The main argument was that the population of the island recently had increased and it was to longer easy to hold general meetings.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The essence of the reform is as follows. From the moment of its coming into effect all the citizens were divided into K (may be not equal) groups. Votes on every question were to be held then in each group, moreover, the group was said to vote “for” if more than half of the group had voted “for”, otherwise it was said to vote “against”. After the voting in each group a number of group that had voted “for” and “against” was calculated. The answer to the question was positive if the number of groups that had voted “for” was greater than the half of the general number of groups.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">At first the inhabitants of the island accepted this system with pleasure. But when the first delights dispersed, some negative properties became obvious.

Then it is enough for the party to have only three supporters in each of the first two groups.

<LI>At most one stitch can lie on each diagonal of each cell at each side of the cloth.</LI>
<LI>Each thread makes up several stitches arranged alternately at different sides of the cloth. (It means that two consecutive stitches formed by one thread lay at the different sides of the cloth and are connected in the grid vertex)</LI>

The blocks are to be numbered by integers from 1 up to <i>N</i>. When operating system needs more memory it makes a request to the memory management module. To process this request the memory management module should find free memory block with the least number. You may assume that there are enough blocks to process all requests.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Now we should define the meaning of words “free block”.

What does it mean, “request to allocated block”? The answer is simple: at any time the memory management module may be requested to access a given block. To process this request the memory management module should check if the requested block is really allocated. If it is, the request is considered to be successful and the block remains allocated for <i>T</i> minutes more. Otherwise the request is failed.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">That's all about the algorithms of the memory management block.

One example of beautification by TeX is that it uses `` (two

quotations, rather than the mundane " (one double quote) which is provided by 
most keyboards. Keyboards typically do not have an oriented double-quote, 
but they do have a left-single-quote (`) and right-single-quote ('). 
TeX lets the user type two left-single-quotes (``) to create a 
left-double-quote and two right-single-quotes ('') to 
create a right-double-quote.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Now, you have a text only file containing

of automation you want to convert the quotes into the TeX format by using a 
program. This program will convert the text with double-quotes (") into an 
identical text except that double quotes have been replaced by the 
two-character sequences required by TeX for delimiting quotations with 
oriented double-quotes. The double-quote (") characters should be 
replaced appropriately by proper double single quotes depending on whether it is 
an opening or closing quotation mark. Question of nested quotations does not 
arise. The first " must be replaced by ``, the next by '', the next by 
``, the next by '', and so on. An opening 
double quote must have its closing quote in the same paragraph. If a match is 
not found in the same paragraph for an opening quote, this quote has to be 
deleted. Paragraph ends in the source text are marked either by at least one 
blank line, or a \par command or both. Your program must also be careful about 
the \" command which is used to produce umlaut or dieresis (\"e

There are eight white and eight red draughts on the board at the beginning of the game. The red side starts the game by making the first turn. The turn consists of selecting an arbitrary draught of player’s colour and pushing it with a flick into a certain direction. Then this draught begins to move in this direction until it completely falls off the board. If it hits or even just touches another draught of any colour during the movement, the latter is immediately removed from the board being considered killed. In any case the moving draught continues its movement without changing its speed or direction.

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Of course all of you want to know how to become ACM world champions. There is no exact answer to this question but it is well known that the champions of the last two ACM World Finals enjoyed playing the following funny card game. Two or more players can play this game simultaneously. It is played using a standard 54-card deck. At the beginning the players sit forming a circle. One of the players shuffles the deck and then he deals the cards in clockwise order starting from the neighbour on his left. He deals the top card of the deck to the current player each time. He does it until each player gets five cards. Then he takes the top card of the deck and lays it onto the table face up and he also lays the remainder of the deck nearby (these cards are laid face down preserving their original order). The card laid by the shuffler is considered as the first turn of the game (as if it was made by the shuffler to the player on his left). 
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The normal game flow as following: the player should cover the last laid card with the card of the same suit or value. If he has none, he takes one card from the top of the deck and again checks this condition. If still there are no matching cards, the move will go to the next player (his left neighbour). But for some cards special rules are applied:
<OL>
<LI> If the laid card is 6, the player takes one card from the top of the deck and skips his turn
<LI> If the laid card is 7, the player takes two cards from the top of the deck (if there is only one card in the deck, he takes just it) and skips his turn
<LI> If the laid card is Ace the player skips his turn without taking any cards
<LI> If the player lays Queen, he himself announces the suit of the card it should be covered with
<LI> Eight is one of the most powerful weapons in this game. When it is laid, the next player has to cover it in any case. If he cannot cover it with his cards he has to take cards from the deck, until he is able to cover it.
<LI> And the most important card in the game is the King of Spades. If it's laid, the next player takes 4 cards from the top of the deck (if there is not enough cards in the deck, he takes all of them) and skips his turn.
</OL>
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">You may assume that the deck is looped and the laid cards are immediately moving to the bottom of the deck. So it can happen that the player has to cover the card by itself.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">We should say some words about Jokers. Jokers can have any card value by the wish of the player who has it. If the player lays the joker, he assigns a definite card value and suit for it, so this Joker has this assigned value until another player takes it from the deck (if it ever happens). The player is free to use or not to use the Joker whenever he wants (if it is his turn to play, of course).
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">If the player is left without any cards in his hand, he is considered a winner and the game continues without him (his left neighbour becomes the left neighbour of his right neighbour).

If one of them has a special combination of cards, it may happen that he can lay out all his cards in a some sequence so that the other player won't get a move (he'll just have to take cards from the deck and skip turns) and will be the loser — provided the first one finds the winning sequence.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">You will be given the position of the game in which only two players are left. Your task will be to determine whether such a winning sequence for the first player exists or not.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">We will consider that the first player have already taken all cards from the deck that he had to (if any), so he cannot take any cards from the deck.

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Your team was hired by the international corporation ACM
(Analytical Calculation Maxims). Every year ACM creates and
conducts various surveys. Surveys themselves are simple forms
with a list of questions and a list of possible answers for
every question. Surveys are distributed around the globe,
where field agents question the target group of people.
All the answers are gathered in the ICPC
(International Computation and Processing Center), where
teams of well-paid analysts mine raw data in
search for relevant correlations. The raw data for each
individual survey consists of lots of lines of answers.
Each line corresponds to every questioned person and
for every question lists answers that the person has
made on that particular survey.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The first step of analysis that your team was 
hired to automate is to create cross tables that 
correlate answers on interesting pairs of questions.
In its most simple way, given a pair of questions,
cross table has a row for every possible answer
on the first question, and has a column for every possible
answer on the second question. Each cell of the cross
table contains a number of lines in the raw data that
has both answers for the corresponding questions at
the same time.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">However, your task is complicated by the fact that
you are to compute and output not only simple cross
table values, but also total values for every row and
column in the cross table (that is the sum of values in the
corresponding row and column) that are placed in an
additional last column and last row, as well as
a percentage distributions for every row and column.
Percentage distribution for a row is an additional number
in every cell in that row that shows percent ratio
of the value in that cell to the total value for that
row, unless the total value is zero (in that case
percentage distribution for this row is not defined).
The same applies to the percentage distributions of
columns. Thus, the cross table in your output will have 
at most three values in every cell (the value itself,
row-wise percent, and column-wise percent). 
Please note, that percentage distributions also apply
to totals. For example, in the total column for every 
row the row-wise percent will be always 100%, unless
the total value for the row is zero (in that case 
row-wise percents are not defined), and column-wise
percent shows percents ratio of the total value for this
row to the total number of lines in the raw data (which
is the value that can be found in the last column
of the last row).</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Percents are rounded to integers on output. 
Percent that has a non-zero fractional part
is rounded to either the smallest integer number greater 
than the resulting percent, or the largest integer number 
smaller than the resulting percent, in such a way, that 
the sums of all corresponding row-wise percents by row 
(without row totals) or column-wise percents by column
(without column totals) are equal to 100% unless they
are undefined. There are various rounding algorithms 
that produce results satisfying the above constraints. 
You are free to use any rounding algorithm as long as
the above constraints are satisfied.</DIV></DIV>

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Castaway Robinson Crusoe is living alone on a remote island.
One day a ship carrying a royal library has wrecked nearby.
Usually Robinson brings any useful stuff from the shipwreck to his
island, and this time he has brought a big chest with books.</DIV></DIV><IMG SRC="http://acm.timus.ru/images/usu-summer.jpg" BORDER="0" ALT="Problem illustration" ALIGN="RIGHT" CLASS="problem_raimage"><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Robinson has decided to build a bookcase for these books to create
his own library. He cut a rectangular niche in the rock for that purpose,
hammered in wooden pegs, and placed wooden planks on every pair of pegs 
that have the same height, so that all planks are situated horizontally
and suit to act as shelves.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Unfortunately, Robinson has discovered that one especially old and big
tome does not fit in his bookcase. He measured the height and width of this
tome and has decided to redesign his bookcase in such a way, as to completely
fit the tome on one of the shelves, taking into account locations of other
shelves and the dimensions of the niche. With each shelf in the bookcase,
one of the following operations should be made:

<ol>

<li>Leave the shelf on its original place.</li>

<li>Move the shelf to the left or to the right.</li>

<li>Shorten the shelf by cutting off a part of the plank and optionally
move it to the left or to the right.</li>

<li>Move one of the pegs to a different place at the same height and 
move the shelf to the left or to the right.</li>

<li>Shorten the shelf by cutting off a part of the plank, move one of the
pegs to a different place at the same height, and optionally move the
shortened shelf to the left or to the right.</li>

<li>Remove the shelf from the bookcase along with both supporting pegs.</li>
</ol>
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">We say that the shelf is properly supported by its pegs, if exactly two
distinct pegs support the shelf and the center of the shelf is between its
pegs or coincides with one of the pegs. The original design of Robinson's
library has all the shelves properly supported by their pegs and lengths of
all shelves are integer number of inches. The Robinson may only cut an integer
number of inches from the planks, because he has no tools for more precise
measurements. All remaining shelves after the redesign must be properly
supported by their pegs.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">You are to find the way to redesign Robinson's library to fit the special
old tome without changing original design too much. You have to minimize the
number of pegs that are to be removed from their original places during
the redesign (operations 4 and 5 remove one peg, and operation 6 removes
two pegs). If there are different ways to solve the problem, then you are
to find the one that minimizes the total length of planks that are to be
cut off (operations 3 and 5 involve cutting something from the planks,
and operation 6 counts as if cutting off the whole plank). Width of
planks and diameter of pegs shall be considered zero.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The tome may not be rotated. The tome should completely (to all its width)

But there are other strategies to find <I>E</i> for sure with much less amount of experiments.

outlawed throughout the world on the grounds of national security concerns. 
The reasoning for this is clear and widely accepted by all governments - 
if cryptography literature is public like in the old times, then everybody 
(even criminals and terrorists) could easily use it to hide their
malicious plans from the national and international security forces.
Consequently, public cryptographic algorithms and systems have ceased to 
exist, and everybody who needs strong protection for their secrets is forced 
to invent proprietary algorithms.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The ACM Corporation has lots of competitors who are eager to learn its 
trade secrets. Moreover, the job to protect their secrets is complicated by 
the fact, that they are forced to use intercontinental communication lines 
which are easy to eavesdrop on, unlike internal lines of the ACM Corporation
which are well guarded. Therefore, the ACM Corporation have invented the 
Intercontinental Cryptographic Protection Code (ICPC) which they are very 
proud of, and which is considered unbreakable - nobody has even tried to
break it yet, but that is about to change.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The group of hackers was hired by the rival company, which does not disclose
its name to them, to break ICPC. As the first step, they have bribed one of the
programmers who implemented the software for ICPC and have learned how ICPC works.
It turns out, the ICPC uses very long key which is a sequence of bytes generated
by some sophisticated and random physical process. This key is changed weekly and
is used to encrypt all messages that are sent over intercontinental communication
lines during the week. This programmer has also proudly told them, that ICPC is
the fastest code in the world, because (having the benefit of highly sophisticated
code generation) they simply perform bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation between
the bytes of the message and the key. That is, the i<sup>th</sup> byte of the encrypted
message E<sub>i</sub> = K<sub>i</sub> XOR C<sub>i</sub>, where K<sub>i</sub> is the
i<sup>th</sup> byte of the key and C<sub>i</sub> is the i<sup>th</sup> byte of the
original clear-text message.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Having learned how ICPC works, they have started to look for the way to reliably 
obtain the key every week, which is the only thing that is still missing to 
listen for all intercontinental communications of the ACM Corporation 
(eavesdropping on the intercontinental lines themselves has indeed turned out to 
be an easy task). An attempt to bribe the security officers who guard and 
distribute the key has failed, because the security officers (having the 
profession with one the highest salaries of that time) have turned out to be 
too expensive to bribe.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">During the search for alternative solutions, they have stumbled upon a clerk,
who sends weekly newsletters to various employees and departments. Fortunately,
these newsletters are being sent just after the change of the key and the messages
are usually long enough to recover sufficient portions of the key by studying 
original newsletters and their encoded forms. However, they could not
covertly find anyone who will disclose the newsletter contents on a weekly basis,
because all the employees were bound by a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and the 
penalty for the disclosure of any corporate message according to this NDA is death.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Yet they were able to convince this clerk (for a small reward) to do a seemingly
innocent thing. That is, while sending the copies of newsletter throughout the 
corporation, he was instructed to insert an extra space character in the beginning
of some messages but send other copies in their original form. Now the task to
recover the key is straightforward and it is you, who shall create a program 
for this. The program is given two ICPCed messages where the first message
is N bytes, and the second one is N+1 bytes and is the result of encoding the
same clear-text messages as the first one, but with one extra space character
(represented by the byte with the decimal value of 32) in the beginning. The

A long time ago the first shaman of the tribe jumped into one of the seas and drowned while being in a sacred trance. Since then all the land inside this sea is regarded as sacred. According to an ancient law, all shamans must be buried on a sacred land. However, souls of dead shamans cannot get on with each other, so each shaman must be buried on a separate island.

So the tribe's shaman appealed to gods and asked them to help with counting the islands. And the tribe was blessed with a Programmer and a Computer, which came down to earth in a cloud of light and fire. Yes, you are this Programmer, and you are destined to live with these cannibals until you have counted the islands; then you'll be transferred back home.

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">There is a tradition at the USU championships to call the most hard-to-solve problems coffins. But to distribute coffins is also a very difficult problem. Consider a cemetery with places arranged in the form of a rectangle having <I>N</I> rows and <I>M</I> columns (1 &le; <I>N</I>, <I>M</I> &le; 100). At the initial moment of time (t = 0) the cemetery is empty. Incoming coffins are put in the row with empty places that has a minimal number; if there are several empty spaces in this row, then the column with the minimal number is chosen. From time to time the cemetery's clients are visited by their living friends and relatives; it is considered to be a pleasure for the clients. But it's only a headache for the cemetery manager, since because of these visitors he cannot give to new clients places that have been used. Happily, visitors are not perfect, so after some time they forget where their friends have been lying. That is why if a client was not visited for more than successive 1000 days, then on the 1001st day the manager regards the grave as empty. However, relatives of the adjacent clients (of those for whom the differences in the numbers of rows and columns are not greater than 1) may notice strange changes, so the manager puts a new client on a used place only if all the neighboring graves have not been visited for the last 100 days (this is a period of time sufficient for a neighbor's friends to forget who was lying next to him or her). If, notwithstanding all the efforts of the manager, there is no place where he can put a new client, then the client is sent to a crematorium.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">We have a complete list of arriving clients and coming visitors for some period starting from the foundation of the cemetery.

His way starts at his workplace and ends at the point where the thought to continue the work comes to his mind. We know that when Vasechkin runs against a wall he bounds according to the law “the angle of incidence equals to the angle of reflection”. Besides being a very straight person Vasechkin moves from wall to wall in the direct line segment. The baleful front office decided to find out how much time Vasechkin wastes during his promenades. It’s very easy to find out the time by dividing the length of the way that Vasechkin has passed over his average speed (that was measured by the front office beforehand). So it’s necessary to find out the way length! And since Vasechkin’s bumps are well-heard it’s sufficient to know the order of Vasechin’s collisions with walls. May be there is a more simple way to calculate the time wasted by the programmer but he front office believes that its solution of the problem is the most correct.</DIV></DIV>

All coordinates are integers. The fourth line contains the sequence of letters L, R, F, B, denoting the sequential Vasechkin collisions with walls — the left, right, front and back one respectively.

Vovochka, the captain’s son, secretly stole to the ship just before the presentation, set down at the computer and decided to while away the time playing his favorite computer game.

You were recommended to me as a young promising programmer. As you probably know, our new … though how can you know, it's all secret. Well, our department needs a program for the analysis of … let's say signals from … let's call it a locator. This locator is designed for searching for … well, objects, which move in a layer of … no, I can't tell you in a layer of what. The locator is placed on our new … well, it also can move. You'll get the signal through the interface … though it's not important, for you it will be a sequence of numbers, each from 0 to 100. First you find in this sequence a signal from the front wall of the layer, this is a number 95 or greater. If there are several such numbers, the first of them will be regarded as the front wall. And you should take into account that someplace before this number in the sequence there must be a number not exceeding 35, otherwise it's not a wall, it's … well, you don't have to know what. Further you have to check two chan… two places where these objects can be. You'll be given for each of the places two numbers, which are the beginning and the end of the search zone counting from the front wall of the layer. You have to search in these zones for an object, that means you have to find maximal numbers in these zones of numbers. If a maximal number is equal to or greater than a certain level, which you'll be given, then you report that you have found an object and give us its location. If there are several maximal numbers in a search zone, we regard only the first of them as an object. There's another complication: the width of the layer is not constant though it has a lower bound, and you'll have to watch for a signal from the back wall of the layer. This signal is also a number 95 or greater and it must be not earlier than after a certain amount of numbers from the front wall. Note that somewhere between the front and the back wall there must be a number not exceeding 35. Of course, if you don't find a signal from the front wall, you don't have to search for objects or the back wall at all. And you don't have to search for anything behind the back wall. I suppose you understand that a signal from the back wall may fall into a search zone, then you don't  regard it as an object.

The decay coefficient for the m-th number is calculated by the formula 1 + (m &minus; f) &middot; А, where f is the location of the front wall, and the value А will be given to you later.

But physicists have recently discovered an amazing phenomenon. They believe the duration of the hyperjump alpha phase can be easily controlled. Alpha phase is the period when hyper-spacecraft accumulates its gravity potential. The larger is the gravity potential accumulated, the less energy is required to complete the hyperjump. 
Your task is to write a program, which would help pilots decide when to enter and when to leave the alpha-phase, in order for the hyperspacecraft to accumulate the largest possible gravity potential.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The most crude gravity field model (which you will have to use) yields the sequence of integers <i>p<SUB>i</sub></i>, which represent field intensities at different moments in time.

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The “U.S. Robots” HQ has just received a rather alarming anonymous letter. It states that the agent from the competing «Robots Unlimited» has infiltrated into “U.S. Robotics”. «U.S. Robots» security service would have already started an undercover operation to establish the agent’s identity, but, fortunately, the letter describes communication channel the agent uses. He will publish articles containing stolen data to the “Solaris” almanac. Obviously, he will obfuscate the data, so “Robots Unlimited” will have to use a special descrambler (“Robots Unlimited” part number NPRx8086, specifications are kept secret).</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Having read the letter, the “U.S. Robots” president recalled having hired the “Robots Unlimited” ex-employee John Pupkin.

However, after he struggled the problem for a while, he remembered that the design of NPRx8086 was still incomplete. “Robots Unlimited” fired John when he was working on a specific module, the text direction detector. Nobody else could finish that module, so the descrambler will choose the text scanning direction at random. To ensure the correct descrambling of the message by NPRx8086, agent must encode the information in such a way that the resulting secret message  reads the same both forwards and backwards.<BR>

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The Psylonian race is known to wield by far the most advanced military battle-robots. During the fight for Terra, it took four of these battle-robots only three hours to completely wipe out one of the ancient cities with adjacent territories. You’d better watch your back with them. The Earth Defense Forces command is utterly preoccupied. Personnel is being trained for military operations against Psylonians in case the armed conflict bursts out again. But working out good tactics requires modeling of the battle-robot’s artificial intelligence unit. And you are to help us!</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The robot’s behavior turned out to be rather simple. He can use just four basic patterns: “Defense”, “Attack”, “Guard” and “Patrol”. Moreover, the behavior control unit you have to model implements a rather simple scheme: it takes some parameters as input and outputs one of the following commands for the robot to execute:<BR>
LEFT X – spend X energy units for turning left;<BR>
RIGHT X – spend X energy units for turning right;<BR>
FRONT X – spend X energy units for moving forward;<BR>
BACKWARD X – spend X energy units for moving backward;<BR>
FIRE P – spend P fire units for attacking the enemy;<BR>
STOP – nothing to do.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">In all these cases X is calculated as follows: If the robot’s power supply has more than 100 energy units available, then X = 100; otherwise, X is the amount of power units remaining. Similarly, P is calculated as the smallest of two values: 20 and the actual amount of ammunition units remaining.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The most simple behavioral pattern is “Guard”. When it’s active, robot does not walk, it can only turn. It picks the most dangerous target, and determines angle between robot’s current line of sight and direction to the target. If the angle is less than 5 degrees (by absolute value), robot shoots. Otherwise, if the angle is greater than or equals to 5, the robot turns left; if the angle is less than or equals to -5, the command is to turn right. If there are no targets around, robot does nothing.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">According to the “Defense” pattern, robot’s actions are defined as follows: calculate the number of enemies and multiply it by 20. If the result is not less than the amount of ammunition units left, the robot will “Retreat and Return Fire”. Otherwise, it will act as if following the “Guard” pattern.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The “Attack” pattern works as follows: If N*NP &gt; M*MP*3, then the robot will “Advance and Return Fire”; else it will “Retreat and Return Fire”. Here: N is the total number of allied battle-robots; NP is the average amount of energy units they have remaining; M is the total number of enemy robots; MP is the average amount of energy units the enemy robots have remaining.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">When the battle-robot “Retreats and Returns Fire”, it checks the angle to the most dangerous enemy. If the angle is 5 degrees or more, or there are no enemies, the robot just moves backward. Otherwise, it fires its guns. </DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Similarly, when the battle-robot “Advances and Returns Fire”, it checks the angle to the most dangerous enemy. If the angle is 10 degrees or more, or there are no enemies, the robot just moves forward or shoots otherwise.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">When “Patrolling”, the robot follows its waypoint route, if there are no enemies. If the robot encounters enemy when patrolling, then it acts as if the “Defense” pattern was active. When following a route, robot uses this algorithm to move to the next waypoint:</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">If the angle to the next waypoint exceeds 20 degrees by absolute value, the robot turns into direction to waypoint. Note that it does not matter whether the robot is moving forward or backward while following the route. You should consider this when calculating the turn direction - the turn angle should be minimal.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Otherwise, if the angle to the next waypoint does not exceed 20, then the robot just moves towards the next waypoint.</DIV></DIV>

On the third line there are three integers: amount of enemies, average amount of energy units enemy bots possess, and angle to the most dangerous enemy target.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">If the robot follows the “Attack” pattern, then the fourth line contains two integers: amount of allied bots and average amount of power units remaining in their power supplies, respectively.

Large hailstones are detected by a special radar and evaporated by a powerful laser. The parking lot has the shape of a convex polygon and is surrounded by a high fence. The height of the fence is <i>h</i> meters. The laser is located somewhere strictly inside this polygon at the ground level. The laser can evaporate hailstones, which pass at a distance of no more than <i>d</i> meters from it. The fence is impenetrable for laser beams. Hailstones fall vertically downward. It is known that the location and power of the laser are such that it can destroy all hailstones falling to the territory of the parking lot before they reach the level of the upper edge of the fence. The laser destroys all hailstones it can, regardless of whether they would fall inside or outside the fence. The laser can perform all the necessary operations instantly, so it can destroy several hailstones in different places practically simultaneously.

It was just a square set of shelves where a porter puts guests' mail. Usual hotels have usual stands with shelves for this purpose. But this cool designer had turned everything upside down!

Moreover, the cells should be numbered from the right to the left, from the top to the bottom, looking at THIS, staying on its corner, of course. Tell me please, how can the master attach the labels with numbers to THIS? He will look on the shelves, staying normally on its side, you know. He will get tangled on the fourth label already!

There he suddenly understood that using an alien computer was not so nice. The computer he was working on even didn't have his favorite text editor. And, unfortunately, the program committee had given a text formatted by a nasty DOS text editor in such a way that all right ends of lines were at the same level. Of course, it had been performed by inserting extra spaces in many places. To read such a text was a torture for Petrov. It was his luck he found the FAR Manager, which could help to delete all these disgusting spaces replacing a combination of two spaces by one space. However, there were too many spaces, so such operation had to be performed several times, because after a replacement FAR did not search for the specified combination in the processed text. For example, if there are six successive spaces, then after one round of replacement the first two spaces are replaced by one space, the middle two spaces are replaced by one space, and the last two spaces are replaced by one space. As a result, we have three successive spaces. The second round of replacement deletes the first two of the three spaces and puts one space instead of them. So we need one more round of replacement, which replaces the remaining two spaces by one space. On the whole, three rounds of replacement are needed.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Petrov had already pressed Ctrl+F7, but than had a sudden thought: what if he first replaced each three spaces by one, and then each two spaces by one?

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Today almost everybody knows about the scientific research department of the Night Watch, located in Solovetz city. Due to the artful actions of Zavulon (the boss of Day Watch, you know) this Scientific Research Institute for Thaumaturgy and Spellcraft (SCITS) was absolutely declassified and removed from secret list already in 60s.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">However this fact had not made any harm to its ability of research work. For example right now 3<SUP>rd</sup>-level wizard Vitka Korneev tests a new battle-spell of fireball in his lab in SCITS. Oh… fireball is such a ball of fire that is used for… m-m-m… for neutralization of undesirable consequences.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">New fireball appeared to be just an ingenious invention! First of all due to the incongruence of transgression inside the incub-transformation’s psy-field it has a zero radius. But its  greatest characteristic is the ability of remaining stable during the predefined number of collisions with obstacles. This characteristic is called <i>N</i>-stability: fireball is <i>N</i>-stable if it stays stable after <i>N</i> collisions but explodes after (<i>N</i> + 1)<sup>th</sup> collision. So, you may consider, that <i>N</i>-stable fireball loses one level of stability and becomes (<i>N</i> − 1)-stable after each collision with a wall. For example ordinary fireball is 0-stable. So with this invention it became possible to strike an enemy with fireball after several ricochets from the walls. So the military value of this invention is beyond questions. In addition, new <i>N</i>-stable fireball (<i>N</i> &gt; 0) has quite unusual behavior: After collisions it rebounds only from concrete walls! So, it easily flies through any other obstacles. (The theory ties this fact with the accumulation of bio-emotional energy by all static constructions of living quarters). This fact, as you can guess, causes additional military value of new invention: now it is not necessary to provide clear trajectory for the thrown fireball — it will fly thwough any obstacles before it damages the target.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">But it is long way from the first prototype to the mass usage. First of all it is necessary to investigate the trajectory of the fireball flight. The following experiment is prepared for this purpose: in the rectangle room two points <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are being chosen at random. One wizard stands at the point <i>A</i> and the target is placed at the point <i>B</i>. Wizard creates <i>N</i>-stable fireball while his assistant calculates the direction of throw with the help of special program. The direction of throw is selected such way that thrown fireball rebounds from the walls exactly <i>N</i> times and then hits the target. At the same time it should do this with the shortest trajectory (i.e. as quickly as possible).</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">So, you are to write this special program for direction calculation. The scientists of SCITS tell that all fireballs rebound from the walls according to the law: “angle of incidence equals angle of reflection”. And after collision with room’s corner it rebounds exactly in the opposite direction. Moreover, the theory of fireballs says that, due to continuity, one collision with corner equals two collisions with walls. So, 2-stable fireball explodes after the second collision if the first was with room’s corner. And finally you may assume that the fireball is a point moving in straight lines with constant velocity.</DIV></DIV><IMG SRC="http://acm.timus.ru/images/usu-summer.jpg" BORDER="0" ALT="Problem illustration" ALIGN="RIGHT" CLASS="problem_raimage">

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">It is very hard for one person to learn all galactic history. But, on the other hand, every diplomat who wants to hold a more important post in a galactic empire must know the subject well.

(Didn’t you hear that the last conflict between systems Arcturus and Alpha flamed up because of the only shattered glass?)</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Fortunately, the solution was found in the Galactic Academy.

Of course, it is necessary to learn history in chronological order, beginning from the origin of humanity. That’s why the history of the Earth needs to be included in all collections of separate histories. Then things become complicated: for example, emigrants from Centaurus system colonized the star system of Herdsman, so the textbook on the history of Herdsman system has to contain the early history of Centaurus system. In order to decide, in which textbooks which phases of history should be included, historians of Galactic Academy divided general intergalactic history into many small milestones. Then all milestones were combined into one big tree (omnipresent biologists helped historians in this work, as they had always been using these trees). The milestone referring to early history of the Earth (before the space colonization) was declared the root. Milestones referring to history of star systems close to solar system appear to be its sons (because these systems were colonized by emigrants from Earth) and so on. That’s all!

No doubt, anyone knows them.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Anyway, a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away there was a space station named &quot;Death star&quot;. For those of you who do not remember it, we would remind that it mostly looked like a big metal ball with lots of turrets on its surface. And somewere between turrets there were towers with maneuring engines on a top of each tower; that allowed the station to turn in space. All the engines were the same: standard krypton engines with autonomous power supply. And all the towers were the same. Each of the engines could be in two distinct states: switched off and switched on to a maximum power. But it was not a problem since each engine could be rotated individually relative to the station.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Unfortunately, the engine control cable was damaged after one of the space battles: it was melted by the direct hit of a rebel laser weapon. So all the manoeuvre drives became uncontrollable. All of them which were at maximal power just kept working. Switched off engines remained in that state. Death Star won the battle, but stuck manoeuvre drives made a strange effect: instead of smooth and majestic movement through space, station makes unpredictable rotations which are unsuitable for the Imperial fleet flagship.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">It makes Emperor annoyed. No, not just annoyed but furious, because it seems to him that the station rotates faster and faster, and he already feels nauseous.

And you have to do this really quickly.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">You may have thought that you would need to solve a lot of complex differential equations and to write engine controlling program. No, not at all. As a station engineer, you must know that jet thrust of a maintenance engine does not change over time. It depends on jet nozzle size only. So you only have to find the suitable place for the engine tower, calculate jet nozzle size, set up thrust vector and switch the maintenance engine on. No matter how you do it.

Suits are usual: Spades, Clubs, Diamonds and Hearts.

</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Each player must follow the suit of the first card in a trick, if possible. Otherwise, he may discard any card from his hand.

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">At Ural Championship 2004 there was a task "<A href="/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1308">Dean's pyramid</A>". Briefly it looks like the following:
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal"><BLOCKQUOTE>
There is an egiptian like glass pyramid on the table of Ural State University mathematics and mechanics faculty dean. The faculty legend says that before weak student gets sent down, dean gives the student the last chance. He puts unsigned list of dismissed students at one side of the table, and puts the pyramid at another side. If the student is able to move the pyramid to the locus of deans signature on the dismissing listplace, by rolling the pyramid over the edges for no more than 70 times, the student 
stays at the faculty (for the last time).
</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal"><BLOCKQUOTE>
The task was to determine, how close the pyramid can be moved to the target point under the following conditions. The pyramids base is square and its lateral faces are regular triangles. You can roll the pyramid by turning it from one face to the adjacent one over some edge. During this turning the edge should not slide on surface of the table. If after the turn over some edge the pyramid stands on its base, the next turn can be performed either over the same edge or over the opposite edge of the pyramids base only. There are no restrictions on the rolling from the triangle faces.
</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">After Ural Championship 2004 weak students felt secured: now they know the secrets of dean's pyramid and the simplest algorithm to find the points on the table where the pyramid could be. To learn this algorithm is much, much simpler than to learn theorems. And you never get sent down! The only doubt disturbed them: what if authors of the task garbled something...</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">And they were right: looking at the hidden camera picture it was found that side faces of the pyramid were not regular triangles, but only isosceles one! And strange rule of rolling the pyramid could be just a fiction of task authors... Weak students feel distress again...</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">You see, this could be a legend. And could be a truth. The pyramid is so real, and it looks so beautiful at the dean's table...
So help the students for the last time. Try to determine the best way of rolling the pyramid to put it as close as possible to the point of dean's signature.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">You are given a number N &mdash; the maximum number of rolls allowed by the dean. You are also given an exact size of the pyramid: the length of an edge of square face A<SUB>1</SUB> and the length of a side edge A<SUB>2</SUB>. Both lengths are given in centimetres. It was estimated by eye that a value of A<SUB>2</SUB>/A<SUB>1</SUB> is in a range from 0.9 to 1.9. It is known that the dean is severe enough, so he puts dismissing list far enough from the pyramid. You may assume that the pyramid is originally 
placed not closer than 20.05 * A<SUB>1</SUB> to the point of the dean's signature.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Pyramid originally stands on its base with 
a center of the base placed at the point (0,0) and with edges of the base parallel to the axes of coordinate system. You are to find the sequence of rolls by which the pyramid gets to the point (X,Y) as close as possible. After the last roll the pyramid
again must stand on its base, though edges of the base could be arbitrary oriented.
But the distance between the center of the pyramid base and the point (X,Y) must be as small as possible. In the case of tie, you also have to minimize the number of rolls. You are allowed to make less than N rolls.
The pyramid can be rolled from one face to another only via their common edge. And the edge should not slide on surface of the table during the roll.</DIV></DIV>

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Petya lives in a many-storied building where each flat occupies an entire story. Petya has studied local flora and fauna for many years. Having performed montly metering, he notices the following peculiarities:
<ul>
<li> The number of cockroaches in each of the flats is an integer ranged from 0 to <i>N</i>, where <i>N</i> is a non-negative number not exceeding 30.</li>
<li> The number of cockroaches in a flat during a month is a function of three arguments: the number of cockroaches in this flat and the flats
above and below this one during the previous month.</li>
</ul>
Petya becomes interested in inducing the ways the insects' population size changes under these laws. To avoid the special cases of ground
floor and top floor, where the laws might be more complicated, Petya decided to solve this problem for an infinite-storied skyscraper. Let's consider that the number of cockroaches can decrease if they can be distributed among the flats (having no more than <i>N</i> in any) in such a way that in the next month the total number of cockroaches in the building will decrease. Only a finite number of cockroaches can exist in the building; thus, all the flats, except a finite number of them, are free from these insects. Likewise, the number of cockroaches can increase if they can be distributed among the flats in such a way that in the next month the total number of cockroaches in the building will increase (and may possibly become infinite).</DIV></DIV>

To save his pet from starving to death, Tyomitch wishes to select such a spot for the stake, and such a length for the rope, that the goat could deal with as large area of the garden as possible. However, there's a little problem: the goat, when left alone with the garden, tries to pierce the garden's fence with its horns. The goat will succeed if it can reach the fence with its horns and the rope has even a little slack at this moment. Tyomitch wants to avoid the traces of the uninvited guests getting noticed by the neighbors, so he tries to bound the goat in such a way that the fence would remain safe and sound.

The snake can creep in 3 ways relative to its current direction: forward, to the left or to the right. All the cells of snake's body move at once, each moving into the place of preceding one, except for the head cell. Here are the examples of snake's movement:
<ul>
<li><pre>321. -> .321</pre></li>
<li>
<pre>
321 -> .32
...    ..1
</pre>
</li>

.3    1.
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
12 -> 23

</pre>
</li>
</ul>
The snake creeps through exactly one cell per unit of time, or perishes if it has nowhere to creep into.</DIV></DIV>

The time was over when buyers were taking away the purchased goods from a store immediately after buying them. Now they demanded a free delivery and wanted to be telephoned in advance in order to agree upon the time of delivery. 
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">There are ten “Rodonit” stores in the city. The director understands that it is not always rational to deliver items directly from the stores where they were bought. On the outskirts of the city, there is a warehouse of household appliances, and next to the warehouse there is a garage. Every night employees compile a list of goods that have been bought during the day, with information about the buyers: names, addresses, and telephone numbers. These goods are delivered during the next day. The company has only one lorry for delivering goods. The lorry has a limited carrying capacity, therefore several trips are sometimes necessary to deliver the goods. The employees arrange the delivery schedule: which items should the lorry driver take from the warehouse for each trip and the order of visits to the buyers. 
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">In order to save the fuel, the total length of the trips must be minimal. The employees use a city map to measure the distances between objects (which are the warehouse and the houses of the buyers from the list) and start the complicated optimization process.

<li>The distance between the warehouse and the garage is 0.</li>
<li>Let <i>D</i>(<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>) be the distance between objects <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. Then for any objects <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>

<li>In the end of each trip the lorry must return to the garage.</li>
<li>The sum of the masses of the goods carried by the lorry at one time must not exceed its carrying capacity.</li>

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Mars Jumper is a new improved model of Moon Rover. Clever heads from the engineering department
proved that in the conditions of low gravity it's easier to jump, so the new vehicle moves by jumping. By
the way, the length of its jump is always one meter. Mars Jumper is controlled with a standard computer
keyboard. To assign the direction of jumping, one uses the complementary digit keys (those which are
on the right). It is very convenient and handy: 8 means a jump northward, 2 means a jump southward,
6 means a jump eastward, 7 means a jump to the north-west, and so on. 5 is an order to take a sample
of soil. In order to use the zero key, the chief engineer invented one more function: if this key is pressed,
the motor of the vehicle is self-destroyed. He thinks that this function could be very useful.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Of course, to operate the Jumper is not an easy task. Not anyone can quickly move the vehicle, for

a trial, the chief engineer seated his daughter at a computer and oered her to press some buttons. The

position of Mars Jumper. The testing area is considered to be an innite plane.</DIV></DIV>

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The Sunny Town keeps pace with modern technologies. Not much time has passed since cellular
communication was introduced in the town, yet Shpuntik and Vintik have already designed their own
mobile phone with a built-in location transmitter. With this phone, no one of the Mites (especially
Neznaika) will get lost, because Vintik and Shpuntik will be able to know his location. Now the new
phone must be tested. It is decided to carry out the testing in the following way. Shpuntik goes around
the town with the phone and writes down its readings on a piece of paper. All of this time Vintik is at the
workshop and traces Shpuntik's travel watching a special monitor. When Shpuntik is back, they compare
their records. But there's one problem: Shpuntik's record is a list of lines with the phone's readings, and
Vintik has a list of numbers describing Shpuntik's travel. Write a program that generates Shpuntik's list
using Vintik's list under the assumption that the system works correctly.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The mobile phone that undergoes testing has a chromatic indicator of the signal's power and shows the
identier of the current cell. The indicator can show seven dierent colors, namely, the colors of a rainbow.
Violet corresponds to the strongest signal and red means that the signal is vanishing and the phone may
become disconnected any moment.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">If the distance between the phone and a base station is less then a certain value, then the signal is ideal
(which corresponds to the violet color of the indicator). This threshold distance may be dierent for
dierent stations. If the phone is moved away from a base station further than the threshold distance,
then the indicator goes indigo, then blue, green, and so on, until it becomes red and not changes anymore
as the signal decreases further. The indicator's color changes each time the signal's power falls 2 decibels.
The signal's power depends only on the distance from a base station and is in inverse proportion to this
distance. For example, when the distance increases two times, then the power decreases also two times.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The phone selects a base station according to the following rules:

the cell is selected among them.</li>
<LI>The phone stays connected to the same station until its signal goes red; then it switches to the
search mode and tries to select a new station.</li>
<LI>The phone is in the search mode until it finds a station whose signal's level is enough for turning the indicator any color excepting red. If there are several such stations, then the phone uses the same selection rule as in the case of turning on.</li>

When one compares not powers, but, say, voltages,
then another formula is used: <NOBR>20 · log<SUB>10</sub>(U<SUB>b</sub>/U<SUB>a</sub>)</NOBR>, but Vintik and Shpuntik use the first one.</DIV></DIV>

Nightmares harassed Mr. Petroff all month long when he painted a series of pictures named "Quadrangles".

Then he connected each pair of the basic points by segments and covered the resulting figure with paint. However the painter is not good in geometry, so sometimes he created triangles or even segments instead of quadrangles.

At the same time it should be remembered that each picture is a square 20000*20000 with a center at point (0, 0), and the rectangle should fit this square.

Its underground vaults are located hundreds of kilometres below London and are guarded by powerful spells and dragons. Goblins created the complicated system of vaults and tunnels using hyperworms.

very powerful snake and devours everything on its way leaving behind a smooth and durable tunnel. Goblins can summon and control a hyperworm by magic, forcing the animal to dig a tunnel in a required direction.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Though hyperworms are very powerful and easy to use, gnomes and other underground creatures do not use them, because hyperworms can only move devouring earth or stones. This means that if a hyperworm has finished digging a tunnel to a required destination

penalty must be paid for the death of each of them. But goblins don't care much about laws underground, where nobody can see them. What they really care about is the security of the bank, so they never dig more than one tunnel between a pair of rooms.

His task is to feed a dwarf elephpotamus. Harry remembers that
elephpotamuses are very straightforward and imperturbable. In
fact, they are so straightforward that always move along a straight
line and they are so imperturbable that only move when attracted
by something really tasty. In addition, if an elephpotamus
stumbles into a chain of its own footprints, it falls into a
stupor and refuses to go anywhere. According to Hagrid,
elephpotamuses usually get back home moving along their
footprints. This is why they never cross them, otherwise they
may get lost. When an elephpotamus sees its footprints, it tries
to remember in detail all its movements since leaving home (this
is also the reason why they move along straight lines only, this
way it is easier to memorize). Basing on this information, the
animal calculates in which direction its burrow is situated, then
turns and goes straight to it.
It takes some (rather large) time for an elephpotamus to perform
these calculations. And what some ignoramuses recognize as a
stupor is in fact a demonstration of outstanding calculating
abilities of this wonderful, though a bit slow-witted creature.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Elephpotamuses' favorite dainty is elephant pumpkins, and some of

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Many centuries ago Martians switched to using huge robots
for military operations. During the current Moon conquest
campaign, all of the Martian army is located at the headquarters
on Mars, and each person is controlling the actions of his 
robot. There is a strict hierarchy in the Martian army: each
person excepting the general (there is only one general in the 
army) has a direct commander. According to the army regulations, 
communication is allowed only between a commander and his direct 
subordinate. The communication is carried out via the headquarters
local network. At the headquarters, each military person has 
his own computer, and computers are numbered from 1 to <i>N</i>, 
where <i>N</i> is the size of the Martian army. It is a tradition 
that a subordinate's computer has number that is greater than the 
number of his commander's computer. Each military person,
in addition to the number of his computer, is characterized by 
his reliability. This is a real number; the owner of the computer
<i>i</i> has reliability <i>A<sub>i</sub></i>. The general has 
reliability 1, and soldiers (soldiers and only they have no 
subordinates) have reliability 0.

The complication is that the volume of traffic between any 
two headquarters computers is a state secret, and is unknown 
even to the provider. Every month the provider sends a bill, and 
the military write there the traffic (a whole number of 
megabytes) themselves. Let a commander and his subordinate
have computers with numbers <i>i</i> and <i>k</i> respectively.
According to the contract with the provider, the traffic 
between the computers <i>i</i> and <i>k</i> must be
not less than <i>A<sub>i</sub></i>–<i>A<sub>k</sub></i>. 
In the beginning of every month, the provider's representatives
know the hierarchy in the Martian army and costs of a megabyte of

animal is born on the farm, the farmer has to know which kind it is.
He can recognize cockroaches from other animals himself, but to 
distinguish a camel from a sheep he needs help in the form of a
commission of experts. The commission measures two parameters of 
a new-born animal: the hump's height and the horns' length.
Using this data, the experts determine the kind of the animal 
(camel or sheep).

The <i>i</i>th expert chooses two integers <i>a<sub>i</sub></i>

For an animal with parameters (<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>), the expert 
calculates the value (<i>a<sub>i</sub>A</i> + <i>b<sub>i</sub>B</i>). 
If this value is positive, then the expert decides that this is a 
camel, if the value is negative, then the animal is a sheep, and 
if the value is zero, then the expert is at a loss and abstains 
from voting.

A similar rule applies to the case when strictly more than half of experts 
believe that the animal is a sheep. And if the commission cannot identify 
the animal as a camel or a sheep, then the farmer judges that he has 
one more green cockroach.

The point was that the planned emission (i.e. an issue of a new batch of money) would inevitably cause inflation growth, which, in its turn, might lead to a devaluation of Mr. Thiefton capital, that was plundered with such a great effort. Therefore the desired denomination should be minimized.</DIV></DIV>

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Dance Dance Revolution, or DDR (known as Dancing Stage in Europe) is
a music video games series produced by Konami. As of 2005, over 90
official versions have been produced, including those for home video
game consoles. The game is played on a dance pad with four arrow
panels: left, down, up, and right. These panels are pressed using the
player's feet, in response to arrows that appear on the screen in
front of the player. The arrows are synchronized to the general
rhythm or beat of a chosen song, and success is dependent on the
player's ability to time and position his or her steps accordingly.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_right">From Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">DDR machines are extremely popular in Japan. Gradually they have
won hearts and feet of admirers all over the world and have already
appeared in Ekaterinburg. Especially for severe Ural conditions,
the project Dance Dance Revolution Ural Mix (or, simply, DDRUMix)
based on DDR 5th Mix, which is widespread only in Japan, has been developed.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">DDRUMix operates similarly to other Dance Dance Revolution games:
a player must move his or her feet to the beat of a song
following instructions on the screen. During a game, arrows scroll
upwards from the bottom of the screen. When the scrolling arrows
reach the top of the screen, the player must step on the corresponding
arrow panels on the dance platform. The actions of the player are estimated
by the machine and, after the song, the player is taken to the results screen,
which shows the score and bonus points.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Since DDRUMix is a joint project, the Japanese entrusted leading Ural
programmers with developing the software for the machine. Your task will be
to create the scoring system. For that, you have to know the scoring algorithm.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Each song in DDRUMix has one of the 3 difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, or Hard
depending on its rhythm (Easy for 1 beat per second, Medium for 2 beats per
second, and Hard for 4 beats per second). A period between two consecutive beats
is called a <i>beat-period</i>, for example, a beat-period for the Medium level is
500 milliseconds. Beat-periods during which the player should step on an
arrow panel are called <i>step-periods</i>, and there may also be empty beat-periods
during which the player isn't expected to make any steps. Each beat-period of
a song is assigned a letter: <b>N</b> if it is empty, and <b>U</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>L</b>, or <b>R</b> if
the player should step on the “Up”, “Down”, “Left”, or “Right” arrow panel during
this beat-period.

<li>All non-first steps are not estimated.</li>
<li>If the player has not pressed any panel during the period, then he or she gets “BOO”.</li>
<li>If the first step was wrong, then the player gets “MISS”.</li>
<li>If the first step was correct (i.e., the player has pressed the arrow panel
corresponding to this beat-period), then the estimate depends on
the time between the start of the step-period and the first step: “PERFECT” if
it is less than 40% of the length of the period, “GREAT” if it is no less than
40% but less than 70%, and “GOOD” if it is no less than 70%.</li>

For each step-period in a combo, the player scores q * c combo points, where
the step multiplier q = 55 for “PERFECT”, q = 33 for “GREAT”, and q = 0 in other cases,

there are no scales in workers' toolboxes.

Nevertheless, it's known that GM-pineapples all have the

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Yekaterinburg has an extensive network of tram routes. Trams of more than
ten routes go along some streets. It is clear that rails wear out quickly
because of such a load. Rails near tram stops sometimes are wavy. Many citizens
hold the city authorities responsible for such a poor state of tram railways:
repair works are carried out rarely, and even if rails are replaced, it is only
by cheapest ones&mdash;made of low-grade metal and with wooden ties.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">However, not only authorities are guilty of this situation. Some tram
drivers are fans of fast driving, and they damage both rails and their trams.
If a tram accelerates to a high speed, say 80 kilometers per hour, and then
brakes sharply before a stop, it goes some distance skidding. This leads not

the shipyard sometimes cannot produce enough yachts for their customers.
And those billionaires are quite impulsive people: if they come to the
shipyard and there is no yacht for them, they abandon the whole idea of buying a yacht. Of course,
the shipyard can produce yachts and store them somewhere for future use, but you should pay 1 golden bar to store
one yacht during one month.

In this situation, there were two possible courses of action: either start peace
negotiations with the Rebels and try to find a political solution to the
conflict (and Darth Vader was definitely against that), or substantially cheapen
the cost of constructing Death Stars. The second variant was chosen.
The production was transferred to a neighboring galaxy, where labor was
much cheaper. The industry there had long ago mastered the output of gigantic steel
beams with a length of 1 standard sidereal unit. The assemblage of Death Stars
from such beams was started. The Death Stars had the form of regular
polyhedra (Platonic solids). At each vertex of such a polyhedron, a megagun was
mounted; it could shoot along the ray originating from the center of the polyhedron
and passing through that vertex. When the early-warning station detected an
approaching Rebel ship, the whole Death Star turned so that the nearest megagun
was aimed exactly at the ship. The amount of fuel consumed for the turning was
proportional to the angle of rotation. The shot inevitably destroyed the Rebel's
ship, and the Death Star remained in that position until the next attack.

it unfolds immediately, and to fold it back into a cube you have to waste the precious

if it were possible to fold a snake of an arbitrary configuration into a cube. If
yes, it would find how to do it.</DIV></DIV><IMG SRC="http://acm.timus.ru/images/usu-summer.jpg" BORDER="0" ALT="Problem illustration" ALIGN="LEFT" CLASS="problem_laimage"><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">A snake consists of 27 small cubes that are strung, as beads,

and inside other cubes it turns, going through the centers of adjacent faces.

If a native can inscribe his circle in several ways, he asks the victim for

The train silently slid over magnetic rail, moving people on the ring route

a picture glowed with joy and incessantly repeated: &ldquo;I am happy to be here!&rdquo;
Nikolai highlighted the address of the club and copied it to his address book.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Nikolai disconnected from the communicator when the train approached his station.
He got off the rail and hurried to his apartment building. His apartment was on
the seventeenth floor. It was cramped, but had windows on the sunny side, which
was highly valued. Inside, it was clean, almost void of any traces of a living
being. If a spy infiltrated the apartment, he'd fail to find any object that
bears the traits of Nikolai's personality. To tell the truth, Nikolai himself
didn't know what kind of man was he.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">It didn't take him long time before he left the apartment. He put on different
clothes, now he looked like unemployeed dweller of the lower levels &mdash; long
sleeves hid his communicator and the hood hid his neuroport. Nikolai has
gone directly to one of the three huge elevators which connected the domed
city with the underground levels, where all industry and life-support systems
were concentrated and where majority of the population lived. The elevator
operated similiar to terrestrial ferries &mdash; cars drove in and parked in rows,
passengers bought tickets and took their seats. Finally, the bell ringed,
red lights flashed out and the machine started to creep downwards. For some,
it was an adventurous journey in search of forbidden pleasures; for others,
it was a one-way trip home accompanied by shattered dreams and ruined plans.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">It wasn't the first time Nikolai visited the lower levels. He quickly figured
out where the exclusive club from the ad was located. It was in old mines,
where the first colonists mined for water ice. The web of tunnels spread for
many miles and was considered one of the most dangerous places for the surface
folk. But Nikolai knew how to merge with the crowd and move around without
attracting needless attention. The crowd carried him to the front of a
dilapidated mansion. Nikolai just stood there in hesitation, then he had
checked the address and came in.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The inside of the club was very different. A visitor found himself in a large,
fully illuminated hall with high ceiling. The interior was laid out with
simplicity and style, which gave an impression of enormous wealth. There was
a reception desk on the other end of the hall. A beautiful, exquisite girl
sat behind it. When Nikolai approached the desk, she smiled wide and softly
asked:<br>
&ldquo;Good day to you, sir. Can I have your membership card, please?&rdquo;<br>
Nikolai had lost his concentration for a moment, but braced himself and
confidently said:<br>
&ldquo;I am happy to be here.&rdquo;<br>
The girl smiled even more wide, stood up and said:<br>
&ldquo;We're glad to see you too. Please follow me.&rdquo;<br>
They walked down through the twisting corridor past numerous doors, until
the girl had stopped in front of a red curtain. She invited him to come inside.
Nikolai moved the curtain aside and entered the room.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">А rather large room was partitioned into small cabins by red translucent veils.
There were a couch and a small table inside every cabin. Although the room was
poorly illuminated, Nikolai could see that some of the couches were occupied
by people. Thin smoke curled up at the ceiling, the air was filled with
intoxicating and sweet aroma. A lit lamp was standing on the table in one of
the cabins. Nikolai moved there and sat on the couch.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Less than 5 minutes later, a man entered the neighbouring cabin. Nikolai couldn't
see his face, but there was enough light from the lamp for the man to see Nikolai's
face. He sat down on the couch and asked in a hoarse voice:<br>
&ldquo;Have you brought the money?&rdquo;<br>
Nikolai opened his pocket and pulled a small piece of plastic out of it. He put
the card on the floor under the veil. The man took the card and passed it over
the reader device. The device displayed a number which, apparently, satisfied
the man. He hid the card in one pocket and took something from the other. He put
the thing on the floor and moved it to Nikolai with his foot.<br>
&ldquo;Do not forget two rules,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;First, the Moon
has the death penalty for possession of such a device. Second, there are things
worse than death penalty for those, who can't keep their mouths shut.&rdquo;<br>
Without waiting for a reply, the man stood up and left the room.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Nikolai picked up the device from the floor. It was a polished blue cube with
two neuroports on opposite sides. Nikolai was amazed how simple this notorious
device looked. The official name of the device was &ldquo;Associations Control
Module (ACM)&rdquo;, also known as &ldquo;Brainwasher&rdquo;. Using it, one
could force the creditor to forgive debt, or force arrogant supermodel to fall
in love with a hobo. But Nikolai wasn't planning to use it on other people.
All that he wanted was to know himself. He wanted to remember more than the last
three years of his life.</DIV></DIV><IMG SRC="http://acm.timus.ru/images/usu-summer.jpg" BORDER="0" ALT="Problem illustration" ALIGN="RIGHT" CLASS="problem_raimage"><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Nikolai came back home in the middle of the night. He decided not to waste any
time and plugged himself to the cube. Using his personal terminal, he started
to explore his own brain. Memories of the last three years were easy to locate.
But when he tried to go deeper, he was puzzled. The memory was not wiped out,
but it surely didn't look like a memory of a human being. Meaningless chains
of associations running for absurd lengths, branching and merging, but
inevitably ending in one of the five vivid images. Those images were a whale,
a penguin, a piano, a jackboot, and a train.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Nikolai unplugged himself and began to think. Someone (maybe himself) had
messed with his head. Chains of associations were thoroughly mixed on all
levels. But these five objects had to mean something. Quite possible, it
was a code and he had to find a key. Maybe, the key was something that
connected them together. Nikolai decided to write a program searching
for common associations of a set of objects.</DIV></DIV>

<br>
&ldquo;What's that job like?&rdquo; no wonder, jobless Ivan became interested.
<br>
&ldquo;Have you heard about the company <i>Ostap and Partners</i>? They've
been producing horns and hoofs for a number of years already. And now I'm a
hoof picker of the third class with them!&rdquo; answered Vassily proudly.
<br>
&ldquo;How much do they pay you?&rdquo; Ivan wanted to know.

&ldquo;They don't pay me yet,&rdquo; answered his friend with disappointment.
&ldquo;It's the first month I work there and I'm a probationer. And the guys in the brigade
don't tell me their wages, it's the company's policy.&rdquo; He paused and lowered his voice to a whisper.
&ldquo;But I know that our foreman drives a Mercedes!&rdquo;
<br>
&ldquo;Ah, I would like to know how much money they get,&rdquo; Ivan said dreamily
imagining himself driving a Merc.

&ldquo;I can learn it after all!&rdquo; Vassily had a sudden inspiration. 
&ldquo;The guys like to brag at smoking breaks that their wages are greater than

rubles more than Fyodor. And Fyodor once complained that he was getting

It is true that after the show nobody remembers what it was about and even what

the numerous fans of Hypnotoad from enjoying their favorite show.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">In order to study the amazing properties of Hypnotoad, Professor Farnsworth
constructed a special device, which trapped and scanned its waves. He found out
that at each time moment Hypnotoad's eyes could be in one of <i>n</i> states.
Professor denoted those states by the numbers 0, 1, &hellip;, <i>n</i>&minus;1
for simplicity. The states of the eyes changed according to one of several
linear laws. There were <i>m</i> such laws and each of them could be specified by
five integers:
<i>s</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>t</i><sub>0</sub>, &Delta;<i>s</i>, &Delta;<i>t</i>, <i>k</i>.
When Hypnotoad &ldquo;worked&rdquo; according to such a law, its left eye switched to
the state&nbsp;<i>s</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> and its right eye switched to
the state&nbsp;<i>t</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> successively

could be used to learn many secrets of the Universe. For example, Hypnotoad could
see the dark matter and extract information from black holes. In order to see
the same way Hypnotoad saw, Professor constructed another device that emulated
&ldquo;hypnosight&rdquo;: each of its four oculars could stay in one of the <i>n</i>
states changing according to linear laws. Farnsworth carried out a series of
experiments and decided to draw a diagram in which he would mark for every possible state
of the device whether Hypnotoad's eyes could be in states similar to the states of

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Contestants often wonder what jury members do during a contest. Someone thinks that they spend all the contest fixing bugs in tests. Others say that the jury members
watch the contest excitedly and even bet on who will win. However, in reality, the jury members prefer to play computer games, giving a complete control of the contest to heartless machines.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Another Ball Killer is one of the favorite games of the jury. Its rules are
very simple:

<ol>
<li>The game is played by one person on a rectangular field of size <i>n</i> &times; <i>m</i>. At the initial moment, each cell of the field contains a ball of one of
five colors: blue, green, red, white, or yellow.</li>
<li>At each move, the player chooses some <i>figure</i> (a connected group of two or more balls of the same color; balls are called connected if their cells have a common side) and removes it from the field. After that the balls that were above the removed balls fall down. If a column without the balls appears, then all the columns on its right are shifted to the left.
<br>
The image below shows how the field changes after the removal of the largest figure.
<br>
The player is awarded  <i>k</i> &times; (<i>k</i> &minus; 1) points for his move, where <i>k</i> is the size of the removed figure, i.e. the number of balls in it.</li>

<li>The game is finished when there are no figures left on the field. The goal is to get as many points as possible by the end of the game.</li>

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal"><b>Side one</b></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Poll flew above the City. Bright street lights flashed by below. He was winding his way around needle-sharp spires of communication towers and wicker grid radiators of thermonuclear power plants. Express mail helicopters rushed past him. Suddenly, the neat layout of the streets below was broken. The streets, which used to be straight and parallel, had started to twist and twirl like a bunch of glowing tentacles. Poll soared upwards. Looking down from above, Poll no longer saw streets. Instead, he saw a neural network &mdash; live and pulsating with energy. One of the neurons flashed and faded to black. Its neighbours were saturated with energy and burst too. With each impulse, a neuron would reach its neighbour and turn it into light. The wave of flashes was propagating through the neural tissue, consuming and annihilating it. Soon, Poll found himself alone in the dark. The darkness surrounded him, filled his eye sockets and mouth, squeezed his chest. Poll couldn't breath, couldn't think and the only thing he felt was absolute, total terror&hellip;
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Poll woke up screaming. His dreams had turned for the worse that week. Vivid, detailed, indistinguishable from reality, but at the same time incoherent and perplexed. Actually, it was a well-known symptom, one of those that were featured prominently in the sermons of street preachers from doomsday cults. Poll was in a state of denial for a month, but his condition had become too obvious to ignore. He typed &ldquo;neurointerface autoinduction
syndrome&rdquo; in his favourite search engine and in a short time found a specialized clinic nearby. He registered on its site and booked an appointment that evening.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Poll went to work on foot. Private vehicles were forbidden in the City, and he didn't want to suffocate in overcrowded carriages. But the streets were far from deserted either. The buzzing of the crowd was complemented by the screaming ads running on huge screens which were profusely hanged above the pavement. Poll noticed painfully familiar logo on one of the screens, and a pleasant female voice informed him that &ldquo;Subregional Programming Contest will be held in the City in less than a week. Make sure you're registered!&rdquo;</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Poll had entered a high-rise building and went up to floor 70. The floor housed the jury of the contest mentioned in the advertisement, and Poll was the chairman of the jury. Several people were sitting behind their desktops in a big room. Most of them were using neurointerfaces, so no clacking of keyboards could be heard. Those people were Poll's hand-picked team, they were preparing the problems for the contest. All of them were professionally licensed problemsetters with a rank of 3 or higher. Nevertheless, Poll always verified and approved every problem by himself before a contest. He trusted his team, but the stakes were high &mdash; and a second pair of eyes couldn't hurt.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Poll went to his office, got connected to the internal network via his neurointerface and plunged into the work. The day passed by. Poll noticed that it got dark outside only when headlights of a fire helicopter flying by his window illuminated the room. He looked at his watch, and realized that he was late for the doctor's appointment. He logged off and hurried to the clinic.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">A nice nurse greeted Poll at the reception and directed him to the doctor Wasat's office. Dr. Wasat turned out to be a friendly, sympathetic aged physician, who could easily gain the confidence of his patients. He listened carefully and immediately went to the heart of the problem. After some consideration, he suggested for Poll to undergo brain scanning immediately, to confirm or deny any issues with the neurointerface. Poll felt relieved that his case had been in the hands of a specialist, and he agreed to the procedure. They went to the neighbouring room, where there was a sophisticated device resembling an electric chair. Poll sat down on it. The doctor fixed his head between two hemispheres and stepped away to the control panel. Poll saw nothing but a plain white wall in front of him. He sensed that something was connected to his neurointerface.
<br>
&ldquo;Don't resist it,&rdquo; the doctor said gently.
<br>
Poll relaxed. The device hummed to life, sending warm waves through Poll's body. Nothing happened for a while, but then suddenly Poll noticed thin sharp spikes extending from the white wall. They were slowly growing, coming closer and closer to him. All of them were aimed at his heart. He tried to break free, to dodge, but to no avail. Thousands of white spikes penetrated his chest, pierced his heart, and started to pump bright white light into him. The light displaced blood in his arteries, reached all corners of his body, flooded his mouth, poured out of his eyes. Poll shut his eyes tight and violently writhed.
<br>
&ldquo;Poll! Poll! Calm down! It's OK, it's over now!&rdquo; the doctor's voice sounded concerned.
<br>
Poll opened his eyes. Doctor Wasat was holding his shoulders and watching him closely. There were neither spikes nor light around.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">A nurse took Poll back to the office and brought him hot tea. He was sitting there alone for a long time, until doctor Wasat finally returned. The doctor was gloomy. He sat behind his desk and categorically stated:
<br>
&ldquo;I don't want to scare you, but your condition is very serious indeed. I'm sure you understand it too. It'll get worse. You'll experience visions not only when you're sleeping, but when you're awake too. To be precise, you won't be able to distinguish dreams and reality.&rdquo;</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">They talked for a couple of hours. The doctor promised to help in any way possible, but he couldn't guarantee anything. Modern medical science still wasn't able to treat such conditions.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Poll left the clinic very depressed. The doctor suggested to lift him home in a medical helicopter, but Poll declined. He didn't want to go home. He went straight to the local council building, which was the tallest in the neighbourhood. Although its roof was off-limits to the public, Poll happened to know the access code. He climbed the roof, walked up to the edge, and breathed the cool night air. He could see the City up to the horizon. Not the twisted city from his dreams, but the usual bustling city of real people. The Reality. With all its flaws, Poll didn't want to get detached from it. Better to be dead than to end up in a straitjacket inside an asylum.
<br>
&ldquo;Gonna jump?&rdquo; A female voice from behind caught Poll by surprise.
<br>
Poll turned back. A girl, mid-20's, was sitting on an air duct. She grinned and looked down at him.
<br>
&ldquo;Don't know,&rdquo; said Poll with a smile.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The girl jumped off the duct and walked up to Poll. She stepped on the edge near him and looked down in awe.
<br>
&ldquo;So high&hellip; I'm Alhena. You?&rdquo;
<br>
&ldquo;Poll.&rdquo;
<br>
They were standing shoulder to shoulder for a few minutes. Poll started to feel a little self-conscious. Alhena broke the silence first:
<br>
&ldquo;So, Poll. Gonna invite me for a date? But not tonight,&rdquo; she added hastily.
<br>
&ldquo;All right, how about tomorrow?&rdquo; Poll replied captivatedly.
<br>
&ldquo;That'd be great.&rdquo;
<br>
They exchanged their numbers and went down to the street together. Poll tried to follow her, but soon lost her in the crowd.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Next morning Poll was late for work. When he finally arrived, he found his old friend Castor waiting for him in the office. They had been arranging contests together for a long time. But Castor wasn't a problemsetter. From a young age he was passionate about protection of everything. He was responsible for physical and information security
of the contests. People called him &ldquo;Castor-hound&rdquo; behind his back, but Poll liked him. Maybe because Castor helped Poll deal with several delicate situations and difficult people, earning his deep trust and respect.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">From time to time, Castor came to each employee to personally update the access codes through the neurointerface. The employees called this &ldquo;Castor eating our brains.&rdquo; And when the codes weren't updated for some time, someone always asked &ldquo;When will Castor eat our brains again?&rdquo;</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Today was the day. Castor got connected to Poll's neurointerface and while the codes were being uploaded, they chatted randomly. When Castor left, Poll was feeling much better. A chat with a friend calmed him down and he was ready to get into gear.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">He worked hard all day. In the evening he called Alhena and invited her for dinner. They went to the best restaurant in the neighbourhood. Alhena turned out to be very sociable, able to find common ground even with such an extreme introvert as Poll. They talked about a range of things, and Poll felt he really got to know her. The only thing that troubled him was that he couldn't figure out what she was doing on the roof, and he didn't know how to ask.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">After the restaurant they went to her place. She lived alone in a small, tidy apartment. Poll settled on a couch while Alhena poured out two glasses of wine. They toasted the evening and sipped a little.

Her whole body was shaking with convulsions and she tumbled down to the floor.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">In a moment, mayhem broke out in the apartment. The main door was pulled out, windows were broken, and a dozen of armed men wearing masks and body armor poured inside. Four of them grabbed Alhena and dragged her away. Two were holding Poll down tight. But Poll didn't even try to struggle, he was dumbfounded by the unexpected twist of the story.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">A man in the same body armor but without a mask entered the room. Poll, to his utter surprise, recognized his buddy Castor. Castor sat down opposite Poll and grinned. By then, the initial shock was wearing off, and Poll burst out on him:
<br>
&ldquo;Castor, what the hell? What's going on here?&rdquo;
<br>
&ldquo;Me saving your ass again is going on here,&rdquo; said Castor favorably and in a commanding voice ordered, &ldquo;Release him.&rdquo;
<br>
The two let Poll off and stepped out. Poll rubbed his left shoulder and asked, frowning:
<br>
&ldquo;What's up with Alhena?&rdquo;
<br>
&ldquo;She was smashed by the virus I planted into your head today.&rdquo;
<br>
&ldquo;I don't understand.&rdquo;
<br>
&ldquo;It's really easy,&rdquo; said Castor, making himself comfortable. &ldquo;As
a matter of fact, you're not ill. They somehow managed to hack your brain and infect it with a virus which made you believe you've got a syndrome. Besides, the virus allowed them to make a copy of your memory via the neurointerface without you even noticing it. She just tried to do this very thing. She tried to download your today's memories, memories of all the problems you worked on. But she didn't know that I erased their virus from your system and planted mine. I call it Castor-hound,&rdquo; and he winked at Poll. &ldquo;Whenever someone tries to connect to the backdoor
in your head, Castor-hound starts to eat his brain. You saw the result.&rdquo;
<br>
Poll started to connect the dots.
<br>
&ldquo;And doctor Wasat&hellip;&rdquo;
<br>
&ldquo;&hellip; is not a doctor at all. You were his first and last patient. He downloaded a good chunk of information from your head, all the work you did this month. We eventually captured him, but it was too late, he already sold the data. There is no way we can stop the leak now. I'm afraid the contest should be canceled.&rdquo;</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Poll was fuming. He was tricked like a big silly. He stared at Castor and said categorically:
<br>
&ldquo;No, we won't cancel the contest. We'll prepare new problems.&rdquo;
<br>
&ldquo;Do you have enough time? How many problems can you prepare simultaneously?&rdquo;
<br>
That was a good question. The contest rules state that every problem should be prepared by two persons exactly: one should write a statement, the other one should prepare a set of tests. Generally, professional problemsetters have license for only one of the tasks, but some of them can do both. Besides, to eliminate a possibility of conflicts between the problemsetters working on the same problem, the difference of their ranks should be equal to 2.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">They had not much time left, so each of them could prepare only one problem.

in or out is through the checkpoint. You can bring as many faryuks as you want
to the plantation, but it is strictly forbidden to take them out. This fruit
has a very strong aroma, and the automatic aroma sensor at the checkpoint will
raise an alarm if the aroma of faryuks is detected. Fortunately, you know that
there is an error in the aroma-detecting software. Because of the use of
one-byte variables, it does not raise an alarm if the total aroma strength of
all the faryuks being taken out is an integer divisible by 256.

sprayed upon with the deodorant, its aroma strength decreases by 25 percent.
When a faryuk is scented, its aroma strength increases by 10 percent. (In both
cases, the aroma strength can become fractional). The amount of each of the
substances you have is enough for treating only one faryuk. A faryuk can be
treated first with one substance and then with the other. The effects of the
deodorant and of the scent are short. After you take a faryuk through the
checkpoint, its aroma strength restores to the initial value.

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Tsyfirkin's new student Feofan is much more intelligent and bright than Mitrofanushka. In the first three lessons, he has learned to add positive integers in columns, not very quickly but without mistakes. For this he uses the following algorithm.

<ol>
<li>Feofan adds numbers from right to left: first he adds units, then tens, and so on.
<li>He takes the pair of digit in each successive column and adds them.
<li>If a 1 is carried from the previous column, Feofan adds it to the obtained sum.
<li>He writes the rightmost digit of the sum in the answer line and, if necessary, makes a mark about carrying 1 to the next column.
<li>If there are no more columns and there is a 1 carried from the leftmost column, then Feofan writes 1 on the left of the answer.
</ol>

Feofan needs one second to write one digit or to make a mark about carrying a 1. If at least one of summands is 0 or 1, then Feofan spends one second adding them; if both numbers are greater than 1, then he adds them in two seconds. However, having added two numbers, Feofan remembers the result and can recall it afterwards in one second. If he needs to calculate <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> and he has calculated <i>b</i> + <i>a</i> before, then he also can use the result obtained earlier. Unfortunately, Feofan does not remember all the results at the next lesson and has to calculate and remember them anew.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">For example, Feofan adds the numbers 526 and 625 in 12 seconds: he spends four seconds for writing the digits of the answer, two seconds for making marks about carrying over, two seconds for calculating each of the sums 6 + 5 and 2 + 2, and one second for calculating each of the sums 4 + 1 and 5 + 6 (since he remembers from the previous calculations that 6 + 5 = 11).

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Figure-skater Lev is preparing for his fifth Olympic Games. Together with his coach he is inventing a new free skating program, which will win the judges' hearts and guarantee Lev a gold medal if he performs it without mistakes.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Lev practices twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. His wife is a well-known producer, and she wants to convert the time spent by her husband for practicing into money. She has signed a contract with the advertising agency “You See—You Buy,” which will shoot her husband at his training and make a cosmetics commercial with the use of this material.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">So, <i>n</i> cameramen have come to Lev's training. They plan to shoot Lev performing his free skating program: the first cameraman will start the shooting, the second will continue, and so on. Each of the cameramen wants Lev to skate along a segment of a straight line from some point to another (and each has specified his own pair of points). Lev has decided to skate along all the specified segments passing from a segment to a segment along a circular arc so that his trajectory has the shape of a smooth curve. If there is no arc connecting two consecutive directed segments without breaks, Lev can extend one of the segments so as to connect them by an arc.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Lev has plotted a smooth curve passing through all the segments in the specified order, and now he is interested in finding the minimum time needed for skating along this curve. He knows that he cannot skate at a speed greater than 10 m/s or with a tangential acceleration greater than 1 m/s<sup>2</sup> in magnitude (a tangential acceleration is the acceleration directed along the trajectory). Moreover, Lev cannot skate along circular arcs with a centripetal acceleration greater than 1 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Recall that a centripetal acceleration is calculated as <i>v</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>R</i>, where <i>v</i> is the speed and <i>R</i> is the radius of the arc.

*******InputConstraints*******

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The first line contains the integer <i>n</i> (1 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 1000). In the <i>i</i>-th of the following <i>n</i> lines you are given the coordinates of the beginning and of the end of the directed segment of a straight line specified by the <i>i</i>-th operator. The coordinates are integers and do not exceed 1000 in absolute value. No two consecutive segments are parallel and co-oriented. It is guaranteed that Lev can plot a smooth curve passing through all the segments.
</DIV></DIV>

*******OutputConstraints*******

<DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Output the minimum time (in seconds) Lev needs to skate along the smooth curve passing through the segments specified by the cameramen. Lev must start moving at the beginning of the first segment and finish at the end of the <i>n</i>-th segment. Lev's speed at the starting and finishing moments is zero. You must output the time with an absolute or relative error of at most 10<sup>−6</sup>.
