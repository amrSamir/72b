<P>Most of us at one time or another have used a circular combination lock (think back to those glorious days in high school and your gym locker). Most combination locks consist of a dial with the numbers 0 through <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> - 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> printed on it in clockwise order. The dial can be turned either clockwise or counterclockwise, bringing one of the numbers to the top of the dial (if 0 is at the top of the dial, a turn of 1 in the counterclockwise direction would bring 1 to the top). Each lock has a three number code <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and can only be opened after the following series of steps:<P><OL><LI>The lock dial must first be spun clockwise at least one full rotation, ending with the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> at the top (with no intervening counterclockwise turns). Note this could be accomplished with consecutive clockwise turns. </LI><LI>The lock must be turned counterclockwise until the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> appears at the top for the second time.

<P>Anna Graham is a puzzle maker who prides herself in the quality and complexity of her work. She makes puzzles of all kinds - crosswords, logic problems, acrostics, and word search puzzles, to name but a few. For each puzzle, she has developed a set of rules which she constrains herself to follow. For word search puzzles, she insists not only that all the words be connected to one another (as in most word search puzzles), but also that removing any word from the word list will not cause one or more words to become disconnected from the rest. (Two words are connected if they contain a common letter in the grid.) The example word search puzzle on the left satisfies this condition, but the one on the right does not (removing the word Pascal from the word list disconnects Java from the other two words).<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="163" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/39/p3968.png ALT="\epsfbox{p3968.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>Your job is to write a program that checks to see if Anna's word search problems are up to snuff.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Input will consist of multiple test cases.

<P>IBM has decided that all messages sent to and from teams competing in the ACM programming contest should be encoded. They have decided that instead of sending the letters of a message, they will transmit their remainders relative to some secret keys which are four, two-digit integers that are pairwise relatively prime. For example, consider the message ``<TT>THE CAT IN THE HAT</TT>". The letters of this message are first converted into numeric equivalents, where <TT>A</TT>=01, <TT>B</TT>=02, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <TT>Z</TT>=26 and a <SPAN CLASS="textit">blank</SPAN>=27. Each group of 3 letters is then combined to create a 6 digit number. (If the last group does not contain 3 letters it is padded on the right with blanks and then transformed into a 6 digit number.) For example<P><P><BR><TT>THE CAT IN THE HAT</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/39/3969img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> <TT>200805 270301 202709 142720 080527 080120</TT><P><P><BR>Each six-digit integer is then encoded by replacing it with the remainders modulo the secret keys as follows: Each remainder should be padded with leading 0's, if necessary, to make it two digits long. After this, the remainders are concatenated together and then any leading 0's are removed. For example, if the secret keys are 34, 81, 65, and 43, then the first integer 200805 would have remainders 1, 6, 20 and 38. Following the rules above, these combine to get the encoding 1062038. The entire sample message above would be encoded as<P><P><BR><TT>1062038 1043103 1473907 22794503 15135731 16114011</TT><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of multiple test cases.

<P>There are many forms of contests where the contestants (shooters) try to hit targets, either moving or still. In this version there are a number of small balloons sitting on the tops of poles that are in turn stuck in the ground at various points in a large field. These poles are not all the same height. The shooter circles the field and fires at the balloons, the goal being to burst all the balloons with as few shots as possible. Since the balloons offer almost no resistance to a bullet, the bullet will pass right through and possibly hit one or more other balloons. So, by judiciously taking shots, the shooter might need only a very few shots to hit all the targets (provided the shooter is a good marksman, which we will assume is the case).<P>For example, the following field of 10 targets can be covered in only four shots, as shown. (The first two numbers at each position indicate the position of the balloon, and the third number the height.)<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="361" HEIGHT="217" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/39/p3970.png ALT="\epsfbox{p3970.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>Your job is to determine the fewest number of shots necessary to hit all the targets in a given field.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>There will be multiple test cases.

However, temperatures have been high lately, and the floes are showing cracks, and they get damaged further by the force needed to jump to another floe. Fortunately the penguins are real experts on cracking ice floes, and know exactly how many times a penguin can jump off each floe before it disintegrates and disappears.

The containers are piled up as they arrive. Then the huge cargo ships arrive, each one capable of carrying thousands of containers. The containers are loaded into the ships that will bring them to far away shores. Or the other way round, containers are brought in over sea, piled up, and transported to the hinterland one by one. Anyway, a huge parking lot is needed, to store the containers waiting for further transportation.</p><p>Building the new container terminal at the mouth of the river was a good choice. But there are disadvantages as well. The ground is very muddy, and building on firm ground would have been substantially cheaper. It will be important to build the parking lot not larger than necessary.</p><p>A container is 40 feet long and 8 feet wide. Containers are stacked, but a stack will be at most five containers high. The stacks are organized in rows. Next to a container stack, and between two container stacks (along the long side of the containers) a space of 2 feet is needed for catching the containers. Next to a row of stacks, and between two stacks (along the short side of the containers) a space of 4 feet is needed for the crane that lifts the containers. All containers are placed in the same direction, as the cranes can not make turns on the parking lot.</p><p>The parking lot should be rectangular. Given the required capacity of the parking lot, what will be the best dimension for the parking lot? In the first place the area should be minimal. The second condition is that the parking lot should be as square as possible.</p><p>Below you see a plan for a parking lot with a capacity of 8 stacks. Two rows of four containers each turns out to be the best solution here, with a total area of 92 &times; 42 = 3864.</p><p><center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/39/p3973.jpg><br/> A parking lot with 8 container stacks.</center></p><h2>Input</h2>On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100.

Therefore they decide to take the route that will keep them as far away from any enemy base as possible.</p><p>Being well prepared for the mission, they have a detailed map of the area which marks all (known) enemy bases, their current position and the rendezvouz point. For simplicity, we view the the map as a rectangular grid with integer coordinates (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) where 0 &le; <em>x</em> &lt; <em>X</em>, 0 &le; <em>y</em> &lt; <em>Y</em>. Furthermore, we approximate movements as horizontal and vertical steps on this grid, so we use Manhattan distance: dist((<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>y</em><sub>1</sub>),(<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>y</em><sub>2</sub>)) = |<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>-<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>|+|<em>y</em><sub>2</sub>-<em>y</em><sub>1</sub>| and also the commandos can only travel in vertical and horizontal directions at each step.</p><p>Can you help them find the best route? Of course, in case that there are multiple routes that keep the same minimum distance to enemy bases, the commandos want to take a shortest route that does so. Furthermore, they don't want to take a route off their map as it could take them in unknown, dangerous areas, but you don't have to worry about unknown enemy bases off the map.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100.

First and foremost, one should of course take every possible measure to make sure that the trip is uneventful and that no incidents occur. But even then, one should always be prepared for the worst and try to make sure that if an incident does happen, people's chances of surviving are as high as possible.</p><p>When making an emergency landing over water, the distance to the nearest land is a critical factor. In general, the further out on open waters, the worse are the odds of survival. Thus, one important safety parameter of a flight is how far away from the nearest land that any part of the flight will take you. Your job is to write a program which, given a flight route, will determine this distance.</p>To simplify matters, we model the world as a 2-dimensional plane rather than a sphere. We model continents as polygons, and a flight route as a sequence of key points connected by straight line segments. Flight routes always start and end strictly inside a continent, but intermediate key points may be located over water.

Part of your job is to determine what the summits in a particular landscape are. Unfortunately, it is not so easy to determine which points are summits and which are not, because we do not want to call a small hump a summit. For example look at the landscape given by the sample input.</p><p>We call the points of height 3 summits, since there are no higher points. But although the points of height 2, which are to the left of the summit of height 3, are all higher than or equal to their immediate neighbours, we do not want to call them summits, because we can reach a higher point from them without going to low (the summits of height 3). In contrast, we do want to call the area of height 2 on the right a summit, since if we would want to walk to the summit of height 3, we first have to descend to a point with height 0.</p><p>After the above example, we introduce the concept of a <em>d</em>-summit. A point, with height <em>h</em>, is a <em>d</em>-summit if and only if it is impossible to reach a higher point without going through an area with height smaller than or equal to <em>h</em>-<em>d</em>.</p><p>The problem is, given a rectangular grid of integer heights and an integer <em>d</em>, to find the number of <em>d</em>-summits.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100.

The concept is simple: you drive your car into the elevator at the entrance of the tower, and the elevator and conveyor belts drag the car to an empty parking spot, where the car remains until you pick it up. When you return, the elevator and conveyor belts move your car back to the entrance and you're done.</p><p>The layout of the tower is simple. There is one central elevator that transports the cars between the different floors. On each floor there is one giant circular conveyor belt on which the cars stand. This belt can move in clockwise and counterclockwise direction. When the elevator arrives on a floor, it becomes part of the belt so that cars can move through it.</p><p>At the end of the day the tower is usually packed with cars and a lot of people come to pick them up. Customers are processed in a first come first serve order: the elevator is moved to the floor of the first car, the conveyor belt moves the car on the elevator, the elevator is moved down again, and so on. We like to know how long it takes before the last customer gets his car. Moving the elevator one floor up- or downwards takes 10 seconds and moving a conveyor belt one car in either direction takes 5 seconds.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100.

This number is -1 if the position is empty, and <em>r</em> if the position is occupied by the <em>r</em>th car to pick up. The positive numbers form a consecutive sequence from 1 to the number of cars. The entrance is on the first floor and the elevator (which is initially empty) is in the first position.

<h1>Problem D - Jumping Hero</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>A software house has decided to create a computer game, where the hero must find its 
way from a start position to the end position, through a labyrinth. In the labyrinth, 
some cells contain magic fountains that can be used to get super-powers an infinite 
number of times. Whenever the hero enters a cell with a magic fountain, he gets 
super-powers.
<p> 
Usually, our hero moves in the labyrinth one cell left/right/up/down at a time (to an 
empty cell). With super-powers, the hero jumps to an empty cell N positions to the 
left/right/up/down. The super-power lasts for M jumps, and the hero can change its 
jumping direction after each jump. A jump is allowed if the end cell of the jump is 
within the map and it is not a wall â thus, the hero can jump over walls. If the hero 
jumps to a cell with a new magic fountain, the hero gets the super-powers of the new 
magic fountain, and the remaining effect of the previous magic fountain is cancelled. 
If the hero jumps to the cell where he obtained its current super-powers, no effect 
occurs (i.e., the hero gets no additional super-powers). When the current super-power 
ends, the hero proceeds its normal one-cell movement. If, after getting super-powers 
in some fountain, the hero cannot move to any cell, he looses his super-powers and 
returns to his previous cell. To reach the end position, the hero must move to the end cell or finish one jump in the end cell. <h2>Problem</h2>Given the labyrinth map compute the minimum number of moves/jumps from the 
start position to the end position. <h2>Input</h2>Input consists of multiple test cases the first line of the input contains the number of test cases. There is a blank line before each dataset. The first line of each dataset contains two positive integers, L and C, separated by a 
empty space, with L the number of lines and C the number of columns in the map. 
L and C are both lesser than 300. The following L lines of the input contain C 
integers each that define the cells of the map (separated by a empty space). Each 
integer, i, must be interpreted as follows: i = 0 represents a wall; i = 1 represents an empty cell (where the hero can move into); i = M*10+N represents an empty cell with a magic fountain that makes the hero jump M times to the cell that is N positions to 
the left/right/up/down of the current cell. M ranges from 1 to 5 and N ranges from 2 
to 6. The maximum number of magic fountains in a map is 5,000. 
The two last lines of the input define the coordinates of the start position and end 
position (coordinates consist of two integers, denoting the line and column 
respectively, starting from 0). 
<h2>Output</h2>The output consists of one single line that contains an integer with the minimum 
number of moves/jumps, from the start position to the end position. If it is impossible 
to reach the end position, the output should be a single line containing <tt>IMPOSSIBLE</tt>. Print a blank line between datasets.<h2>Sample Input</h2><pre>1

For example, it is possible that one dish can be accomplished either using a fridge (using 30 minutes of the fridgeÕs time) or a freezer (using only 5 minutes).

<body><h1 style="text-align: center;">Problem A -- Toy Cube<br></h1><p>My kid loves to play with this toy cube. The cube consists of 6 faces, each of them divided into a 3x3 grid (9 cells). Each cell is painted one of the six possible colors (RGBYWO). My kid loves his cube a lot, but he has lost it. He is asleep now and I want to surprise him by giving him back a cube that is identical to his own. Two cubes are said to be identical if the second one can be rotated to exactly resemble the first when viewed from any angle. Having said that, the trouble now is that I have a cube that might not really be identical to his. But before he wakes up, I want to repaint some of the cells of the cube to match his own. Can you tell me the minimal number of cells I need to repaint?</p><p><b>Input Format</b>:<br>The first line contains the number of testcases.<br>Each test case consists of two cube descriptions, one followed by the other.<br>Each cube description consists of exactly 10 lines; the 10 th line is empty.<br>The first three lines describe the TOP face, the next three describing the faces in LEFT, FRONT, RIGHT, BACK face order, and the next three lines describe the BOTTOM face. The cube is described as if the outer paper was cut and rolled out. If you stick the leftmost column of the LEFT face with the rightmost column of the RIGHT face, and stick the topmost row of the TOP face with the bottom-most row of the BOTTOM face, you get the cube. Follow the sample input for more clarity.<br></p><p><b>Output Format</b>:<br>For each test case, print "Case #&lt;case-number&gt;:" (sans quotes) followed by the minimal number of cells to be repainted to match the two cubes.</p><p><b>Sample Input</b>:<br></p><pre>2<img title="First sample input illustration"

<div class="p"></div>The various departments of Swamp County College are working on their instructor schedules for the upcoming semester. As part of this planning process, the college administrators want to make sure that the instructor assignments for class days and times are spread equitably among the faculty. The college has the instructor and course section data for the past several semesters, and the administrators want to be able to query this information to see which instructors have taught on given days or times.<div class="p"></div>The past course section data are in a file named <i>sections.csv</i> with one course section per line. Each line consists of a number of fields, with the field values separated from each other by commas. The fields appear in the following order:<div class="p"></div><dl><dd><br /><i>Term:</i> A string consisting of "Fall" or "Sprng" followed by a single space and the four-digit year<div class="p"></div><i>Class Num:</i> The number of the course, an unsigned integer in the range 1-99999<div class="p"></div><i>Class Section Cd:</i> The section number for this class, an unsigned integer in the range 1-99999<div class="p"></div><i>Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun:</i> Days when the class meets (Y or N for each day of the week)<div class="p"></div><i>Meeting Time Start:</i> Time of day when the class starts, as hh:mm AM/PM<div class="p"></div><i>Meeting Time End:</i> Time of day when the class ends, as hh:mm AM/PM<div class="p"></div><i>Instructor ID:</i> Instructor's employee ID (nine digit unsigned integer, may include leading zeroes)<div class="p"></div><br /></dd></dl>It is possible for the same class to have multiple instructors assigned. Each instructor receives credit for teaching during the specified times. Instructors do not teach multiple classes concurrently, nor do any instructor class times overlap-there are therefore no duplicate entries in the <i>sections.csv</i> file.<div class="p"></div>Your team has been asked to write a utility that administrators can use to query this data. Each query will appear on a separate line of not more than 80 columns. Elements within a query are separated from each other by one or more spaces. Queries contain three parts: a function, a range limit, and a day/time range specification.<div class="p"></div>The function will be "LIST" (list the IDs of the instructors that meet the selection criteria) or "COUNT" (count the instructors that meet the selection criteria). Any requested list is to be produced in ascending instructor ID order.<div class="p"></div>The limit will be "ANY", "ALL", or an inequality character ( &lt; or &gt; ) immediately followed by a percentage. "ANY" means that the instructor is selected if any of the time he or she spent teaching (in any term) falls in the desired range. "ALL" means that the instructor is selected if all the time he or she spent teaching in all terms falls in the desired range. A less than or greater than sign followed by a percentage means that the instructor is selected if less (or more) than the specified percentage of the instructor's total time spent teaching in all terms falls in the desired range.<div class="p"></div>The day/time range specification will contain a day list, a time specification, or both. A day list begins with the word "ON", followed by an optional "NOT" and one or more days of the week in any order. The days of the week are represented by their three letter abbreviations: "MON", "TUE", "WED", "THU", "FRI", "SAT", and "SUN". The selection criteria then include (or exclude, if "NOT" is specified) the given days of the week. No weekday will appear more than once in a given query.<div class="p"></div>The time specification will contain the word "BEFORE" or "AFTER" followed by a time (hh:mm) followed by "AM" or "PM". The selection criteria then include all time spent teaching before or after the specified time (inclusive). Note that a "NOT" in the query only affects the day list, not the time specification.<div class="p"></div>Here are descriptions of the queries in the sample input:<div class="p"></div><dl><dd><br /><tt>LIST ANY ON SAT</tt><div class="p"></div>List the instructors who taught at any time on Saturday.<div class="p"></div><br /><tt>COUNT ALL ON NOT FRI SAT SUN</tt><div class="p"></div>Count the number of instructors who did not teach at any time on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.<div class="p"></div><br /><tt>LIST &#62;75% ON TUE THU&nbsp;&nbsp;AFTER 7:00 PM</tt><div class="p"></div>List the instructors who taught 75% or more of their total teaching time on Tuesdays and/or Thursdays at 7 PM or later.<div class="p"></div><br /><tt>COUNT ALL BEFORE 11:30 AM</tt><div class="p"></div>Count the number of instructors whose classes always finished no later than 11:30 AM.<div class="p"></div><br /><tt>LIST ALL ON SUN</tt><div class="p"></div>List the instructors who only taught on Sunday.<div class="p"></div><br /></dd></dl>A sample <i>sections.csv</i> file is available with the "getdata" command. <i>sections.csv</i> will be available to your submission in your execution current working directory.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
                          With the explosion of Internet access and commerce over the past
decade, there has been a huge demand for organization domain names.
Several words are often strung together to form a second-level domain
name (the name to the left of the top-level .edu, .com, .org,
<font face="symbol">¼</font
> domain).  Names are limited to 63 characters, and although
hyphens are allowed, most domain name owners avoid them so the names
are shorter and easier to type.  However, since domain names are
case-insensitive, alternate readings of such names are sometimes
possible, and there have been occasional cases where an alternate
reading was embarassing for the domain owner.  This has happened even
when the name was not initially seen as a word sequence strung
together.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Your team has been commissioned to develop a program that will take
suggested domain names and compare them against the words in a
dictionary.  The program is to determine if a domain name can be
split entirely into words that exist in the dictionary, and make
particular note if such a split includes "questionable" words.  The
potential domain owner can then decide if (s)he wants to change the
name, perhaps by inserting hyphens at desired points or even
rewording the name entirely.  Note that a domain owner is interested in every
possible word split, regardless of whether or not the result makes
sense as a phrase.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Input to your program will be in two sections.  The first section
contains the word dictionary, one word per line.  
Any word that is considered "questionable" 
will be listed with a question mark in the first column.  Words that are not
questionable will have a space in the first column.
Each word in the dictionary will
appear in lower case (letters a-z) starting in
the second column.  Variations of a word (such
as "run," "runs," and "runner") will be listed separately.  
Words will each be unique and will appear in no
particular order.  No word is longer than 32 characters.  The word
list could contain up to 20,000 words.  The dictionary will end with
an empty line.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The remaining input will be a list of proposed second-level domain
names in all lower case, one per line, each starting in the first
column.  This list will end with the end-of-file.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For each proposed second-level domain name, your program is to print
a list of all the possible word sequences that make up the domain
name.  The proposed name should appear on a line
by itself, starting in the first column, immediately followed by a
colon.  The word sequences should appear in alphabetical (ASCII)
order, one per line.  If a given word sequence contains a
questionable word, the first column is to contain a question mark; if
no word in the sequence is questionable, the first column is to
contain a space.  The word sequence is to be printed starting in the
second column, with hyphens separating the words from each other.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If a given domain name cannot be split into a sequence of dictionary
words, print an exclamation mark in the first column, followed by the
message "No word sequence found." starting in the second column.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
No output line is to include trailing whitespace.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Print an empty line after the results for each domain name (including
the last).

<div class="p"></div>Swamp County has historically poor transportation infrastructure, and many residents lack automobiles. Public transportation serving Swamp County is incomplete and often inconvenient. As a result, citizens have been forced to improvise unique combinations of transportation to get where they need to go. Locals call this off-beat tradition "Swamp Trompin'."<div class="p"></div>For example, the daily routine of one inventive resident consists of: biking from home to the edge of nearby Lake Swampy, standing on a log and poling across the shallow lake, hiking to the bus stop on Bog Street and waiting for the Route 32 bus, riding that bus to the Crayfish Avenue stop, waiting there for the Dragonfly Trolley, riding the trolley to the Broken Oak Street stop, cutting through the Broken Oak Bait and Feed shopping mall, roller-blading from the mall parking lot across the traffic intersection crosswalk at Weeping Willow Lane, and finally arriving at work with eight minutes to spare.<div class="p"></div>Given an origin, a destination, a needed arrival time, and a list of available route segments, your team is to develop a program that will find a route that allows the traveler to start at the latest possible time and still reach the destination by the needed arrival time.<div class="p"></div>Input to your program will begin with three lines containing the name of the origin, the name of the destination, and the needed arrival time in that order. Each of these values will begin in the first column and will not contain trailing whitespace.<div class="p"></div>The remaining input will be a list of route segments. Each route segment consists of an action description, a start point name, end point name, an integer traversal time in minutes, and an availability specification that describes the times at which that segment may be used. The availability specification consists a start time and end time (both inclusive), and an integer number of minutes indicating the interval between possible departures. All fields are separated by commas. All times are written as HH:MM in a 24-hour format. For example, if a bus's availability is "09:00,12:00,40" that means that the bus departs the segment starting point at 09:00, 09:40, 10:20, 11:00, and 11:40. An interval value of 1 is used for all pedestrian segments to indicate that the traveler may start walking at any minute of the day. The input will contain between 1 and 100 route segments and is terminated by end-of-file. Route segments may appear in any order.<div class="p"></div>You may assume that the traveler has enough money to pay for any fares, and that he or she carries any equipment needed for any route segment (e.g., a bicycle) and can use it without delay (e.g., no time is needed to put on roller-blades). The shortest duration needed to traverse any segment is 1 minute. The traveler may wait at any location for any number of minutes. Buses and other public transportation always run on time, are never full, and follow the same schedule every day. All traveling takes place between the hours of 6 AM and noon. Availability specifications may cover any time of day, but times do not span midnight.<div class="p"></div>Your program should print step-by-step directions giving the start time of each action, as shown in the sample output. Times are to be printed in the same format as used in the input. Waiting time is implied-do not print waiting time in the directions. The last step should be the time of arrival at the destination. If there is no way for the traveler to begin at 6 AM or later and reach the destination by the needed arrival time, your program should print "Just stay home". If there are multiple routes that require the traveler to begin at the same time, print the route that reaches the destination soonest. If there are multiple routes that start and end at the same times, print any one of them.<br><div class="p"></div><table align="center" border="0"><tr><td><i>Sample Input</i></td></tr></table><tt><br />&nbsp;Home<br>&nbsp;Work<br>&nbsp;10:00<br>&nbsp;Bike,Home,Lake Swampy East Shore,15,00:00,23:59,1<br>&nbsp;Push a log,Lake Swampy East Shore,Lake Swampy West Shore,6,00:00,11:59,1<br>&nbsp;Push a log,Lake Swampy West Shore,Lake Swampy East Shore,8,00:00,11:59,1<br>&nbsp;Hike,Lake Swampy West Shore,Bog Street,19,00:00,23:59,1<br>&nbsp;Ride Route 32 Bus,Gater Gully,Bog Street,15,06:30,18:15,20<br>&nbsp;Ride Route 32 Bus,Bog Street,Crayfish Avenue,10,06:45,18:15,20<br>&nbsp;Ride Dragonfly Trolley,Crayfish Avenue,Broken Oak Street,12,08:00,18:00,30<br>&nbsp;Ride Dragonfly Trolley,Broken Oak Street,Motorsport arena,23,08:12,17:12,30<br>&nbsp;Mall Walk,Broken Oak Street,Parking lot,5,09:00,18:00,1<br>&nbsp;Roller-blade across crosswalk,Parking lot,Weeping Willow Lane,1,00:00,23:59,2<br>&nbsp;Walk,Weeping Willow Lane,Work,3,00:00,23:59,1<br>&nbsp;Hike,Home,Work,240,00:00,23:59,1<br>&nbsp;Roller-blade,Home,Work,300,00:00,23:59,1<br></tt><br /><br /><table align="center" border="0"><tr><td><i>Output for the Sample Input</i></td></tr></table><tt><br />&nbsp;08:25 Bike from Home to Lake Swampy East Shore<br>&nbsp;08:40 Push a log from Lake Swampy East Shore to Lake Swampy West Shore<br>&nbsp;08:46 Hike from Lake Swampy West Shore to Bog Street<br>&nbsp;09:05 Ride Route 32 Bus from Bog Street to Crayfish Avenue<br>&nbsp;09:30 Ride Dragonfly Trolley from Crayfish Avenue to Broken Oak Street<br>&nbsp;09:42 Mall Walk from Broken Oak Street to Parking lot<br>&nbsp;09:48 Roller-blade across crosswalk from Parking lot to Weeping Willow Lane<br>&nbsp;09:49 Walk from Weeping Willow Lane to Work<br>&nbsp;09:52 Arrive at Work<br></tt><div class="p"></div><div class="p"></div></font>

The player distributes pebbles across the board so that: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>At most one pebble resides in any given square. 
</LI>
<LI>No two pebbles are placed on adjacent squares. Two squares are considered adjacent if they are horizontal, vertical, or even diagonal neighbors. There's no board wrap, so 44 and 61 of row three aren't neighbors. Neither are 33 and 75 nor 55 and 92.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The goal is to maximize the number of points claimed by your placement of pebbles. 

<P>
Write a program that reads in a sequence of boards from an input file and prints to stdout the maximum number of points attainable by an optimal pebble placement for each.

<P>A ``<SPAN CLASS="textit">letter</SPAN>" lock is a circle, in which we mark some positions equidistant from one another. The positions are numbered clockwise by a zero-based index and there is exactly one English capital letter put in each position. The state of the lock is given by a string, which contains all letters enumerated from position 0 to the end. The lock can change its state by performing rotations: After a rotation, every letter in the circle will move clockwise to the next position. If the lock received a password in form of a string, it will step by step rotate to change its state and verify whether its current state matches the prefix of the password. Whenever it matches, the lock will be unlocked, and the verification process will stop successfully. If the lock moves around and there has been no matched state found, it will delete the first character in the password and retry with the new password, and so on. This process repeats until the lock is unlocked or the password has b! een completely deleted (verification fails).<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="492" HEIGHT="226" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/40/p4002.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4002.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>Given a sequence of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> locks, in which the state of any lock is not shorter than the state of its previous lock, one may want to unlock all of them in succession by only one password.

<P>A local school has noticed an increasing number of cases where electronic essays submitted by students are very similar. The teachers come up with an effective method to automatically detect similar documents using <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-grams as the building block. An <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-gram is a sequence of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> consecutive words. Two <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-grams are considered equal if their contents are exactly the same (case sensitive).<P>A word is a sequence of consecutive characters delimited by one or more whitespaces, punctuations or boundaries of email addresses. A whitespace can take the following ASCII codes: 9 (horizontal tab), 10 (new line), 11 (vertical tab), 12 (new page), 13 (carriage return) or 32 (space). A punctuation character can be any character with the following ASCII codes: 33 (exclamation mark), 44 (comma), 46 (period), 58 (colon), 59 (semicolon) and 63 (question mark). But when the period is part of an email address, the whole email address is considered to be a word.<P>An email address has the format: <SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="textbf">local-part@domain-part</SPAN></SPAN>. Both the local part and the domain part may only contain the following ASCII characters:<P><UL><LI>Uppercase and lowercase letters </LI><LI>The digits 0 through 9 </LI><LI>The characters with ASCII codes 45(-) or 95 (_) </LI><LI>The period (.) provided that it is not the first nor the last character in the local part or the domain part, nor may it appear two or more times consecutively. </LI></UL><P>Additionally, the domain part must contain at least one period and an email address is the longest string of characters satisfying the above-mentioned conditions.<P><P><BR>For example, the following document:<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit">Email address</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="textit">Email address:</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN ID="txt53">admin.team@company.com.vn</SPAN></SPAN>.<P><P><BR>has three unique 2-grams namely:<P><P><BR>``<SPAN CLASS="textit">Email address</SPAN>", ``<SPAN CLASS="textit">address Email</SPAN>" and ``<SPAN CLASS="textit">address <SPAN ID="txt56">admin.team@company.com.vn</SPAN></SPAN>".<P><P><BR>Notice that this document has only one email address, which is <SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN ID="txt57">admin.team@company.com.vn</SPAN></SPAN>, and its substring <SPAN ID="txt80"><SPAN CLASS="textit">team@company.com</SPAN></SPAN> is not a valid email address.<P>For a given value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, suppose document <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> has <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> unique <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-grams, document <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> has <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>l</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> unique <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-grams and the two documents have <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> unique <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-grams in common.

<P>One of the scientific research projects was almost chosen to the shortlist of the Ig Nobel. It was rejected because the author stated that the analyzed data is not sufficient, and that it will be studied further in the future. The research is to investigate the shape of ink drops left by grade 1 students in their notebooks. The author chose a point in the ink drop to act as the center. A line starting from that point rotates 360<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUP>o</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>; and whenever it hits an angle of 360<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUP>o</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>/<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the intersection of the line and the border of the drop will be marked. At the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th mark, we get the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th intersection ( <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> = 1, 2,..., <I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>). Thus, after the <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>n</I> - 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th is the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th, and after the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th is the 1-st one.

One of the research goals is to find a rain drop which has a shape closest to that of the ink drop.

Nancy is the best babysitter of the block and today she faces her greater challenge: little John and his anxious box of markers. But Nancy has prepared herself for this eventuality with an activity that it will maintain occupied little John. In a paper sheet with squares John will have to put his blue marker in some corner of a square and at the order of ``right" (or left, or up, or down) he will have to be draw a segment that unites the present position with next point to its right (or left, or up, or down); the marker will be placed in that last point hoping the following instruction. 

<P>
The idea is that John follows the instructions, draws a simple polygon and counts the number of squares that are within the figure. Remember that the boundary of a simple polygon does not cross itself.

Being in charge of the computer department of the Agency of International Espionage, you are asked to write a program that will allow a spy to decode their messages. 

<P>
You can assume a spy's message is at most 400 characters long, and it includes all the uppercase letters of the English alphabet plus the space, any digit, and any of the following characters: <TT>! , . : ; ? -</TT>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The algorithm that the department will use to encode all their messages will be following: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>They first encode the message with a simple code key. This simple code key is a one for one character substitution based upon a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">single arithmetic manipulation</SPAN> of the printable portion of the ASCII character set (0-126). This single arithmetic manipulation is the same for each character of the message. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>After, they agree secretly on two numbers that will be used as the number of rows (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>) and columns (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>) in a matrix. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The department then enters the letters of the message encode in spiral pattern along the matrix. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
For example, if the message is: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<TT>-CDC IS THE TRADEMARK OF THE CONTROL DATA CORPORATION.</TT> 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
and there <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I> = 9</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I> = 6</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the department would write down. 

<P>

<P>Lawliet is a very intelligent person, he is often seen solving puzzles or painting beautiful landscapes, in his new challenge he is trying to make some art with dominoes, he will draw a figure on a rectangular grid consisting of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1&#215;1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> squares by marking some of these squares, after that he will try to cover the marked squares with dominoes. As you probably know dominoes consist of pieces of size <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2&#215;1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, for simplicity we assume that the dominoes can only be put horizontally or vertically and that you have an unlimited amount of dominoes available. The cover has to be perfect, meaning that the dominoes must cover only the marked positions and the dominoes must cover all of them, also all the dominoes must lie strictly inside the rectangular grid.

<P>It is said that the people of Menggol lived in caves. A tribe's caves were connected to each other with paths. The paths were so designed that there was one and only one path to each cave. So the caves and the paths formed a tree. There was a main cave, which connected the world outside. The Menggolian always carved a map of the tribe's caves on the wall of the main cave.<P>Scientists have just discovered Menggolian's tribe. What a heart-stirring discovery! They are eager to explore it. Since the terrain is very complex and dangerous, they decide to send out a robot.<P>The robot will be landed into the main cave, where he will begin his adventure.

<P>David comes to Chengdu for ACM-ICPC 2007. After learning Chengdu is a beautiful city, David decides to buy his friends some gifts.<P>The capacity of David's pocket is so small that it can only contain <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> gifts. Considering the diversity of his gifts, David would not buy two of the same kind. And some typical gift should be chosen to represent the features of Chengdu.<P>David will walk down from north to south and visit <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> shops one by one along the shopping street. There is <SPAN CLASS="textit">ONLY ONE</SPAN> type of gift sold in each shop.<P>David has such a poor memory that he can't remember how many shops sell gift <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. So he will write a number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> on this gift he bought in his pocket, to indicate how many shops where sell gift <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. In David's opinion, the smaller the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is, the better the gift (David like uncommon gifts).<P>When David stops in a shop which sells gift <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the following three situations he might come across.<P><OL><LI>If there is not gift <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> in his pocket and still some place for it, He will buy without hesitation.

But which gift should be discarded? According to the follow rule:<P>He chooses the gift that has the biggest number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> on it. If several gifts have the same biggest number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, he will discard the one which has been putted into the pocket at the earliest time. After discarding the gift, he will put gift <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> into his pocket and write number `1' on gift <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. </LI></OL><P><P><BR>Now, your task is to write a program to record the number of these gifts which have been discarded by David.<P><P><BR>For example:<P>David's pocket has the capacity only for two gifts. There are 5 shops in the street, and each shop sells only one type of gift. The selling sequence of gifts is 1, 2, 1, 3, and 1.<P>In shop 1, the pocket is empty, so he will buy gift 1, write a number `1' on this gift, and then put it into his pocket.<P>When he comes to shop 2, there is one place left in his pocket, so he buys gift 2, write a number `1' on it, and then put it into the pocket.<P>When walking into shop 3, he has already got gift 1 in his pocket, so he will replace the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> (here, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I> = 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I> + 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.<P>When David visits shop 4, the pocket is full, but without gift 3 in it, so he has to discard one gift to release a place for gift 3. The number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> on gift 1 is `2', but the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> on gift 2 is `1', so he will discard gift 1, write number 1 on gift 3 and then put it into the pocket.<P>In shop 5, the pocket is full, gift 1 is not in it, he should will discard a gift to find place for gift 1. The number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> on gift 2 is `1', the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> on gift 3 is also `1'. They have the same <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, but gift 2 put into the pocket earlier than gift 3. So he discards gift 2, write number `1' on gift 1 and then put it into the pocket. At the end of the street, David gets two gifts in his pocket, number `1' on gift 3 and number `1' on gift 1.

A teleport machine - a special kind of machine capable of moving objects from one place to another instantaneously, without passing through the intervening space - has just been invented. Out of curiosity, you went to the laboratory and asked if you could have a try. Although even the engineers who have designed this machine can't control where the object entering the machine will end up, they have told you the way the teleport machine operates:

<P>
In the interior of the teleport machine you may find a special structure (as illustrated above). There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> cylinders of possibly different integer heights, and a special (yet unknown to you) value had been assigned to each of them in the following way:

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the values assigned to them are recorded in the array <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>value</I>[]</SPAN>

You have to enter two integers, the distance which you want to move the object, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th largest value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> among all <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> cylinders' values. A serious malfunction will occur unless the numbers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> are entered correctly. (It is easy to see that if we follow the process described above strictly, it takes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>O</I>(<I>N</I><SUP>3</SUP>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> time to calculate all values; that is why the engineers can only use short-distance teleportation so far; however you wonder whether there exists a way to evaluate the function effectively so as to use the long-range transfer ability of this machine.) 

<P>
Now you have to figure out what the value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is, given the heights of all cylinders of the teleport machine and the distance you need to move the object. For example you find the machine has 5 cylinders, and the distance you want to move the object is 2. Their heights are 2 1 2 1 3 so your calculations (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>value</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>) are 2 0 2 0 2. After that the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> which you should enter the second largest <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>value</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is 2.

The total mileage of highways stretches to nearly 80,000 km, ranking at the forefront in China. Now a highway network with the provincial capital of Chengdu as the center radiating to all cities in the province has been formed. A total of 500 km of expressways have been built. It is very easy to transfer passengers and freights between Sichuan and other provinces. After a nationwide railway speed acceleration launched in last year, trains can be allowed to run at a speed above 120 km per hour. However, the average speed of a train depends on its make-up. There is only single railway track between stations from Baoji to Chengdu, A primary task for dispatchers is to arrange for trains to meet and pass each other. You are requested to write a program to make the arrangement for a series of trains of different speeds from one station to its next station in the least amount of time.<P>What you should pay attention to while writing this program is that since there is a single railway track from Baoji to Chengdu, two trains are not allowed to pass the same spot at the same time, or they would be collision, and that because of the limited staff, there should be a fixed interval time between two trains out of the station, what's more, the trains could pull into the station at the same time, but never get out at the same time.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of several test cases.

One of the key elements to hold a successful programming contest is maximizing the overall satisfaction degree of all participating teams. Although a team's satisfaction degree is influenced by many factors -- for example, whether this competition is well-organized, and sometimes the weather condition of the place where the competition is held - but among those factors, what usually influences a team's satisfaction degree most is the team's performance in the contest. 

<P>
Since the performance factor is a matter which the organizing committee cannot control, ask you to simply estimate the overall satisfaction degree of all teams. In particular, through years of experience, the committee asks you to calculate the satisfaction degree of a team using the following estimation steps: 

<P>

<OL>
<LI>If this team has performed in the contest at least as well as it had expected, its satisfaction degree is 3; otherwise 
</LI>
<LI>If this team's performance is better than its last year's performance, its satisfaction degree is 2; otherwise its satisfaction degree is 1. 
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
(For the sake of simplicity, both the performance of a team and a team's expectation are measured by its place on the rank list.) 

<P>
This year's and last year's rank lists, along with the expectations of all teams are already given to you. (But the method which we used to find the expectations of the participating teams will remain a secret!) Can you calculate the total satisfaction degree of all teams by the above rules and the data you've been given?

<P>
There are some water, milk and wine in your kitchen. Your naughty little sister made some strange drinks by mixing them together, and then adds some sugar! She wants to know whether they taste good, but she doesn't want to try them herself. She needs your help. 

<P>
Your sister knows that you don't want to drink them either (anyone wants to?), so she gives you a chance to escape: if you can guess the price of a special drink, she gives you freedom. Warning: she loves her special drink so much that you should never under-estimate its cost! That is, you're to find the most expensive possible price of it. 

<P>
The price of each drink equals to its cost. If the amounts of water, milk, wine and sugar used in the drink are <!-- MATH

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, in any drink.

Sadly, you don't know the exact price of anything (you're a programmer, not a housewife!), but you know that water is the cheapest; wine is the most expensive, i.e., <!-- MATH

<P>Suppose you have an ice hockey ball (Which has the shape of a cylinder as shown in the figure) and a photo frame (a rectangle). You place the ball in one corner of the photo frame and keep the balls position and orientation fixed. Now you start rotating the frame in clockwise direction. But as the sides of the frame and of the ball have high friction so while the frame is rotating its surface and the balls surface never slips.

Laura Luo has just invented a game. Given a beautiful pencil sketch with n points, you're to colorize it with water pens by painting circuits. Each time you paint a new circuit, starts with one point, follow some line segments and return to the starting point. Every point can be reached more than once, but every segment can be painted at most once. To make the picture look interesting, different segments must be painted different colors. For each segment, Laura has already decided a direction to paint it. The picture below illustrates a possible way to paint the picture (dashed lines are segments that are not painted).

<P>Miss Kitty graduated from University N that has a long history of training their students to become teachers in an island country T. All of her classmates, including Miss Kitty, work very hard at school to become teachers of primary or secondary schools. However, due to the extremely low birth rate in island T, there is little demand for teachers in the island T. Miss Kitty has changed her career plan after unable to secure a stable job in the teaching market after more than 5 years of struggling. She wants to acquire other practical skills by entering graduate schools. However, the tuition for higher education in island T is very high. She needs to save money before becoming a student again.

According to the trusted source, scientists have found several evidences of creature's existence on a newly found planet, called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Uggla</SPAN>. These evidences are distributed on <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> locations in a <!-- MATH
 $1000 \times 1000$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1000&#215;1000</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> square area, and the location coordinate of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th evidence is <!-- MATH
 $(x_{i} ,y_{i})$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>i</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>i</SUB>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. It is of our great interests to further analyze all of them so that we can have better understanding of the creatures on <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Uggla</SPAN>. 

<P>
The Interplanetary Creature Protection Council (ICPC) has decided to initiate a mission for the exploration of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Uggla</SPAN>. More specifically, the ICPC plans to launch a space shuttle to collect the evidences found on <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Uggla</SPAN>. However, for safety reason, the space shuttle will not land on <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Uggla</SPAN>, but it will launch one mobile robot to collect information of the evidences instead. Since the mobile robot is un-recyclable (i.e., they can only be landed once), it will report the space shuttle its collected data using wireless communications. 

<P>
Unfortunately, after the launch of the space shuttle, a serious design fault of the mobile robot is also reported. That is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">the mobile robot can only move straightly, but can not make a turn</SPAN>. Since the space shuttle only carries one robot, being the captain of the space shuttle, it is now your responsibility to plan a route (i.e., where to land the robot and which direction the robot should move forward) such that the robot can visit as many locations as possible. Note that, each distinct route is a set of evidence's locations, regardless of the order of the location coordinates and the landing location of the mobile robot.

<P>A tree is drawn on a grid as in Fig. 1. The tree has trunks, trunks have branches, and branches have leaves. Let the tree always grow from the origin (0,0). A trunk, branch, or leaf can grow in 8 different directions. So, a tree has maximum 8 trunks, a trunk has maximum 8 branches, and a branch has maximum 8 leafs. There are joints between trunks, branches, and leaves.<P>The length of a trunk, branch, and leaf is 8,4, and 2 respectively. The weight of a trunk, branch, and leaf is equal to its length. The tree grows on a grid. Each grid has length equal to 1 and its diagonal length is treated as 1 as well. So in Fig. 1, trunk 1 looks longer than trunk 2 but they are of the same length.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="572" HEIGHT="610" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/40/p4038.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4038.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>Suppose a new leaf must grow from joint 2-1 in the direction marked by the double arrow. This new leaf will collide with leaf 1-1-1, forcing leaf 1-1-1 to do something. First, joint 1-1 can rotate all its leaves by 45 degree clockwise or counterclockwise. The correct answer in this case is to rotate the joint by 45 degree counterclockwise and then the new leaf has room to grow. However, if joint 1-1 has full 8 leaves, no matter how joint 1-1 is rotated, the new leaf can not grow. In this case, joint 1 should be rotated. The origin is a joint too. However, rotating it is meaningless.<P><P><BR><B>Notes:</B><UL><LI>A rotation that overlaps leaves with its parent branch or branches with their parent trunk is not a valid solution.

There are several historic sites in Tainan city, some of which are connected by shopping streets. For convenience, we can view the historic sites and streets as a graph such that historic sites are represented by nodes and streets are represented by edges. The edges have nonnegative weights representing distance or time. Yuan-Ling would like to traverse all the streets, starting and ending at historic site ``Tainan Main Station". Your task is to help Yuan-Ling seek a closed walk that minimizes the total weight (the sum of the edges' weights in the walk) such that all the streets are traversed at least once. We call such a walk as a minimum closed walk. A walk is a list <!-- MATH

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I><SUB>0</SUB>, <I>e</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>v</I><SUB>1</SUB>,..., <I>e</I><SUB>k</SUB>, <I>v</I><SUB>k</SUB></SPAN>

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Note that a walk may repeat nodes and edges. A walk is closed if its end-nodes are the same.

Given a graph <!-- MATH
 $G = (V, E)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I> = (<I>V</I>, <I>E</I>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, we use <!-- MATH

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> to represent the nodes. Each edge <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>u</I>, <I>v</I>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is associated with the weight <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I>(<I>u</I>, <I>v</I>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> that is a positive integer. Your task is to write a computer program to compute the weight of a minimum closed walk that traverses all the edges at least once.

<P>The Fun-To-Play company is designing a maze to train a robot. The maze has several check points, each with 3 doors labeled as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The robot has to choose a door to continue his journey. Some of the check points have a hidden door which will only show up when the battery of the robot runs out. There is no hint for which door leads to which check point and some of the doors may lead back to the same check point. The robot will keep moving until the battery runs out. If the robot stops at a check point with the hidden door when the battery runs out, the robot gets a credit. Assume that the time needed for a robot to choose a door and move on to a check point is always the same, and, for simplicity sake, can be considered as one time unit. Also assume that the battery can run for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> time units. Your mission is to find the number of different ways for the robot to get credits with the given maze and battery life.<P>The maze may be modeled by a finite state machine <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

It first evaluates (1, 2) (1, 3) <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to get (2, 3), and then evaluates (2, 3) (2, 1) <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to get (2, 4). Therefore the value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> in this example is (2, 4) and the product of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is 8.<P>Now let's make things a bit complicated. Given a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> of length <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>n</I> - 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, let each <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> be a variable. To simplify the description, let's rewrite <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> as a permutation of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>n</I> - 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> integers, where each positive integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> between 1 and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> appears exactly once and denotes operand <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and the integer 0 appears <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> - 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> times and denotes an operator. Each operand <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> has a set of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>k</I><SUB>i</SUB><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/40/4042img1.png ALT="$ \ge$">1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> ordered pairs of positive integers to choose from, and each operator has the two operator types <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to choose from. As a result, by fixing a choice for each of the operands and operators in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, we can get an expression and its corresponding product. This problem asks you to find the minimum product among all possible expressions.<P>Here is an example problem instance. Suppose <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> = 2</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I> =</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> 2 1 0, and operands 1 and 2 are associated with <SPAN CLASS="MATH">{(1, 2),(2, 1)}</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">{(1, 3)}</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, respectively. There are a total of 4 possible expressions: <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(1, 3)(1, 2)<I>X</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(1, 3)(1, 2)<I>Y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(1, 3)(2, 1)<I>X</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(1, 3)(2, 1)<I>Y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

<P>Frank is a portfolio manager of a closed-end fund for <SPAN CLASS="textit">Advanced Commercial Markets</SPAN> (ACM ). Fund collects money (cash) from individual investors for a certain period of time and invests cash into various securities in accordance with fund's investment strategy. At the end of the period all assets are sold out and cash is distributed among individual investors of the fund proportionally to their share of original investment.<P>Frank manages equity fund that invests money into stock market. His strategy is explained below.<P>Frank's fund has collected <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> US Dollars (USD) from individual investors to manage them for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> days. Management is performed on a day by day basis. Frank has selected <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> stocks to invest into. Depending on the overall price range and availability of each stock, a <SPAN CLASS="textit">lot size</SPAN> was chosen for each stock -- the number of shares of the stock Frank can buy or sell per day without affecting the market too much by his trades. So, if the price of the stock is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> USD per share and the lot size of the corresponding stock is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, then Frank can spend <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>i</SUB><I>s</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> USD to buy one lot of the corresponding stock for his fund if the fund has enough cash left, thus decreasing available cash in the fund. This trade is completely performed in one day.<P>When price of the stock changes to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p'</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> later, then Frank can sell this lot for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p'</I><SUB>i</SUB><I>s</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> USD, thus increasing available cash for further trading. This trade is also completely performed in one day. All lots of stocks that are held by the fund must be sold by the end of the fund's period, so that at the end (like at the beginning) the fund is holding only cash.<P>Each stock has its own volatility and risks, so to minimize the overall risk of the fund, for each stock there is the maximum number of lots <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> that can be held by the fund at any given day. There is also the overall limit <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> on the number of lots of all stocks that the fund can hold at any given day.<P>Any trade to buy or sell one lot of stock completely occupies Frank's day, and thus he can perform at most one such trade per day. Frank is not allowed to buy partial lots if there is not enough cash in the fund for a whole lot at the time of purchase.<P>Now, when fund's period has ended, Frank wants to know what is the maximum profit he could have made with this strategy having known the prices of each stock in advance. Your task is to write a program to find it out.<P>It is assumed that there is a single price for each stock for each day that Frank could have bought or sold shares of the stock at. Any overheads such as fees and commissions are ignored, and thus cash spent to buy or gained on a sell of one lot of stock is exactly equal to its price on this day multiplied by the number of shares in a lot.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Input consists on several datasets.

<P>A group of contestants sits at the round table and plays the following game to relieve anxiety before the start of NEERC 2007. The game is played with a single token that is given to one person at the beginning of the game. This person passes the token to the adjacent person on the left-hand side or to the adjacent person on the right-hand side with a certain probability. A person who receives the token does the same with his own probability and so on. The game ends when each person has received the token at least once. The last person who has received the token wins.<P>The problem is to find the probability of winning for the given person.

The ``Hanoi Towers" puzzle consists of three pegs (that we will name <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>) with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> disks of different diameters stacked onto the pegs. Initially all disks are stacked onto peg <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> with the smallest disk at the top and the largest one at the bottom, so that they form a conical shape on peg <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

<P>
A valid move in the puzzle is moving one disk from the top of one (source) peg to the top of the other (destination) peg, with a constraint that a disk can be placed only onto an empty destination peg or onto a disk of a larger diameter. We denote a move with two capital letters - the first letter denotes the source disk, and the second letter denotes the destination disk. For example, <TT>AB</TT> is a move from disk <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> to disk <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. 

<P>
The puzzle is considered solved when all the disks are stacked onto either peg <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (with pegs <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> empty) or onto peg <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (with pegs <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> empty). We will solve this puzzle with the following algorithm. 

<P>
All six potential moves in the game (<TT>AB</TT>, <TT>AC</TT>, <TT>BA</TT>, <TT>BC</TT>, <TT>CA</TT>, and <TT>CB</TT>) are arranged into a list. The order of moves in this list defines our strategy. We always make the first valid move from this list with an additional constraint that we never move the same disk twice in a row. 

<P>
It can be proven that this algorithm always solves the puzzle. Your problem is to find the number of moves it takes for this algorithm to solve the puzzle using a given strategy.

<P>Internationalization and localization are long words that are usually abbreviated as i18n and l10n. The numbers in between i-n and l-n refer to the number of letters that were omitted. It is a very powerful abbreviation method that can be naturally used for any words.<P>A word may be abbreviated only when it has previously occurred in a given text. A word is abbreviated by omitting all the letters in the word except for the first and last letter and replacing omitted letters with a number of omitted letters.<P>Your task is to write a program that expands such abbreviations in a given text whenever possible. Expansion is possible if it is <SPAN CLASS="textit">valid</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="textit">unambiguous</SPAN>.<P>Expansion is valid if expanded word has previously occurred in the text and its abbreviated form corresponds to the abbreviation that is being expanded. Case is ignored for the purposes of validness. For example, expansion from i18n to internationalization is valid in this problem statement (even as internationalization was previously mentioned only with capital letter I). But expansion of p14n to parameterization is not valid since the word parameterization has never occurred before its abbreviation, and expansion of a11n to abbreviation is not valid, since it is not a correct abbreviation for the word abbreviation (correct one is a10n).<P>Expansion is unambiguous if there is exactly one valid expansion for it. For example, expansion from l10n to localization is unambiguous in this problem statement, but expansion from p5m cannot be made unambiguously, since both problem and program are abbreviated to p5m.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Input consists on several datasets separated by a blank line.

<P>
Michael had visited ACM ICPC World Finals 2007 in Tokyo, Japan and became fascinated with Japanese writing. He decided to study hieroglyphs, but in order to check his knowledge he needs a piece of software that can verify correctness of his writing. This program takes a description of a correct shape of the hieroglyph, several Michael's attempts to write it, and judges each attempt as correct or incorrect. 

<P>
In this problem hieroglyphs are represented as a collection of strokes, each stroke being a straight line on a Cartesian plane. The order of strokes is irrelevant for the hieroglyph shape, but the direction of each stroke is relevant. There are eight relevant directions: straight right, upper-right, straight up, upper-left, straight left, lower-left, straight down, and lower-right. 

<P>
Two writings are considered to represent the same shape if one-to-one correspondence can be established between the strokes and all the endpoints of the strokes, so that direction of strokes and relative positions of pairs of points are preserved. Preservation of relative positions is important for any pair of points, even if they are not connected with a stroke. However, relative positions are important only with respect to eight relevant directions described above. 

<P>
For example, here is a hieroglyph similar to Latin letter A with 5 endpoints connected with 3 strokes and several other correct writings of the same shape:

<P>Deterministic Final-State Automaton (DFA) is a directed multigraph whose vertices are called <SPAN CLASS="textit">states</SPAN> and edges are called <SPAN CLASS="textit">transitions</SPAN>. Each DFA transition is labeled with a single letter. Moreover, for each state <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and each letter <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>l</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> there is at most one transition that leaves <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and is labeled with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>l</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. DFA has a single <SPAN CLASS="textit">starting</SPAN> state and a subset of <SPAN CLASS="textit">final states</SPAN>. DFA defines a language of all words that can be constructed by writing down the letters on a path from the starting state to some final state.<P>Given a language with a finite set of words it is always possible to construct a DFA that defines this language. The picture on the left shows such DFA for the language cosisting of three words: <TT>fix</TT>, <TT>foo</TT>, <TT>ox</TT>. However, this DFA has 7 states, which is not optimal. The DFA on the right defines the same language with just 5 states.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="661" HEIGHT="177" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/40/p4054.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4054.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>Your task is to find the minimum number of states in a DFA that defines the given language.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Input consists of several datasets.

As all puzzles are initially available in a box in a solved format and a (3×N) puzzle can have zillions of solutions for larger values of N. All the puzzles from ACM factory will have only some specific solutions when sold; they will be unique and only small fractions of all possible solutions. So it is more likely that the counterfeit products wont have these orientations. You have to help them in the initial part: given the value of N you will have to find how many different solutions are there with the given pieces. You are not allowed to rotate the pieces while solving the puzzle but you can use any piece any number of time. Of course some of the pieces are mere rotation of another but they also cannot be rotated to make it look like the other. For example the piece with shape upside down T (the brown piece) cannot be rotated to look like a normal T (the pink piece).</p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><table class=MsoTableGrid border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 style='border-collapse:collapse;border:none;mso-border-alt:solid windowtext .5pt;

The topic of this competition is The Nature of Bangladesh. But their idea is little bit unusual. For each photographer, the organizer will provide a set of tickets of different prices and in a particular order, to travel and take pictures from various locations around <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bangladesh</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Photographers can travel from one place to another if the price of the ticket is same as the traveling cost between these two places. All the invited photographers have to collect these tickets from <st1:place w:st="on">Dhaka</st1:place> and will start their journey from there. The participants may choose any route to the final destination - Coxs Bazar where the final event is to be held. To make this tour simple (or complicated<span style='font-family:Wingdings;

During their tour the photographers must use all the tickets in the order as they are given. The photographers can also travel to any place more than once but they have to reach at Coxs Bazar using the final ticket. Otherwise, they will be disqualified from the competition. Now the organizing committee wants to know the number of places (including <st1:place w:st="on">Dhaka</st1:place> and Coxs Bazar) it is possible for the participants to visit during their tour.

The girls of course cannot go out of the ellipse, the ellipses cannot intersect and the poor boy stuck at the center.

As fuel price have gone high and nations have shut down their nuclear plants so the price of electricity/battery is also sky high.

For simplicity you can assume that a station is denoted by a point in a two dimensional Cartesian Coordinate system. But these triangular tracks and ticket pricing policy can create new troubles. As the ticket price between two stations is proportional to the square of the distance, people often avoid the shortest route to destination and rather choose the longer one through another station. This causes more electricity expense per passenger and creates unwanted crowd in the stations.

Prime numbers are defined as follows: a number is prime if it is greater than 1 and is evenly divisible only by itself and 1. Note that by definition neither zero nor one is a prime number. 

<P>
A palindromic number is one whose string representation is a palindrome, that is, a string that reads the same backwards and forwards. 

<P>
You are on the clue crew preparing questions for the category ``Palindromic Primes" and are to write a program to generate the answer and responding question in Jeopardy! style.

The input file contains a series of number pairs (with white space separating them) specifying individual problems, ending with a pair of zeroes. The first number gives the number of digits for the numbers to be considered, the second number gives the base in which the numbers are to be generated. The numbers are separated by a single space. You are assured that all palindromic primes for this problem can be represented in the range of a standard 32-bit signed integer. The bases allowed are integer bases between 2 and 36 â with bases above base ten handled as extensions of hexadecimal. This means that the valid numeric digits are in the range [`<TT>0</TT>'..`<TT>9</TT>'] and [`<TT>a</TT>'..`<TT>z</TT>'].

<P>
You are a secret agent for the Eternally Indebted External Intelligence Office (EIEIO) of the country of Nomoneo. Headquarters has disguised your one-time pad for encrypted communications in the form of a Rubik's Cube<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUP>(R)</SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. (For those of you unfamiliar with the puzzle, a Rubik's Cube<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUP>(R)</SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> comes in the form of a cube where each face is divided into three rows and three columns (nine ``squares"). Any of the six faces of the cube may be rotated either clockwise or counterclockwise, which also rotates the three nearest squares on each adjoining face onto a new face, respectively. When solved (or taken from the factory packaging), each face of the cube contains squares of only one color. There is no way to change the relationship between the colors of the central squares on each face.) The cube has been pre-scrambled and you are to apply a certain set of moves to the cube based on the message you want to return.

<P>
This diagram provides the relationship between the sides of the cube as well as the orientation of the faces for the purposes of input and output. It should be viewed as an unfolded cube with the text on the outside. The faces are indicated by the color of the central subdivision (square) and are White, Orange, Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow. The corner with the dot is the top left corner for purposes of input and output.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2> 

<P>
Your program should read the input data from the file, which consists of several cases. The first line of the input will give the number of these input cases (as a decimal integer without any punctuation), which will be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10,000. Each case consists of three lines giving the initial state of the puzzle cube and one line giving the rotations you must apply to reach the appropriate final state of the cube. 

<P>
Each of the three lines giving the initial state of the cube consists of 18 letters with a single space between each pair of letters. There is no space between the last letter and the end of the line. Each of the letters is `<TT>W</TT>', `<TT>O</TT>', `<TT>R</TT>', `<TT>B</TT>', `<TT>G</TT>', or `<TT>Y</TT>' indicating the respective color. The faces are listed from left to right in the order (by central square color) White, Orange, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow. Thus, the first three columns of letters give the state of the ``White" face, and so forth. The fourth line of the case gives the manipulations that you must apply to the cube. Each manipulation consists of a single letter as above (`<TT>W</TT>', `<TT>O</TT>', `<TT>R</TT>', `<TT>B</TT>', `<TT>G</TT>', or `<TT>Y</TT>') indicating which face (selected by the color of the center) you should rotate. Each rotation thus indicated is a 90<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUP><TT>o</TT></SUP></SPAN>

<P>
Print to standard output the state of the cube after the indicated manipulations. Use the same format as for input: three lines, each containing 18 color letters separated by a single space character. Do not put a space after the final letter on the line. Print out the faces in the same order, left to right, as for input: White, Orange, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow. After each output case, print a line containing 35 `<TT>=</TT>' characters.

<P>Geek Challenge [SKRZAT] is an <SPAN CLASS="textbf">old</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="textbf">old</SPAN> game from Poland that uses a game console with two buttons plus a joy stick. As is true to its name, the game communicates in binary, so that one button represents a zero and the other a one. Even more true to its name, the game chooses to communicate so that the base of the number system is <SPAN CLASS="textbf">minus two</SPAN>, not plus two, so we'll call this representation ``Weird Binary". Thus the bit positions label the powers of <SPAN CLASS="textbf">minus two</SPAN>, as seen in the following five-bit tables:<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=8 BORDER FRAME=BOX

Philip J. Frog just wanted to go for a mid-afternoon swim, but in typical frog fashion he's ended up in the middle of a busy street. Help Phil figure out how long he'll be hopping on hot asphalt before he finds his way to the nice cool water. 

<P>
Phil may hop one square horizontally or vertically per second. He may only hop onto road, grass, or water. Additionally, he cannot occupy any square occupied by a car. Phil and the cars move at the same time, meaning Phil can ``hop over" an oncoming car. Phil can also remain in the same square if he wishes. All horizontal movement wraps (e.g., a rightward hop from the rightmost column places Phil in the leftmost column). Cars move horizontally in the direction indicated on the map (`<SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>' means leftward, `<SPAN CLASS="MATH">&gt;</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>' means rightward) at a rate of one square per second and never collide with anything.

GamesAreUs.com has just completed its outside audit for this year. One item that was caught was the lack of any business rules for assigning permissions to files on the company's shared file server. The analysts are working on setting up some roles for all employees and what permissions should be given to each role. Your team is to take a look at the existing situation so you can provide some input to the analysts. 

<P>
Fortunately permission assignment has not been completely random. The most common way to set up a new employee is to ask that they be set up ``just like Joe", effectively making an ad-hoc prototype system. 

<P>
You will be given the access control lists (ACLs) for the top level directories of the shared file server. Using these, your team is to write a program to split the users up into equivalence classes where all members of a class have access to exactly the same directories. 

<P>
Because of the several departments in GamesAreUs.com, there are multiple access control lists to be processed: one set of lists per department.

There will be no duplicate UIDs on the line, but note the UIDs and FIDs are in separate spaces so a UID could be the same integer as a FID. The ACLs, and within an ACL the UIDs, appear in no particular order. In the full list of ACLs, a given FID will appear only once. There are at most 50 top-level directory ACLs and there are at most 100 UIDs. All FIDs and UIDs are greater than 0.

In the Price Is Right's game Cover Up, players test their luck to win a new car. To win, the player must produce the actual retail price of the car from a board of possible numbers like: 

<P>
<PRE>
        9 
      3 4
    0 4 7
  9 6 7 3
1 4 8 2 6
3 2 4 0 8
</PRE>

<P>
The player selects one number from each column to form a bid. Using the above board as an example, the first number in the price of the car is either 1 or 3; the second is one of 9, 4, 2; the third is one of 0, 6, 8, 4; and so on. Numbers may never move to a different column. 

<P>
After the player selects their bid, Drew Carey lights up the numbers in the bid which are correct. If the player has no numbers correct, the game ends and they lose; if they have at least one number correct, the game continues. 

<P>
When the game continues, the player is given another opportunity to select numbers from those columns that were incorrect. They will <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cover up</SPAN> the wrong bid numbers with different selections from the same columns. Again, Drew Carey will light up any new correct digits. If the player has no <SPAN  CLASS="textit">new</SPAN> numbers correct, the game ends and they lose; if they have at least one new number correct, the game continues. 

<P>
For example: 

<P>
<PRE>
        9              9              9 
      3 4            3 4            3 4

               c c x c x      c c x c c

               INITIAL BID    SECOND BID
</PRE>

<P>
The player selects an initial bid of $14677. The 1, 4 and first 7 are correct (<TT>c</TT> stands for correct, <TT>x</TT> for incorrect, and <TT>v</TT> designates a column that requires a subsequent selection in the example above). The player covers up the incorrect 6 and 7 with an 8 and a 3 for a second bid of $14873. The 3 is correct, but the 8 is wrong. At this point it's a 50/50 chance. The player will select the 4 or the 0 and either win the car or lose the game.

<P>
The show's sponsors would like to know how frequently their cars are given away. You are to use the assumption that players choose numbers uniformly from those remaining.

The upper and lower circles are bridged by a smaller circle, which rotates -- in the plane of the board -- 180 degrees, effectively exchanging the three bottommost marbles of the upper circle with the three uppermost marbles of the lower one.

<P>The ACM Base in Planet X is need of energy. Fortunately plenty of resources have been detected in a huge area. But the area is far from the Base. The robots must be transferred to the area to gather the resources.<P>There are two types of robots in the base: G-robot (gathering) and R-robot (repairing). In order to save energy, the robots have limited turning directions. They can only move to south or east in one step. The G-robot can gather resource. Once he has arrived at one place where there're some resources (we call it E-place), he would always gather resources in that place. After he has gathered <SPAN CLASS="textbf">ONE</SPAN> unit of resource, he would leave that place at once, move to south or east, or be transferred back to Base. The R-robot can repair the damaged bridges, so that other robot can get through.<P>In order to simplify the problem, we represent the area as a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> <TT>*</TT> <I>M</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> matrix.

After all the resource in a E-place are taken away, the ground will collapse and neither of the two robots can go acrooss.</DD></DL><P>The G-robot can gather as much energy as possible without a capacity limitation. The robots can be transferred to any place in the matrix and transferred back to Base from any pplace. But the process of transfer can fray the robots.

<P>
Fennec has applied a card from CSI-Bally Total Fitness which is a gym in
Beijing. He loves BODYPUMP best and joins in it about 3 times a week!

<P>
BODYPUMP is a weight-based group-fitness program created by Phillip Mills
and distributed globally by Les Mills International.

<P>
The first BODYPUMP class was started in December 1991 in Auckland
(according to Information published in UK via a report by Alan Felstead). The
philosophy of Phillip Mills was to involve everyone into the aerobics room.

<P>
A standard class is 60 minutes long. There is also a 45 minute class. The lately
BODYPUMP Express class, which lasting 30 minutes, has bpeen introduced to Japan.
And the class in Bally is about 50 minutes.

<P>
The classes are performed to music using free weights-plates, barbells and an
aerobic step. Participants choose their weights based on the exercise and their
personal strength levels. Major muscle groups are worked via series of compound and
isolation-based exercises including squats, presses, dead lifts, as well as other
exercises.  The focus is enhancing muscle endurance using several repetitions.
Hypertrophy occurs in all classes.

<P>
A new BODYPUMP class, consisting of new music and choreography, is
developed and released to health clubs and instructors every three months. Muscle
groups are always worked in the same order as stated in the Les Mills Instructor
Resources, allowing for consistency across releases. Instructors can choose to work
with one release, or mix tracks from multiple releases, in order to achieve maximal
gains in strength and hypertrophy for their class. Instructors and trainers are provided
with guidance from Les Mills International regarding the mixing oftracks for classes.

<P>
Music is used to guide and encourage participants. A normal class contains ten
mainstream hit songs. The music is choreographed and each track targets for a
different muscle group. The tracks consist of a warm up followed by squats, chest,
back (clean and presses, dead lifts and dead rows), triceps, biceps, lunges, shoulders
(a selection ofpush-ups, lateral raises, frontal raises and military presses), abdominals
and finally a cool down encompassing a variety of stretches.

<P>
Due to the nature of the program maximum heart rate (MHR) increases in
different phases. In addition, the aerobic capacity changes are based on music
selection beats per minute (BPM).

<P>
However, during the BODYPUMP, Fennec needs to add or remove the plates to
change the weight of his barbell to practice different parts of his muscle groups. To
make it simple, we just divide the BODYPUMP into a sequence of songs and he will
choose a weight in each song.

<P>
For example, there are three types of plates whose weights are 1-kg, 2-kg and
3-kg. And there are three songs which need the weight of8-kg, 14-kg, and 10-kg.

<P>
Fennec can choose to add two 2-kg plates in each side of his barbell for the first
song .

<P>

<P>
<BR>
<PRE>
                             22-----22
                                \o/
                                 I
                                / \
</PRE> 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Then, he can add one 3-kg plates in each side ofhis barbell for the second song.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
<PRE>
                            322-----223
                                \o/
                                 I
                                / \
</PRE> 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
At last, he can remove the 3-kg plates and add one 1-kg plate in each side ofhis
barbell.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
<PRE>
                            122-----221
                                \o/
                                 I
                                / \
</PRE> 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
After the class, Fennec should removee all the plates out of his barbell and return
them back.

<P>
Now, we can see that, during the class Fennec needs 4+2+4+6=16 moves. It is
for you now to find the way with the minimum number of moves. Please note that, the
weight at each side ofthe barbell must be the same!

In the late 1700s', Gauss, a famous mathematician, found a special kind of
numbers. These integers are all in the form:  <!-- MATH
 $a + b \sqrt{-k}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I> + <I>b</I><IMG

 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/40/4079img1.png

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>.The sum and multiplication
ofthese integers can be naturally defined as the follows:

<P>

<P>
<BR>
<!-- MATH
 $(a+b \sqrt{-k})+ (c+d \sqrt{-k}) = (a+c)+ (b+d) \sqrt{-k}$

One can prove that the sum and multiplication of these integers constitute the
structure called ``imaginary quadratic field" in calculus.

<P>
In case <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> = 1</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, these are common complex numbers.

<P>
In case both <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> are integers, these numbers are called ``Gauss integers", and
this is the very case that interests people the most in quadratic algebra.

<P>
As we all know that every integer can be factorized into the multiplication of
several primes (Fundamental theoorem of arithmetic, or unique factorization theorem).

<P>
Primes are the integers that can only be divided by 1 and itself. We do have a
similar concept in the context ofGauss integer.

<P>
If a Gauss integer cannot bee factorized into the multiplication of other Gauss
integers (0, 1, -1 exclusive), we call it a ``Gauss Prime" or ``Non-divisible".

<P>
Please note that 0, 1 and - 1 are not regarded as gauss primes but <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="41" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/40/4079img1.png
 ALT="$ \sqrt{{-k}}$"></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is.

<P>
However, unique factorization theorem doesn't apply to arbitrary <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. For example
in  the  case  <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> = 5</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>,  6  can  be  factorized  in  two  different  ways:
<!-- MATH
 $6 = 2 \ast 3, 6 = (1+\sqrt{-5}) \ast (1-\sqrt{-5})$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">6 = 2 <TT>*</TT> 3, 6 = (1 + <IMG
 WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/40/4079img1.png
 ALT="$ \sqrt{{-5}}$">) <TT>*</TT> (1 - <IMG

 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/40/4079img1.png
 ALT="$ \sqrt{{-5}}$">)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

<P>
Thanks to the advance of mathematics in the past 200 years, one can prove that
there are only 9 integers can be used as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, such that the unique factorization theorem
satisfies. These integers are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>

<P>In this world of information explosion, many websites use database to store information. WebPages are automatically generated by programs. These programs are usually written in PHP, JSP, ASP, and CGI. Webpage template and layout are also included in the programs. Information data is optionally loaded from database and is filled in the webpage at the time that the webpage is visited. The completed webpage will be displayed in the browser.<P>Automatically generated WebPages have some major differences with manually created ones.<P><OL><LI>WebPages created by the same program will have the same template. </LI><LI>Apart from the data loaded from database, WebPages created by the same program will have the same content. </LI><LI>WebPages created by the same program will have the same framework of background data. </LI></OL><P>It is desirable that the background data could be extracted from WebPages and reused. This is the so called ``Information Extraction".<P>HTML is composed of tags. HTML tags are always enclosed in angle-brackets (<TT>&lt; &gt;</TT>) and are case-insensitive.<P>Tags typically occur in begin-end pairs. These pairs are in the form<P><P><BR><!-- MATH
 $<tag>  \ldots  </tag>$
 --><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt; <I>tag</I> &gt;...&lt; /<I>tag</I> &gt;</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark><P><P><BR>where the <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt; <I>tag</I> &gt;</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> indicates the beginning of a tag-pair, and the <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt; /<I>tag</I> &gt;</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> indicates the end. (The three dots indicate an arbitrary amount of content between the tags.) The usual way to refer to each tag is ``tag" for the first and ``slash-tag" for the second, where tag is the actual name of the tag being discussed.<P>One pair of tags define a container. Any content within a container has the rules of that container applied to it. For example, the text within a ``boldface container" would be boldfaced. Similarly, paragraphs are defined using a ``paragraph container."<P>On another hand, thinking of tag-sets as containers will help you remember that tags should always be balanced. That is to say, you should keep containers nested within each other.<P>Since HTML is based on these structures, so it is often the case that the arrangement of text within a container is irrelevant. For example, within a paragraph container, all ofthe text can be in one long line, or in a series of separate lines, or with every word on its own line, or every word separated by nineteen spaces. These would all be displayed exactly the same. That is to say, whitespace doesn't matter. (Whitespace is all of the blank areas in a text file-empty lines, extra spaces, and so on.)<P>We need to first define some basic functionalities. Given a HTML webpage, such as:<P><P><BR><PRE>

<P>For years, a group of Regional Contest Directors (RCDs) of the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) have been unsatisfied with the way contest submissions get ranked. The group sees it is academically wrong to emphasize the importance of program correctness, disregarding the ``<SPAN CLASS="textit">quality</SPAN>" of the program itself. After all, programming as a profession promotes design, style, maintainability, etc. and not just correctness. The group's suggestion is to have a panel of six judges. Each judge is assigned the task of grading the submissions based on a particular aspect: 1) Correctness; 2) Robustness; 3) Overall design; 4) Clarity; 5) Coding style; and finally 6) Maintainability. The final grade of a submission would be the average of the six grades it gets.<P>The old guards of the current ICPC judging style have always responded that it is not possible to impartially judge a program on anything but correctness. How can the ICPC be certain that judging is fair? In other words, how can the ICPC be sure that non of the judges is favoring certain teams and disadvantaging others? Any hint of accusation to the judging process and ICPC loses the prestigious status it worked on for years. (Alright! So they do have a point.) Still, this hasn't stopped other domains from judging candidates based on subjective metrics. Take for example Gymnastics, or The Nobel Prizes, or even the ACM's very own Doctoral Dissertation Award. These are all highly respected awards where the winner is selected by judges using subjective metrics. ICPC could use a new judging system based on what is used in gymnastics. Rather than having each judge grade a certain aspect of the program, each of the six judges would assign an overall grade (out of ten) based on all of the six metrics mentioned above. To enforce impartiality, the final grade of a submission would be calculated as the average of all the grades after deleting two grades: The highest and the lowest. Any judge that favors a certain team (and assigns them an undeserved high grade,) risks the possibility of that grade being dismissed. Similarly, any judge that attempts to disadvantage a team by assigning them a low grade faces a similar risk.<P>Write a program to print the final grade of a submission.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your program will be tested on one or more test cases.

Ever since he was a kid, Alex was paranoid over someone laying their hands on his phone book. He decided that he must write the numbers in some secret way that only he can decipher. At first he tried quite complex algorithms, but that slowed him down when he needed to dial a number fast. He finally came up with the following algorithm: Rather than writing down the number itself, Alex would shift the number one place to the left (as if multiplying it by 10,) then adding the shifted number to the original. For example, if the phone number was 123, Alex would add 1230 to it, resulting in 1353. To make what he writes looks as a regular phone number, Alex truncates the result (from the left,) so that it has as many digits as the original phone number. In this example, Alex writes 353 instead of 123 in his phone book.<P>Alex needs a program to print the original phone number given what is written in his phone book. Alex, who by the way is a good friend of Johnny, isn't that good in arithmetic. It is quite possible that the numbers are messed up. The program should print ``<TT>IMPOSSIBLE</TT>" (without the quotes) if the original number cannot be computed.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your program will be tested on one or more test cases.

<P>Any square grid can be viewed as one or more <SPAN CLASS="textit">rings</SPAN>, one inside the other. For example, as shown in figure (a), a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">5 <TT>*</TT> 5</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> grid is made of three rings, numbered 1, 2 and 3 (from outside to inside.) A square grid of size <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is said to be sorted, if it includes the values from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> in a row-major order, as shown in figure (b) for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = 4</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. We would like to determine if a given square grid can be sorted by <SPAN CLASS="textit">only rotating its rings</SPAN>. For example, the grid in figure (c) can be sorted by rotating the first ring two places counter-clockwise, and rotating the second ring one place in the clockwise direction.<P><P><BR><IMG WIDTH="199" HEIGHT="284" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/40/p4086a.png ALT="$\textstyle \parbox{.35\textwidth}{

<P>In a letter dated December 25, 1640; the great mathematician Pierre de Fermat wrote to Marin Mersenne that he just proved that an odd prime <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is expressible as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I> = <I>a</I><SUP>2</SUP> + <I>b</I><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> if and only if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is expressible as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I> = 4<I>c</I> + 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. As usual, Fermat didn't include the proof, and as far as we know, never wrote it down. It wasn't until 100 years later that no one other than Euler proved this theorem.

Forget Facebook, forget Second Life, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">The Writers' Club</SPAN> is the next big thing on the Internet. The Writers' Club is where both writers and lovers of short stories get to meet, publish, read, and discuss the writers' promising contributions. As any other Internet virtual community, the website gives readers the facility to create a list of their favorite writers. The website maintainers have noticed that readers tend to favor writers already favored by the readers' favorite writers. For example, if John likes the stories written by Alice, then many of the readers who likes John's stories also like Alice's. Needless to say, John's readers tend to also admire Alice's favorite writers too. 

<P>
The website would like to start a recommendation service based on this observation. Continuing with the above example, the website would like to recommend Alice (and her favorite writers, and their favorite writers, and so on) to all of John's readers. Of course, the recommendation service has to be smart enough not to recommend a writer already favored by the reader receiving the recommendation.

Your program will be tested on one or more test cases. The first line of a test case specifies two positive integers: <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the total number of users (not exceeding 100, 000) and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the number of writers (not exceeding 100.) <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> line follows, one for each writer. Each line is made of one or more names, the first being the name of a writer, and the remaining being the names of admirers of that writer. For example:

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>reader</I><SUB>1</SUB>...<I>reader</I><SUB>d</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> are the names of the writer's admirers. A name is a sequence of one or more lower-case letters, no longer than 16 characters. Names are unique throughout the test case. Names are separated by one or more spaces.

Johnny is on probation! He has failed so many math courses and the Department has forced him to register in a remedial math course. He must pass the course or he'd be expelled from the University. In an attempt to impress his professor, Johnny is typing all his assignments on the computer. The latest assignment is rather simple, Johnny was given a set of problems to solve. Each problem had a list of one or more numbers that Johnny was supposed to add. Johnny has worked all night on the assignment, neatly typing his solution to each problem using a word processor as seen here: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TT>4+12+3=19</TT>

</DIV> 

<P>

<P>

As usual, Johnny woke up late, he hardly had the time to print the assignment and rush to class. Only in the classroom did he discover that, 
due to a printer driver problem, non of the plus signs were printed. The above line was printed as: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TT>4123=19</TT>

</DIV> 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Write a program to figure out where the pluses are supposed to be. All what Johnny remembers is that all the numbers were positive; None of the numbers, other than possibly the sum, had more than 5 digits; And none of the numbers had a zero as the left-most digit.

<P>One of the Premier League (Persian Gulf Cup) teams had very bad results this year. The board is under pressure to fire the coach, but the coach is considered hero by some fans and it is not easy to fire him. The board decides to give him a last chance; they talked to media that they can only support the coach if the team gets at least 11 points in the next 5 matches. The coach wants to know the probability of passing their condition and ask you to help him. You can assume that the probability of having a win/draw/loss in a future match can be determined from the results of the matches the team currently has played. For example, if the team has already played 10 matches and has won three of them, the probability of having a win in any of the next five matches is 30%.

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I><SUB>2</SUB> = 10</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the cost of word ``<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>aba</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>`` is 1+10+1=12. Similarly, the cost of a language with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> words is equal to the sum of the costs of its <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> words. For example, the cost of language ``<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ab</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>"; ``<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>bbb</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>"; ``<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>baaa</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>" is!
  11+30+13=54. Like her previous jobs, Yungom is going to do this task perfectly which means that she wants to find the minimum cost, prefix free language with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> words.

<P>A new island has been discovered. A team of architects has worked hard and proposed a road plan to connect important parts of this new island. Due to lack of fund, we are to modify the design to come up with an affordable one.<P>In the proposed plan, each road has a unique id between 1 and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> (the number of roads) and a cost that is unbelievably equal to <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<SUP>id</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. So, the costs are distinct powers of two. We want to eliminate some of the roads from the plan to get the minimum overall cost while all places are still connected. But, we should not eliminate as many roads as we want. The constraint is that in the new road plan the distance between any two places cannot become more than twice as their distance in the original plan. The distance between two places is the minimum number of roads connecting them. The original road plan is given to you in form of a graph and you are asked to find the most economic road elimination according to the constraint.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>There are multiple test cases in the input.

In this problem, by the word ``dictionary" we mean a list of alphabetically ordered words and their associated explanations in the same language. A dictionary must contain the definition for any word that appears in the explanation of another word. So you see, if a dictionary defines <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> words, it has exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> distinct words in it. Also, we know that in a dictionary no word appears in the definition of itself. 

<P>
A sub-dictionary is a collection of dictionary's words and their definitions such that it can be published as an independent dictionary, obviously satisfying the mentioned condition. As a project of Computational Linguistics course, we are assigned to create a Lexical Knowledge Base which is the knowledge expressed by words. For this task we should create our knowledge foundation based on a dictionary. 

<P>
It's really hard for the computer to study words automatically. So, we decided to manually teach it some common words. We start from an appropriate sub-dictionary. By understanding its words, a computer could extend its knowledge to the whole dictionary word by word. For instance, a word ``xyz" could be added to the computer's understanding if computer knows the meaning of every words used in xyz's definition. You are asked to write a program that can find the smallest extendable sub-dictionary for a specific dictionary.

<P>SSC is a super computer designed in Sharif University having 2 ``master" and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> ``slave" processors. It can run softwares in parallel: One of the master processors loads the software on the slave processors such that the memory and CPU usage among them are balanced, while the other master is used for monitoring the system.<P>Because of the dependencies between different parts of the software, many messages should be exchanged between processors. A very fast network is needed to minimize the message passing overhead. To optimize the network, a <SPAN CLASS="textit">clique</SPAN> structure will be constructed in which there is a direct communication cable between each pair of processors.<P>There are two different cables: blue cables which can transmit up to 100 Megabits per second and red cables which can transmit up to 1 Gigabits per second. Each pair of slave processors will be connected by one blue cable. Due to the higher communication volume on master processors, the two masters are connected by one red cable and also each master is connected to each slave by another red cable.<P>SSC is thus made of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> + 2</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> motherboards, each containing exactly one processor, the needed memory, and also <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> + 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> similar network sockets installed as a horizontal array. The motherboards are put in a vertical rack box, each in one horizontal shelf. So, each motherboard is uniquely identified by its height in the rack.<P>The cooling system has forced us to put the two master motherboards in the lowest and highest shelves of the rack. We assume that the master in the bottom has height 0, and the heights of the other motherboards are integers higher than 0. You, as a computer engineer, are asked to do the final assembly of SSC. You are given the empty rack box, the ready motherboards, and your job is to determine whether you can put the boards in the rack that satisfy the constraints and cable lengths.<P>There are exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>n</I> + 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> red cables available with the given sizes. However the blue cables are available in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> different sizes, and we have unlimited number of cables in each size.

He can hop so fast that we assume the time taken per hop is negligible.<P>The tricky part is this: The stones may sink and resurface! Within a time interval, a stone may sink at the middle of the interval, remains submerged and may resurface at the middle of another interval. If Indiana Jones is standing on a sinking stone, he will drown. Of course, Indiana Jones cannot hop to a stone that is submerged. At 12 noon, all stones are above the water and Indiana Jones is ready to hop. He has already derived the pattern of sinking/resurfacing for each stone during the next few intervals. Our task is to find the fastest way to cross the river.<P>Figure 1 shows an example of sinking and resurfacing stones over time.

<P>In a large church in New Zealand, after the church service, the priest gives an empty collection box that can hold <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> dollar coins to the ``light-fingered usher". The usher then passes the collection box to a nearby parishioner. When receiving the box a parishioner adds a few dollar coins, then passes it to another nearby parishioner.

As soon as the box is full, containing c coins, it is immediately passed to the priest, even when a parishioner cannot finish entering all the coins specified by the chosen rule.<P>Your problem is to compute the maximal possible gain for the usher, which is achieved when the parishioners always choose a rule that leads to the biggest number of coins in the usher's pocket.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of a line containing the number c of datasets, followed by c datasets, followed by a line containing the number `<TT>0</TT>'.<P>The first line of each dataset contains two numbers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, separated by a blank.

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Problem F -- RC Codes<o:p></o:p></h1>

<p

 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">After

seeing the movie Die Hard 4, Rakesh, a 14 year old

school student, became very interested in Cyber Security. He started

reading up a

lot on the subject. He came up with a coding scheme for characters that

he

called âRCâ, in which each character is stored as a variable length

code. <span style=""> </span>(A variable length code is where the

length of

the code is not necessarily the same even for plaintexts of the same

length.)<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">Rakesh

wanted to represent RC codes as binary trees (called RTree), and he

introduced

a rule for the creation of RC codes called the prefix property. In an

RC code no

character code is a prefix of any other character code. For example,

character

strings over the alphabet <span style="font-family: "EUSM10","serif";">{</span><span

 style="font-family: CMTT12;">m</span><span

 style="font-family: "EURM10","serif";">,

</span><span style="font-family: CMTT12;">n</span><span

 style="font-family: "EURM10","serif";">,

</span><span style="font-family: CMTT12;">o</span><span

 style="font-family: "EURM10","serif";">,

</span><span style="font-family: CMTT12;">p</span><span

 style="font-family: "EUSM10","serif";">}

</span>could be stored internally using the RC Code <span

 style="font-family: "EUSM10","serif";">{</span><span

 style="font-family: CMTT12;">m</span><span

 style="font-family: "EUFM10","serif";">= </span><span

 style="font-family: CMTT12;">00</span><span

 style="font-family: "EURM10","serif";">, </span><span

 style="font-family: CMTT12;">n

</span><span style="font-family: "EUFM10","serif";">= </span><span

 style="font-family: CMTT12;">010</span><span

 style="font-family: "EURM10","serif";">,

</span><span style="font-family: CMTT12;">o </span><span

 style="font-family: "EUFM10","serif";">=

</span><span style="font-family: CMTT12;">011</span><span

 style="font-family: "EURM10","serif";">, </span><span

 style="font-family: CMTT12;">p </span><span

 style="font-family: "EUFM10","serif";">= </span><span

 style="font-family: CMTT12;">1</span><span

 style="font-family: "EUSM10","serif";">}</span>.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">Because

of the prefix property, an RC can be represented as a binary tree

(RTree) whose

leaves are the alphabet characters and whose left and right branches

are

(implicitly) labeled <span style="font-family: CMTT12;">0 </span>and <span

 style="font-family: CMTT12;">1</span>, respectively. The leaves of the

tree are

arranged so that the code of a character is read as the string of

branch labels

leading from the root to the leaf. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">Write a

program that inputs an RTree (representing an RC code) and a bit string

consisting of contiguously stored character codes, and that outputs the

bit

string decoded into its corresponding string of characters.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><b style=""> Input Format

(STDIN)<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">The first

line of input is an integer number N (0 < N < 20) indicating the

number

of test cases. The next line contains an RTree. If a tree is a single

leaf, it

appears as a single character; otherwise, if it has sub trees, it

appears as a

left parenthesis, followed by the left RTree sub tree, followed by a

comma,

followed by the right RTree sub tree, followed by a right parenthesis.

You can

assume every non-leaf tree (tree that is not a leaf) has two non-empty

sub

trees. Also there will be atleast two leaves.For example, the RTree representing the RC code in the second

paragraph

would appear as ((m,(n,o)),p). The next line is again an integer number

M (0

< M < 20) that indicates the number of lines of binary codes to

decode(whose length is atmost 1000 characters). The

subsequent lines each contain a nonempty binary string to be decoded.

With that,

the input for a test case ends. <span style=""> </span>If there

are more than one test case the data for the next test case continues

just

below the end of the first test case. You may assume that all inputs to

your

program will be valid cryptograms that can be successfully decoded.<span

 style="font-family: "calibri","sans-serif";"> <span

 style="font-family: times new roman;">We will use only the 26 English

lower case characters.</span> </span><span

of the binary strings to be decoded, print the string of characters

that the

binary string represents, one per line, without intervening or

terminating

blank lines.<o:p></o:p></p>

<center><h2>Problem H -- Postmaster's Wish</h2></center>
<p>A post master wishes to automate the sorting operation at his post office, since he finds that on an average the number of people assigned to the sorting operation are either heavily loaded or idle, ultimately resulting in loss of man hours that could have been efficiently used.
He comes up with an idea of an automatic sorting machine that has a fixed capacity to hold the input letters and that sorts the letters at a fixed output rate. 
Depending upon the arrival of letters to the sorter, once the sorter is full of letters, the excess letters that would cause the sorting box to overflow have to be dropped into a bin to be manually sorted afterwards.</p>
<p>
You are working for a company that has been called by the postmaster for a meeting to demonstrate a software simulation of the sorter. The following scenarios need to be shown in the simulation to him:
<ul>
<li>a) Sorter box is completely filled.</li>
<li>b) Sorter box is drained out.</li>
<li>c) Sorter box overflows.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
At the beginning of every second:
<ul>
<li>A certain number of messages arrive, and they are added to the sorter bin of a fixed capacity <b>C</b>. Excess messages cause overflow into the manual sorter bin.
<li>From the letters that are pending to be sorted, the sorter acts and sorts <b>R</b> letters.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Input Format (STDIN)</b>:<br>
Input consists of multiple testcases.<br>
The first line of each testcase contains two integers: <b>C</b> <b>R</b> <b>M</b> (1 <= <b>M</b> <= 100; 1 <= <b>R</b> <= <b>C</b> <= 20,000) representing 
the capacity of the sorter, the fixed-rate of sorting of the sorter and the number of messages. <br>
The following <b>M</b> lines contain one integer each, <b>i</b>-th line representing the number of letters that arrived,
at time <b>i</b>. Each of these integers will be in the inclusive range [0,1000].<br>
Input ends with a line containing three zeros.
</p>

<p><b>Output Format (STDOUT)</b>:<br>

Output to each test case must begin with a line containing "Case #&lt;case-number&gt;:".<br>
Each test-case must contain <b>M</b> lines, with exactly 5 integers each, which the state of the sorter after
every unit of time. The five integers represent the following:
<ul>
<li>Current time (The i-th line will be just i).
<li>Letters received (Same as the input for the i-th line).
<li>Letters sorted (Number of letters the sorter sorted at this unit of time; must be less than or equal to <b>R</b>).
<li>Sorter balance (Number of pending letters in the sorter; must be less than or equal to <b>C</b>).
<li>Number of letters dumped into the manual sorter bin.
</ul>
There should be a blank line after each test-case.<br>

Unfortunately, when you arrive at a customer site to install some air conditioning ducts, you discover that you are running low on supplies. You have only six duct segments, and they are all of the same kind, called an ``elbow.''<P>You must install a duct in a confined space: a rectangular prism whose sides are multiples of a unit length. Think of the confined space as consisting of an array of unit cubes. Each elbow occupies exactly four unit cubes, as shown in Figure 1 below. A unit cube can be occupied by at most one elbow. Each elbow has exactly two openings, as indicated by the gray squares in the elbow shown in Figure 1. You may assemble the elbows into longer ducts, but your duct must be completely contained inside the given space. One way to connect two elbows is shown in Figure 2. Your task is to connect an inflow to an outflow. The inflow and the outflow are located on the exterior surface of the confined space, aligned with the unit cubes, as shown in Figure 3. To keep expenses down, you must accomplish this task while using the minimum number of elbows. out<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="1080" HEIGHT="328" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4118.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4118.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of several test cases, each of which consists of a single line containing eleven input values separated by blanks.

To prevent this, you can connect shafts only when the distance between the points where the belt leaves one shaft and touches the other is less than some distance d (the exact value of d varies depending on the type of belt). </LI><LI>No belt can cross over itself, as shown in Figure 3. </LI><LI>No belt can pass through another shaft (or touch one rotating the wrong way), as shown in Figure 4. </LI><LI>The belt is not a loop; it goes in only one direction, from the starting shaft to the ending shaft.

<P>A <SPAN CLASS="textit">hare and hounds</SPAN> road rally requires contestants (the ``hounds") to identify a route of one or more roads selected by the organizer (the ``hare"). Both parties move over roads that meet at various intersections. Upon entering any intersection (except special ones to be described shortly), both the hound and the hare select routes using the <SPAN CLASS="textit">main road rule</SPAN>. The main road rule is always ``straight as possible," meaning make the smallest turn (perhaps none) necessary to continue. If there are two such choices possible (such as at some ``Y" intersections), the main road rule dictates the rightmost (from the point of view of the hound) of the two acceptable alternatives should be selected.<P>At certain intersections, the hare may violate the main road rule by taking a random road away from the intersection (though never the original road used to reach the intersection). These intersections are marked by the hare as <SPAN CLASS="textit">choice points</SPAN> (usually by a colored mark on the pavement in the intersection). When reaching a choice point, the hound must try each road leaving the intersection and travel that road (potentially traveling through other intersections) until reaching a <SPAN CLASS="textit">confirmation marker</SPAN> (usually some flour dumped by the hare on the road) confirming the correct route selection. An incorrect route selection is indicated by one of the following:<P><UL><LI>The hound travels a specified maximum distance from the choice point before reaching a confirmation marker. </LI><LI>The hound reaches a ``dead end" (an ``intersection" with only one road to it) before reaching the confirmation marker. </LI><LI>The hound reaches a choice point before reaching the confirmation marker. (The hare always places a confirmation marker on the route following a choice point. Also, the hare never returns to a previous choice point.) </LI></UL><P>After detecting an incorrect route, the hound must trace back along the route taken to the choice point and select a different route alternative. If the hound encounters the endpoint while looking for a confirmation marker, he ignores it.<P>When selecting routes from a choice point, the hound uses the main road rule in a slightly different way. The first road selected is the same as if the intersection were not a choice point. But if the hound must return to the choice point (i.e., the first road taken from the choice point was not part of the hare's route), then the hound chooses the second road using the main road rule from the direction with which he returns to the choice point (ignoring any direction that he has already tried as well as the direction that he originally arrived from). This process repeats each time the hound returns to the choice point until he finds the proper route. This multiple use of the main road rule occurs only at choice points. For the purposes of this problem, the hound will not remember the result of traveling down any road, even if he returns to it multiple times while exploring one choice point.<P>For this problem you will be given a road map (a configuration of roads and intersections), the list of choice point intersections, the placement of confirmation markers, the maximum distance from a choice point to a confirmation marker, the starting and ending intersections (neither of which will be choice points), and the direction to be used in leaving the starting intersection.

Dan McAmbi is a member of a crack counter-espionage team and has recently obtained the partial contents of a file containing information vital to his nation's interests. The file had been compressed using Huffman encoding. Unfortunately, the part of the file that Dan has shows only the Huffman codes themselves, not the compressed information. Since Huffman codes are based on the frequencies of the characters in the original message, Dan's boss thinks that some information might be obtained if Dan can reverse the Huffman encoding process and obtain the character frequencies from the Huffman codes. Dan's gut reaction to this is that any given set of codes could be obtained from a wide variety of frequency distributions, but his boss is not impressed with this reasoned analysis. So Dan has come to you to get more definitive proof to take back to his boss. 

<P>
Huffman encoding is an optimal data compression method if you know in advance the relative frequencies of letters in the text to be compressed. The method works by first constructing a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Huffman tree</SPAN> as follows. Start with a forest of trees, each tree a single node containing a character from the text and its frequency (the character value is used only in the leaves of the resulting tree). Each step of the construction algorithm takes the two trees with the lowest frequency values (choosing arbitrarily if there are ties), and replaces them with a new tree formed by joining the two trees as the left and right subtrees of a new root node. The frequency value of the new root is the sum of the frequencies of the two subtrees. This procedure repeats until only one tree is left. An example of this is shown below, assuming we have a file with only 5 characters -- A, B, C, D and E -- with frequencies 10%, 14%, 31%, 25% and 20%, respectively.

<P>
After you have constructed a Huffman tree, assign the Huffman codes to the characters as follows. Label each left branch of the tree with a 0 and each right branch with a 1. Reading down from the root to each character gives the Huffman code for that character. The tree above results in the following Huffman codes: A - 010, B - 011, C - 11, D - 10 and E - 00. 

<P>
For the purpose of this problem, the tree with the lower frequency <SPAN  CLASS="textit">always</SPAN> becomes the left subtree of the new tree. If both trees have the same frequencies, either of the two trees can be chosen as the left subtree. Note that this means that for some frequency distributions, there are several valid Huffman encodings. 

<P>
The same Huffman encoding can be obtained from several different frequency distributions: change 14% to 13% and 31% to 32%, and you still get the same tree and thus the same codes. Dan wants you to write a program to determine the total number of distinct ways you could get a given Huffman encoding, assuming that all percentages are positive integers. Note that two frequency distributions that differ only in the ordering of their percentages (for example 30% 70% for one distribution and 70% 30% for another) are not distinct.

The famous Glenbow Museum in Calgary is Western Canada's largest museum, with exhibits ranging from art to cultural history to mineralogy. A brand new section is being planned, devoted to brilliant computer programmers just like you. Unfortunately, due to lack of space, the museum is going to have to build a brand new building and relocate into it. 

<P>
The size and capacity of the new building differ from those of the original building. But the floor plans of both buildings are orthogonal polygons. An orthogonal polygon is a polygon whose internal angles are either 90Â° or 270Â°. If 90Â° angles are denoted as R (Right) and 270Â° angles are denoted as O (Obtuse) then a string containing only R and O can roughly describe an orthogonal polygon. For example, a rectangle (Figure 1) is the simplest orthogonal polygon and it can be described as RRRR (the angles are listed in counter-clockwise order, starting from any corner). Similarly, a cross-shaped orthogonal polygon (Figure 2) can be described by the sequence RRORRORRORRO, RORRORRORROR, or ORRORRORRORR. These sequences are called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">angle strings</SPAN>.

<P>

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>
</DIV>

<P>
Of course, an angle string does not completely specify the shape of a polygon -- it says nothing about the length of the sides. And some angle strings cannot possibly describe a valid orthogonal polygon (RRROR, for example). 

<P>
To complicate things further, not all orthogonal polygons are acceptable floor plans for the museum. A museum contains many valuable objects, and these objects must be guarded. Due to cost considerations, no floor can have more than one guard. So a floor plan is acceptable only if there is a place within the floor from which one guard can see the entire floor. Similarly, an angle string is acceptable only if it describes at least one acceptable polygon. Note that the cross-shaped polygon in Figure 2 can be guarded by someone standing in the center, so it is acceptable. Thus the angle string RRORRORRORRO is acceptable, even though it also describes other polygons that cannot be properly guarded by a single guard. 

<P>
Help the designers of the new building determine how many acceptable angle strings there are of a given length.

<P>Rose N. Blatt is designing an embedded neural network to place inside a cell phone. When trained by the phone's owner, the neural network will enable the user to dictate text messages in a hands-free way. The key idea in Rose's design is the use of complicated polynomial response functions in each of the nodes of the network (rather than the more traditional thresholding functions used in many other neural nets). Figure 1 shows a portion of such a neural network (the polynomials are not accurately graphed).<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="692" HEIGHT="390" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4124a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4124a.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>When Rose was ready to select her polynomials, she discovered a problem.

He also believed in the use of simple geometric forms.<P>During his triangle period, Peer drew triangles on a rectangular canvas, making sure their borders did not intersect. He would then choose a color, and fill the regions. Peer would paint the outermost region (the canvas itself) with the lightest shade of the color chosen. Then step by step, he would fill more inner regions with a darker shade of the same color.

<P>The city of Banff hired an advertising agency to promote the city's attractions to potential visitors. One of the planned slogans stated that the mountain ranges around the city form the most beautiful skyline in Canada. But the Institute for Consumer Protection in Canada (ICPC) decided that ``the most beautiful skyline" was a subjective and unverifiable claim, and could therefore be considered misleading.<P>The advertising agency then came up with the slogan ``Banff - the longest skyline in Canada." Although not as catchy, it is hopefully verifiable, and therefore admissible under Canada's tricky advertising laws.<P>This is where you come in. What the advertising agency needs is a program that determines the length of a skyline. Consider each mountain as a two-dimensional triangle having two upper sides the same length. A skyline is the outline of one or more mountains. The skyline's length is the total length of the outline. The left illustration below shows three mountains. The right illustration shows (with bold lines) the skyline and (with dashed lines) the portion of the mountains' upper edges that are not part of the skyline. Note that parts of the horizon line that lie between mountains are not considered part of the skyline.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="1027" HEIGHT="210" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4127.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4127.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Each input file contains one or more test cases, which are descriptions of mountain ranges.

<P>
Johnny drives a steam roller, which like all steam rollers is slow and takes a relatively long time to start moving, change direction, and brake to a full stop. Johnny has just finished his day's work and is driving his steam roller home to see his wife. Your task is to find the fastest path for him and his steam roller. 

<P>
The city where Johnny lives has a regular structure (the streets form an orthogonal system). The city streets are laid out on a rectangular grid of intersections. Each intersection is connected to its neighbors (up to four of them) by a street. Each street is exactly one block long. When Johnny enters a street, he must always travel to the other end (continue to the next intersection). From that point, he can continue in any of the four possible directions to another intersection, and so on. 

<P>
By studying the road conditions of the streets, Johnny has calculated the time needed to go from one end to the other of every street in town. The time is the same for both directions. However, Johnny's calculations hold only under the ideal condition that the steam roller is already in motion when it enters a street and does not need to accelerate or brake. Whenever the steam roller changes direction at a intersection directly before or after a street, the estimated ideal time for that street must be doubled. The same holds if the roller begins moving from a full stop (for example at the beginning of Johnny's trip) or comes to a full stop (for example at the end of his trip). 

<P>
The following picture shows an example. The numbers show the ``ideal" times needed to drive through the corresponding streets. Streets with missing numbers are unusable for steam rollers. Johnny wants to go from the top-left corner to the bottom-right one.

</DIV>

<P>
The path consisting of streets labeled with 9's seems to be faster at the first sight. However, due to the braking and accelerating restrictions, it takes double the estimated time for every street on the path, making the total time 108. The path along the streets labeled with 10's is faster because Johnny can drive two of the streets at the full speed, giving a total time of 100.

<P>Ms Millerose is an old hand in the local newspaper business. Throughout her whole career, she has worked in a big hall where each reporter occupies one of the desks neatly organized into a grid. The typewriters are now gone and have been replaced by computers, but that does not bother her.

<P>After traveling widely over many decades, <SPAN CLASS="textit">Bint Fatuma</SPAN> has accumulated a fortune in many different currencies.

<P>You work for a company that develops bar code scanners. A client has recently approached your company to assist in the development of a scanner for a particular type of barcode that he has designed himself. It soon became clear that this particular barcode is not incredibly robust to errors, but since you are not the one playing golf with the client, there is not much you can do about it.<P>Like most linear bar codes, this code consists of a sequence of alternating black and white bars. A sample of this code, encoding the value 602206, looks like this:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="422" HEIGHT="166" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4132.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p4132.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1: Sample bar code, with a value of 602206.</DIV><P>The sequence of bars can be partitioned into three parts: a <SPAN CLASS="textit">start code</SPAN>, the <SPAN CLASS="textit">body</SPAN>, and the <SPAN CLASS="textit">stop code</SPAN>. Observe that there are actually four kinds of bars in the sample shown in Figure 1: <SPAN CLASS="textit">narrow black</SPAN> bars, <SPAN CLASS="textit">wide black</SPAN> bars, <SPAN CLASS="textit">narrow white</SPAN> bars and <SPAN CLASS="textit">wide white</SPAN> bars. The wide bars are exactly twice as wide as the narrow bars. The white bars and the black bars alternate strictly, so you can never have two consecutive narrow black bars, which might have been mistaken for a wide black bar.<P>The function of the alternation of black and white is thus merely to allow us to identify the individual bars. In fact, you can reduce the four types of bar to just two types: <SPAN CLASS="textit">narrow</SPAN> (N) and <SPAN CLASS="textit">wide</SPAN> (W). A sequence of 5 consecutive bars can be mapped to the integers 0-9 using the following table:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"></DIV><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=2 BORDER RULES=GROUPS><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COL ALIGN=LEFT><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><B>Digit</B></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><B>Sequence</B></TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>0</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>NNWWN</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>1</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>WNNNW</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>2</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>NWNNW</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>3</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>WWNNN</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>4</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>NNWNW</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>5</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>WNWNN</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>6</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>NWWNN</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>7</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>NNNWW</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>8</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>WNNWN</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>9</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>NWNWN</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P><P><BR>Similarly, the <SPAN CLASS="textit">start code</SPAN> is encoded as NNNN, and the <SPAN CLASS="textit">stop code</SPAN> is encoded as WNN. You can easily spot the start and stop codes in the sample barcode above, but before you can decode the <SPAN CLASS="textit">body</SPAN> of the code, you first have to de-interleave the bars belonging to the body.<P>This particular bar code system always contains an even number of digits (and thus also bars) in the body. This allows us to interleave the bars of each pair of digits to effectively use both the white and black bars to encode information. For example, the digits 6 and 0 have encodings NWWNN and NNWWN, respectively. If these two encodings are interleaved, we end up with NNWNWWNWNN. Formally, if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I><SUB>n, m</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> represents the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th bar of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th digit of the number being encoded, the interleaving produces<P><P></P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay"><I>b</I><SUB>n, 0</SUB><I>b</I><SUB>n+1, 0</SUB><I>b</I><SUB>n, 1</SUB><I>b</I><SUB>n+1, 1</SUB><I>b</I><SUB>n, 2</SUB><I>b</I><SUB>n+1, 2</SUB><SUP> ... </SUP><I>b</I><SUB>n, 4</SUB><I>b</I><SUB>n+1, 4</SUB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>b</I><SUB>n+2, 0</SUB><I>b</I><SUB>n+3, 0</SUB><I>b</I><SUB>n+2, 1</SUB><I>b</I><SUB>n+3, 1</SUB><SUP> ... </SUP></DIV><P><tex2html_verbatim_mark></P><P>Continuing the example, if we prefix our interleaved sequence (corresponding to `60') with the start code, we get NNNN NNWNWWNWNN -- this sequence matches the first 14 bars of Figure 1. Subsequent pairs of digits, such as 22 (or 06) in the sample above, are interleaved in the same way.<P>That takes care of the specification of the bar code. The bar code reader that your company has developed scans the code using a laser. The laser scans left-to-right across the bar code at a fixed rate, sampling the the output of a photodetector at fixed intervals. The photodetector produces a `<TT>1</TT>' bit if no reflected light is detected (over a black bar), and a `<TT>0</TT>' otherwise (over a white bar). Given the sample shown in Figure 1, the bar code scanner produces the output sequence<P><P><BR><TT>10101011011001001010110010101100101001100110101101</TT>.<P><P><BR>Note that a narrow bar is represented by a single bit, and a wide bar by a pair of bits. In a perfect universe, it would be a simple matter of reversing the steps above to recover the value of the body of the code represented by this bit sequence. Unfortunately, the bar code scanner occasionally inverts (i.e., <SPAN CLASS="MATH">0 <IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4132.jpg ALT="$ \rightarrow$"> 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, or <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1 <IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4132.jpg ALT="$ \rightarrow$"> 0</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) the value of at most one bit in the sequence, which sometimes results in a sequence that is decodable, but which produces the wrong value when decoded.<P>To compensate for this, the quick fix was to require that all the values encoded in the body must be palindromes, i.e., the second half of the sequence of decimal digits must be the reverse of those in the first half, just like the value 602206.<P>Your task is to take the sequence of bits produced by the scanner, and to decode them to retrieve the value represented by the bar code.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your input will consist of an arbitrary number of records, one record per line, with each record representing a sequence of bits produced by the scanner.<P>The length of each input record will be limited to a maximum of 200 bits.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your output will be a single integer value for each input record.

Your friend has asked you to write a program to check whether a given number is a Fibonacci hypotenuse, as described above.<P>After a bit of research, you have identified the following useful test:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>A positive integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is a Fibonacci number if and only if one of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">5<I>z</I><SUP>2</SUP> + 4</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> or <SPAN CLASS="MATH">5<I>z</I><SUP>2</SUP> - 4</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is a perfect square.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>A perfect square is an integer of which the square root is also an integer, such as the number 25, for example.

The list of numbers that you received from your friend are in the range <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[0, 2<SUP>30</SUP>]</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Since your Fibonacci test involves squaring the input numbers, your intermediate results will be in the range <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[0, 2<SUP>60</SUP>]</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, which exceeds the range of 32-bit integer variables.

You are part of Q's team, and you are developing a spy pen that can be used to scan documents while no one is looking. Owing to physical constraints, the pen is not able to capture very large images with its camera, thus it was designed to scan narrow strips of text, which will be assembled in the correct order afterwards. 

<P>
One of your colleagues has already developed the optical character recognition (OCR) software, so your task has been simplified to the point of just figuring out how to string the fragments of text together. 

<P>
Unfortunately, the field operatives who will be using the pens are not known for their steady hands (too many Martinis, possibly), so it is possible that some of the text fragments appear twice, or that one of the fragments is completely subsumed by another fragment. Your program must be able to handle these cases correctly.

Like it or not, you are an engineer. In the army, of all places. At least they have managed to find you a problem worthy of your skills: design an optimal road network with minimum risk. 

<P>
Having recently invaded a new region, your forces have established a number of small bases all over the countryside. Since good logistics (i.e., moving people around in a hurry so that they can sit and wait at a different location) is an important ingredient of any army, you have been tasked with building an optimal road network to connect all these bases. In your army the optimality of a road network is not measured by its total length, but by the effort it takes to secure the network every day. Securing the network comprises two activities: sweeping the dirt road segments for landmines, and checking bridges for explosives. 

<P>
To make things simpler, you have mapped these two activities to the same scale. The cost of sweeping a dirt road is relative to its length, while the cost of checking a bridge for explosives receives a fixed cost of 4 units. 

<P>
You have at your disposal a list of all the bases you have to connect, as well as a list of the potential connections that can be made between these bases. From this list of potential connections, you have to choose the connections that will minimise the total cost of securing the network. 

<P>
A number of your bases have been established on river banks. These bases were all established in pairs, with one on each side of the river. As part of your task of building the optimal road network, you have to choose where you wish to build bridges between these suitable river bank bases. You can choose to build bridges at any (or all) of these locations, but there are some constraints: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<OL>
<LI>Each bridge you build will cost you 4 maintenance units to check it for explosives. 
</LI>
<LI>Your resulting network must be connected, i.e., every base must be reachable from every other base. 
</LI>
<LI>Every road segment that is directly connected to a bridge has to be swept more thoroughly, and therefore costs double the usual number of units to sweep. 
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Figure 1 illustrates the various types of road segment. The segment connecting base `a' to base `b' is a bridge (we chose to build one here), with a maintenance cost of 4 units. The solid lines emanating from these two bases represent road segments that are considered to be directly connected to the bridge, and hence their maintenance cost must be doubled if the bridge is actually built. If we choose to not build a bridge between `a' and `b', then the normal maintenance costs would apply to these segments.

<P>Lately, there is one serious problem with Panda Land Safe Box: several safes have been robbed! The safes are using old 4-digits rolling lock combination (you only have to roll the digit, either up or down, until all four of them match the key). Each digit is designed to roll from 0 to 9. Rolling-up at 9 will make the digit become 0, and rolling-down at 0 will make the digit become 9. Since there are only 10000 possible keys, 0000 through 9999, anyone can try all the combinations until the safe is unlocked.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="549" HEIGHT="166" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4138.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p4138.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>What's done is done.

In an archeology excavation in the Panda Land, the panda researchers found artifacts from the technologically advanced Bracket Panda civilization which lives around year 2008 BGP - Before Giant Panda. The artifacts are in the form of a big stone tablet with inscriptions on it (seems to be some kind of codes) and some locked treasure chests labeled as ``bonus" by the ancient pandas, each chest have numbers inscribed on them as well as several switches labeled with `<TT>(</TT>' and `<TT>)</TT>'. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
After much research and decoding, the researchers found the following results: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Codes in the tablet describe a master sequence as the source of all possible switch positions (a.k.a. combination codes for opening the chest). In other words, all valid codes are defined as subsets of particular terms in the sequence. The terms of the master sequence are defined as being the concatenation of all previous terms of the sequence enclosed in the outer parenthesis `<TT>(</TT>' and `<TT>)</TT>', as follows: <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>1</SUB> =</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark><TT>()</TT>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>2</SUB> =</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark><TT>(())</TT>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>3</SUB> =</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark><TT>(()(()))</TT>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>4</SUB> =</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark><TT>(()(())(()(()))</TT>, and so on. 
</LI>
<LI>There are three numbers in each treasure chest. The first number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, describes the term number in master sequence containing the code, the second number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, is a zero based index describing the position of starting character of the code in the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th sequence term, and the last one <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, describes the length of the sequence (number of the switches in the chest).
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
For larger values of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the master sequence's term can become extremely long as the term's length is in the order of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<SUP>N</SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (as you may have figured out previously). Therefore as an elite programmer in Panda Land, you are given a task to write a program for decoding the combination codes - all that the program needs to do is printing the correct combination code required to open the treasure box, given the three numbers <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>N</I>, <I>K</I>, <I>M</I>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> inscribed on the treasure chest.

There's a special island in Panda Land called Casino Island where all gambling activities are legalized. Here, a well known betting game called Tipu-Tipu is held every month. 

<P>
Each gambler could place only one bet. Each bet should consists of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> distinct numbers from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is chosen by the gambler). Each month, the game owner will announce a sequence of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> distinct numbers (the `master') and each bet will be matched to this sequence for a prize. The prize will be given if and only if the bet match perfectly to the master's prefix. In other word, a bet of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> numbers, should match the first <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> numbers of the master. And yes, a higher <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> will gives you a higher prize but also a higher risk of not gaining anything.

One thing all these chess programs have in common though is a need to determine when the winning move, or <i>checkmate</i>, is reached. Your goal for this problem is to implement an algorithm such that, given the current layout of the chessboard, it will detect if a checkmate has occurred during that turn.<p>Chess is played on a board divided into a 8x8 grid of 64 squares. On a real chessboard, the 64 squares have alternating light and dark colors. For this problem the individual square colors are irrelevant and the entire board is simply treated as a uniform 8x8 grid.<p>The game is played by two opposing sides, white and black, with each side controlling up to six kinds of pieces: a <i>king</i>, <i>queen</i>, <i>rook</i>, <i>bishop</i>, <i>knight</i>, and one or more <i>pawn</i>s. For simplicity's sake, however, this problem will only consider the first five and not make any use of the pawn chess piece. The two players take turns moving one piece at a time on every turn. It is up to each player to decide which piece they wish to move on their turn, but it is not possible for a player to "skip" or "pass"; each player <b>must</b> move one of their pieces in some fashion.<p>Each kind of chess piece moves in a distinct way as explained in the list below, and <i>Figure 1</i> gives an example using an X to show each square that a chess piece can move to.<ul class="example"><li><i>Rook</i>: The rook moves in a straight line by any number of squares in any of the four cardinal (horizontal and vertical) directions. </li><li><i>Bishop</i>: The bishop moves in a line by any number of squares in any of the four diagonal directions. </li><li><i>Queen</i>: The queen can move in a line by any number of squares in any of the eight cardinal and diagonal directions. As such, it is considered to be the most powerful piece in the game. </li><li><i>Knight</i>: The knight always moves by "jumping" two squares in one cardinal direction and one square in a direction perpendicular to the first. There are 8 possible squares that a knight can move to from a given position, and these are shown in the figure below. </li><li><i>King</i>: The king can move in any of the eight cardinal and diagonal directions but by one square only. Put another way, the king can only move into the eight immediately adjacent squares. As such, this makes the king one of the weakest pieces on the board. </li></ul><table class="example" border="0" align="center"><tr><td><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4148a.png> </object><br><i>Rook</i></td><td><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4148a.png> </object><br><i>Bishop</i></td><td><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4148a.png> </object><br><i>Queen</i></td><td><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4148a.png> </object><br><i>Knight</i></td><td><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4148a.png> </object><br><i>King</i></td></tr><caption><b>Figure 1:</b> Valid moves for each kind of chess piece</caption></table>On every turn, a chess piece may be moved either into a vacant square or into a square already occupied by an opposing piece. In the latter case, the opposing chess piece is said to be <i>captured</i> and is permanently removed from the game. However, a chess piece <b>may not</b> move into a square already occupied by another friendly piece, because each square can be occupied by at most one piece at a time. Most chess pieces move by "sliding" across vacant squares on the board. In other words, any other chess piece (be it friendly or foe) in the path of the moving piece will block any further movement of that piece. The only exception to this rule is the knight which "jumps" directly to its final destination square, and therefore its movement cannot be blocked by any surrounding pieces between it and the destination square. See <i>Figure 2</i> for an example: image (a) shows a white rook's movement blocked by two other pieces, and image (b) shows the same white rook capturing a black bishop (the rook's previous position before the capture is shown as a white outline).<p><table class="example" border="0" align="center"><tr><td><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4148a.png> </object><br><i>(a)</i></td><td><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4148a.png> </object><br><i>(b)</i></td></tr><caption><b>Figure 2:</b> (a) rook's movement blocked by other pieces; (b) rook capturing the black bishop</caption></table>Although the king may be one of the weakest pieces on the board, it is also the most important. A king cannot be captured directly by another piece but it can be threatened. When the king is threatened, or <i>checked</i>, it means that on the <b>next</b> turn, the opposing side would be able to capture the king. Putting a king in check forces the checked side to defend their king by moving the king out of harm's way, blocking the threat with another piece, or capturing the threatening piece. If the checked player has no valid move that they can make to protect the king, then the king is in fact <i>checkmated</i>, and that player has lost the game. Also note that a player may never put their own king in check. <i>Figure 3</i> shows the difference between a check and checkmate. In image (a), the imminent capture of the white king can still be avoided by either moving the king out of the way or by capturing the black queen. Image (b) shows an example of checkmate, where no valid moves exist for the white side that would eliminate the threat to the king.<p><table class="example" border="0" align="center"><tr><td><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4148a.png> </object><br><i>Check</i></td><td><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4148a.png> </object><br><i>Checkmate</i></td></tr><caption><b>Figure 3:</b> Example of white king in (a) check and (b) checkmate</caption></table>The rules laid out above are the only ones that should be considered for the purposes of this problem. Any other special rules or moves present in a real game of chess, such as <i>castling</i>, are <b>not</b> considered valid in the context of this problem. For the chessboard layout in each data set, you may assume it will contain exactly one white king and exactly one black king, although either side may have any number of rooks, bishops, queens, and knights.<p><b>Input:</b><p>Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer <i>D</i> (1 &le; <i>D</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of data sets.

Instead, they are broken up into chunks (called <i>extents</i>), each of which may be located almost anywhere on the underlying disk. Each extent takes up one or more contiguous <i>blocks</i> on the disk, which represent the underlying physical disk structure. Files may not share blocks or extents between themselves, although there may be (and hopefully are) blocks not currently in use on the filesystem.<p>Despite all of the advances in modern disk technology, this disparate layout still makes for slower access than when all of a file's blocks are in order and adjacent (and therefore occupying a single extent). Because of this, many modern filesystems support <i>defragmentation</i>: the reorganizing of files on the disk so that the blocks of any given file are in order and adjacent.<p>With RAD's Awesome Dynamic Filesystem (commonly referred to as <b>RADfs</b>), a file can occupy any number of extents, each of which consists of at least two adjacent blocks. The first block in an extent holds metadata about that extent; the rest contain some portion of the file. Consider this simple representation of the extents and blocks occupied by a file:<p><pre>RADfs.doc: 57-58,102-114,23-47</pre><p>The file <tt>RADfs.doc</tt> currently occupies 40 blocks on the disk, even though the file itself is only 37 blocks in size. The smallest on-disk size that it could have is 38 blocks (37 plus a single metadata block), and that can only happen if the entire file is in a single extent. One potential single-extent representation of the file is:<p><pre>RADfs.doc: 115-152</pre><p>Here, the single metadata block (115) is followed by the 37 data blocks in a single extent.<p>The developers of RADfs have also developed the RADical Defragmentation Daemon, or RADDD. RADDD works with a simple two-step algorithm; despite its simplicity, it still manages to significantly reduce the number of extents consumed by files, given enough free space on the disk.<p>A RADDD pass works as follows:<ul><li>First Step ("to the back"):<ul><li>For every file on the filesystem that hasn't been run through this step on this pass, sorted in <b>ascending</b> order by the <b>first</b> block it occupies on the disk:<ul><li>Find the series of adjacent unused blocks nearest the <b>end</b> of the disk that can hold the file plus a single metadata block</li> <li>If such a series exists:<ul><li>Move the file to those blocks</li> <li>Mark the original blocks as unused</li></ul></li><li>Else do nothing to the file</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Second Step ("to the front"):<ul><li>For every file on the filesystem that hasn't been run through this step on this pass, sorted in <b>descending</b> order by the <b>last</b> block it occupies on the disk:<ul><li>Find the series of adjacent unused blocks nearest the <b>beginning</b> of the disk that can hold the file plus a single metadata block</li> <li>If such a series exists:<ul><li>Move the file to those blocks</li> <li>Mark the original blocks as unused</li></ul></li><li>Else do nothing to the file</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>After one pass on a filesystem with some free space, some files have hopefully been reduced to a single extent. Multiple passes can often defragment the filesystem even further.<p>Of course, it's not that simple; some files simply cannot be moved, perhaps due to being in use at the time of the run. These are marked on the filesystem as <i>immobile</i>, and are ignored by RADDD.<p>Given the size of a disk, the current layout of files on the disk, and a number of passes of RADDD to run, can you determine the final filesystem layout?<p><b>Input:</b><p>Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of data sets. Each data set consists of the following components:<ul><li>A line containing a single integer <i>S</i> (2 &le; <i>S</i> &le; 100000) indicating the number of blocks on the particular filesystem; <li>A line containing a single integer <i>C</i> (1 &le; <i>C</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of files on the filesystem; <li><i>C</i> lines representing the files on the filesystem, in the format "<tt><i>NAME</i> <i>TYPE</I> <i>E</i> <i>A</i>-<i>B</i>[ <i>X</i>-<i>Y</i>[ ...]]</tt>", where:<ul><li><i>NAME</i> is a unique (to the dataset) identifier, consisting of at least 1 and no more than 16 lowercase letters;</li> <li><i>TYPE</i> is "<tt>I</tt>" if the file is immobile, or "<tt>M</tt>" otherwise;</li> <li><i>E</i> is an integer (1 &le; <i>E</i> &le; 20) representing the number of extents the file occupies;</li> <li><i>A</i> and <i>B</i> (1 &le; <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> &le; <i>S</i>) are, respectively, the first and last blocks of the first extent the file occupies;</li> <li><i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> (1 &le; <i>X</i>, <i>Y</i> &le; <i>S</i>) are, if present, the first and last blocks of the second extent the file occupies;</li> <li>and so on;</li></ul></li><li>A line containing a single integer <i>P</i> (1 &le; <i>P</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of passes of RADDD that should be run.</ul><p><b>Output:</b><p>For each data set in the output, output the heading "<tt>DATA SET #<i>k</i></tt>" where <i>k</i> is 1 for the first data set, 2 for the second, and so on. On the next <i>C</i> lines, output the locations of the files on the disk after the RADDD passes in ascending order by the first block occupied on the disk. The format should be identical to the representation in the input; if a file occupies multiple extents, the output should be sorted in ascending order by the first block in each extent.<p><b>Sample Input:</b><pre>

The field makes the use of <i>Finite Impulse Response</i> (FIR) filters to make these effects happen.<p><p>Consider an input stream of samples, represented as a series of integers between 0 and 255 inclusive. (This is, you should not be surprised to discover, the range of an <i>8-bit</i> sample.) These samples come in a very specific sequence, one after the other, as the digital representation of a given waveform. A FIR mixer will take multiple streams and combine them into one, a FIR echo filter will take one input and provide a single output, and so on.<p>A FIR filter can be represented as an equation, with the input signals on one side and the output on the other. For example:<pre>
   Y = X[0] + X[-5]
</pre>represents an echo filter (more specifically, a post-echo filter); a given sample of Y is equal to the value of X at the same location in the input stream, plus the value of the sample that occurred five samples prior in X. Values that are not available (such as X[-5] for the first four samples of X) are set to 0.<p>In this problem, all FIR equations obey the following Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar:<p><table border="0" align="center"><tr><td><b><i>EQUATION</i></b></td><td><b><tt>::=</tt></b>&nbsp;</td><td><b><i>STREAM</b></i> &nbsp;__ &nbsp;"<tt>=</tt>"&nbsp; __&nbsp; <b><i>EXPR</b></i></td></tr><tr><td><b><i>STREAM</i></b></td><td><b><tt>::=</tt></b></td><td>A single upper-case letter representing a sample stream, such as  <tt>A</tt> or <tt>X</tt></td></tr><tr><td><b><i>EXPR</i></b></td><td><b><tt>::=</tt></b>&nbsp;</td><td><b><i>VALUE</i></b> &nbsp;|&nbsp; <b><i>SAMPLE</i></b> &nbsp;|&nbsp; <b><i>EXPR</i></b> &nbsp;__&nbsp; <b><i>OPER</i></b> &nbsp;__&nbsp; <b><i>EXPR</i></b> &nbsp;|&nbsp; "<tt>(</tt>" &nbsp;__&nbsp; <b><i>EXPR</i></b> &nbsp;__&nbsp; "<tt>)</tt>"</td></tr><tr><td><b><i>VALUE</i></b></td><td><b><tt>::=</tt></b></td><td>A floating-point number, such as <tt>0.25</tt>, <tt>5</tt>, or <tt>-1.5</tt></td></tr><tr><td><b><i>SAMPLE</i></b></td><td><b><tt>::=</tt></b>&nbsp;</td><td><b><i>STREAM</i></b> &nbsp;"<tt>[</tt>"&nbsp; </tt><b><i>OFFSET</i></b> &nbsp;"<tt>]</tt>"</td></tr><tr><td><b><i>OFFSET</i></b></td><td><b><tt>::=</tt></b>&nbsp;</td><td>An integer representing the sample offset into the stream, such as <tt>0</tt>, <tt>1</tt>, or <tt>-5</tt>, between <tt>-100</tt> and <tt>100</tt> inclusive.</td><tr><td><b><i>OPER</i></b></td><td><b><tt>::=</tt></b>&nbsp;</td><td>"<tt>*</tt>"&nbsp; | &nbsp;"<tt>+</tt>"&nbsp; | &nbsp;"<tt>-</tt>"</td></tr></table><p>Operations are handled in the standard order of precedence (parentheses first, multiplication before addition and subtraction, otherwise left-to-right), and the resulting value is rounded <i>down</i> to the nearest integer between 0 and 255 only <i>after</i> all calculations (if any) are done by the FIR filter. The __ symbol in the above grammar specifies a series of one or more spaces. Note that whitespace in an equation is only allowed where explicitly specified by the above grammar.<p>For example, a simple low-pass filter could be expressed as:<pre>
   Z = 0.5 * Y[0] + 0.25 * Y[-1] + 0.25 * Y[1]
</pre>Each output value of Z is based on the matching value in Y, modified by the nearest values of Y. A simple mixer can be represented as follows:<pre>
   D = C[0] + B[0]
</pre>although the clipping problems that such a filter would have should be apparent.<p>Obviously, for complicated effects, a number of filters can be connected together. In this problem, this is represented by <i><b>STREAM</b></i>; any relevant stream will either be an input value (the source audio, for example) or the output of a single FIR filter. However, a stream may be <i>used</i> as an input by more than one other filter. This constitutes a <i>filter network</i>.<p>Given a series of definitions of FIR filters and starting inputs, your task is to provide all of the outputs of the various filters. No FIR filter will have more than 10 operators or more than ten pairs of parentheses, nor will its representation use more than 80 characters. There will be at least one input stream and at least one output stream per data set, and all streams referenced in a filter equation will be defined in the same data set. All input streams and output streams will have the same number of samples, and there will be no "feedback loops" described by a filter network; that is, no filter will have input dependent on its output.<p>Although they sure sound cool when Pete Townshend uses them.<p><b>Input:</b><p>Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer <i>D</i> (1 &le; <i>D</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of data sets.

Recently, some folks have started building structures out of Stick-Tite blocks ("They stick ... tight!"), pressing them between two sheets of perspex, and dunking them in water.<p>Yeah, I don't know either.<p>Stick-Tite blocks are one inch cubes of some sort of material that is permeable to air but not water. They stick quite nicely to each other when properly aligned, such that it's delightfully easy to make any sort of nice pixel-esque structure. They also stick well (but not <i>too</i> well) to perspex (also known as Plexiglas(tm)).<p>When dunked underwater and shaken about a bit, water fills the open space in a Stick-Tite construction such that any open spaces are filled unless they are completely enclosed inside the construction. While Stick-Tite blocks are water-impermeable, water can fill from any open space to any other open space that is orthogonally <i>or diagonally</i> adjacent.<table border="1" align="center"><tr><td><pre>

At the top, water can come through the blocks (represented by <tt>X</tt>es) to fill the top chamber. At the bottom, water would not be able to flow between the two areas unless they were connected elsewhere.<p>After being dunked and wiggled, the Stick-Tite construction is pulled straight out of the water. Water drains out from any holes in the bottom or sides of the construction, coming out of all internal chambers and passages until the water level is even with the bottom of holes in the sides of chambers. In addition, due to static water pressure, the height of water in any pool still connected after this draining will never be higher than the bottom of the lowest hole that the pool's water can flow from.<pre>

</pre>In the above example, the tildes represent the maximum amount of water that the center pool can hold; while the left side has a hole one unit higher than the right side, the water level for the pool as a whole cannot be higher than the one on the right side. The act of draining pools may make a pool of water into smaller, separate pools; these would then drain independently.<pre>

Sometimes the scripts have the NPCs attempting to walk through walls and other barriers or even off the edge of the map. When this occurs, all of the steps of movement that would put the NPC in such an invalid location are converted into <tt>PAUSE</tt>s. For example, given this small snippet of a town:<pre>
...#
.1.#
...#
</pre>if the NPC represented by the 1 had <tt>EAST 5</tt> as their next command, that would be converted on the fly to <tt>EAST 1</tt> followed by <TT>PAUSE 4</tt>. This processing must be done before determining whether a script is <i>cyclic</i> or <i>reversible</i>.<p>A script is <i>cyclic</i> if, at the end of the script, the NPC back in their starting position. This sort of script is simply looped indefinitely. The other type of script is <i>reversible</i>; if, at the end of the script, the NPC is <i>not</i> back in their starting position, they then run a reversed copy of the script, with directions switched (<tt>WEST</tt> becomes <tt>EAST</tt>, <tt>EAST</tt> becomes <tt>WEST</tt>, <tt>NORTH</tt> becomes <tt>SOUTH</tt>, and <tt>SOUTH</tt> becomes <tt>NORTH</tt>) and <tt>PAUSE</tt>s intact. The end result is the character returning to their starting location.<table border="1" align="center"><tr><td>Original script segment</td><td>Reversed script segment</td></tr><tr><td><tt>SOUTH 1<br />PAUSE 5<br />EAST 1 </tt></td><td><tt>WEST 1<br />PAUSE 5<br />NORTH 1 </tt></td></tr></table><p>For the sake of this problem, you can assume that no NPCs will ever attempt to occupy the same location on the map at the same time, although one may enter a location on the same turn as a different NPC leaves it, which is valid behavior.<p>The simulation starts at turn 0; your task is to show, given a map and set of NPCs with their scripts, what the simulation looks like after a large number of turns have passed.<p><b>Input:</b><p>Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of data sets.

Some of the best writers will spend time researching the relevant scientific fields of today to make their futuristic technology seem believable to a modern day audience. As a budding young writer participating in the National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) in November, you'd like to do some technological research as well to make sure your own SF universe is up to par.<p>In your own SF novel, humanity has spread out throughout the galaxy and has come to colonize many a planet. Aside from the obvious requirement of interstellar space flight in your book, you'd like to keep all other technologies, computers especially, similar to what is available in today's world. That means the computer networks on many of the colonized planets will still be designed by running copper or fiber optic cable between the computers.<p>Modern computer networks use packet switching which means that you do <b>not</b> have to physically run a separate cable between every pair of computers. It's enough that the computer network remains <i>strongly connected</i>. In other words, it's enough that for every pair of computers on the network, some path exists such that packets traveling to and fro between the computers can reach their destinations by being forwarded through any number of computers in-between.<p>This property of packet switching allows us to minimize how much cable has to be laid down to allow every computer on the network to communicate with every other. As a budding SF writer, you'd like to know the absolute minimum total length of cable that would be required to create a computer network between all the cities on your newly colonized planet, assuming there are no redundant or aggregate links in the network. When performing your calculations, you may assume that the planet is a perfect sphere, all the cables are run along the surface of the planet, and that no surface obstructions (like rivers or mountain ranges) exist to impede the run of cable.<p>The input to this problem will specify the diameter of the planet in question, and it will include a list of city coordinates given in degrees of <i>latitude</i> and <i>longitude</i>. For those who are not as cartographically savvy as they'd like, latitude is an angular measurement ranging from &minus;90&deg; at the South pole to +90&deg; at the North pole and with 0&deg; located at a planet's <i>equator</i>. Longitude is an angular measurement ranging between &minus;180&deg; and +180&deg; with 0&deg; specifying the <i>prime meridian</i>. By convention negative longitude represents locations to the West of the prime meridian, and positive longitude presents locations to the East.<p><b>Input:</b><p>Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of data sets. Each data set consists of the following components:<ul><li>A line containing a single decimal number <i>D</i> (1 &le; <i>D</i> &le; 1,000,000) specifying the diameter (in kilometers) of the planet in question. </li><li>A line containing a single decimal number <i>L</i> (1 &le; <i>L</i> &le; 1,000,000) giving the total length of cable (in kilometers) available for building a network on the newly colonized planet. </li><li>A line containing a single integer <i>C</i> (1 &le; <i>C</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of cities this planet contains. </li><li>A series of <i>C</i> lines, each of which contains two decimal numbers of the form "<i>X</i> <i>Y</i>" respectively specifying the latitude and longitude (both in degrees) of one city with (&minus;90 &le; <i>X</i> &le; 90) and (&minus;180 &le; <i>X</i> &le; 180). </li></ul><p><b>Output:</b><p>For each data set in the input, print a single line. Print either "<tt>IS POSSIBLE</tt>" if the available length of cable <i>L</i> is enough to network all the cities, or print "<tt>IS NOT POSSIBLE</tt>" if the available length of cable <i>L</i> is too short.<p><b>Sample Input:</b><p><pre>

Time travel can only be done by moving through wormholes that connect two specific instances of time together. As a result, an agent must travel through several wormholes in sequence to reach his or her destination time. In addition, an agent may have to spend some time living in the past or future while waiting for the next wormhole to appear. Traveling through a wormhole also isn't as simple as it might seem: moving forward in time through a wormhole will instanteously age the user by a certain number of years and moving backwards through one will instanteously make the traveller slightly younger.<p>Because the agency pays its agents based on how many years they've aged since joining the service, you are required to minimize the "aging process" as much as possible for every agent. Your goal therefore is to write a program that finds the optimal itinerary of wormhole jumps for each agent's mission and then reports the total number of years each agent will age after completing their assignment.<p>For agency accounting purposes, the formulas for computing total years aged on a mission are as follows:<p><ul class="example"><li>When starting from some year of <i>origin</i> and simply waiting until some <i>destination</i> year, the age a body accumulates in years equals:<p align="center"><i>destination</i> - <i>origin</i><p>In other words, if you were currently in the year 1785 and had to wait until the year 1793, then you will have aged 8 years. </li><li>When traveling forward in time through a wormhole that connects one year of <i>departure</i> with a later year of <i>arrival</i>, then the number of years a body ages is equal to:<p align="center">floor((<i>arrival</i> - <i>departure</i>) / 2)<p>Put in another way, you will age half the number of years (rounded down) you normally would have had you instead waited for the equivalent number of years to pass by. Note that when traveling over a small enough time difference, the years aged may be rounded down to zero for accounting purposes. </li><li>When traveling backward in time through a wormhole that connects one year of <i>departure</i> with an earlier year of <i>arrival</i>, then the number of years a body "gains back" by becoming younger is equal to:<p align="center">floor((<i>departure</i> - <i>arrival</i>) / 4)</p>In other words, you gain back a quarter of the difference between the two years (rounded down). Note that when traveling over a small enough time difference, the years "gained back" may be rounded down to zero for accounting purposes. </li><li>A wormhole that starts and ends at the same year is possible, but causes no aging or time travel, and as such serves little purpose other than to confound the scientists.</li></ul>Each dataset to this problem will contain a starting year from which all agents begin their travels and a list of mission assignments, one for each agent. Every mission assignment includes a final destination year that the agent must travel to. The mission can only be completed if the agent is able to make a round trip by traveling from the starting year to the mission's destination year and then traveling back to the initial starting year again. If such a round trip cannot be completed, then that particular mission is invalid. For the purposes of this problem, you also do not have to consider the maximum lifespan of any given agent. A mission is considered valid as long as a round trip is possible regardless of how high the count of years aged will be.<p><b>Input:</b><p>Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of data sets. Each data set consists of the following components:<ul><li>A line containing a single integer <i>W</i> (1 &le; <i>W</i> &le; 100) specifying the number of wormholes present for this dataset. </li><li>A series of <i>W</i> lines of the form "<i>D</i> <i>A</i>" (1 &le; <i>D</i>, <i>A</i> &le; 9999), each of which describes a single wormhole. The numbers <i>D</i> and <i>A</i> respectively specify the <i>departure</i> and <i>arrival</i> years of the wormhole's two endpoints in time. A wormhole is unidirectional allowing travel only from its departure year to its arrival year, but not vice-versa. </li><li>A line containing a single integer <i>S</i> (1 &le; <i>S</i> &le; 9999) which is the starting year for all agents. </li><li>A line containing a single integer <i>M</i> (1 &le; <i>M</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of missions to be analyzed. </li><li>A series of <i>M</i> lines, each containing a single integer <i>F</i> (1 &le; <i>F</i> &le; 9999) which specifies the final destination year for each of the <i>M</i> missions. </li></ul><p><b>Output:</b><p>For each data set in the input, output the heading "<tt>DATA SET #<i>k</i></tt>" where <i>k</i> is 1 for the first data set, 2 for the second, and so on.

However, it is notoriously bug-ridden. You've been asked to replace Kyle (who quit the devteam) and help with fixing some of the bugs.<p>The main problem with the current release of <tt>td</tt>, as it is commonly referred to, is that it cannot differentiate between text on a line and commands. Whenever a user wants to type an <tt>x</tt>, the editor interprets it as a command to delete the last character. This is problematic. Thankfully, commands are case-sensitive, and each letter is at most a single command (sometimes uppercase, sometimes lowercase), so one can manage to write any given line of text as long as it's allowed to look like something written by a fourteen-year-old hacker wannabe.<p>Editing occurs in an <i>edit buffer</i>, which starts out empty. The cursor in <tt>td</tt> rests in <i>gaps</i>, locations surrounding each printed character. When a non-command character is entered, the character is inserted to the right of the cursor's current location and the cursor moves to the gap to the right of the new character. (This is the standard behavior of most editors.) A line with no characters has a single gap. A line with a single printable character has two (one before and one after), a line with two printable characters has three, and so on.<p>The currently-implemented commands are:<table border="1" align="center"><tr><td>Command keys</td><td>Result</td><td>Cursor location after operation</td></tr><tr><td><tt>x</tt></td><td>Delete the character immediately to the left of the cursor</td><td>One gap to the left</td></tr><tr><td><tt>K</tt></td><td>Delete all non-spaces to the left of the cursor, stopping at the first space encountered or the beginning of the line; if the previous character is a space, delete nothing</td><td>The gap to the right of the "stop" character</td></tr><tr><td><tt>c</tt></td><td>Duplicate the character to the left of the cursor, inserting it to the right of the cursor</td><td>The gap to the right of the duplicate character (one right)</td></tr><tr><td><tt>D</tt></td><td>Duplicate all non-spaces to the left of the cursor, stopping at the first space encountered or the beginning of the line and inserting them to the right of the cursor; if the previous character is a space, duplicate nothing</td><td>The gap to the right of the rightmost duplicate character</td></tr><tr><td><tt>R</tt></td><td>Reverse all non-spaces to the left of the cursor, stopping at the first space encountered or the beginning of the line; if the previous character is a space, reverse nothing</td><td>No change</td></tr><tr><td><tt>p</tt></td><td>Delete all characters to the left of the cursor</td><td>Leftmost gap</td></tr><tr><td><tt>W</tt></td><td>Delete all characters to the right of the cursor</td><td>No change</td></tr><tr><td><tt>h</tt></td><td>Move the cursor one gap to the left</td><td>One gap to the left</td></tr><tr><td><tt>L</tt></td><td>Move the cursor one gap to the right</td><td>One gap to the right</td></tr><tr><td><tt>f</tt></td><td>Move the cursor to the first gap on the line</td><td>Leftmost gap</td></tr><tr><td><tt>G</tt></td><td>Move the cursor to the last gap on the line</td><td>Rightmost gap</td></tr><tr><td><i>any non-command character</i></td><td>Insert the character into the edit buffer to the right of the cursor</td><td>One gap to the right</td></tr></table>For the purposes of this problem, the only characters are uppercase and lowercase characters, digits, and spaces.<p>When a character is added internally to a line of text, all subsequent characters shift to the right (as in "insert mode"); when characters are deleted from anywhere other than the end of a line, all subsequent characters shift to the left.<p>Any commands which cannot properly do anything (attempting to move past the first or last gap, deleting characters when none exist, and so on) do nothing.

He is extremely good at sophisticated visualization tools, but yet his favorite is a simple self-made histogram generator.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="563" HEIGHT="421" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4157.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p4157.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1: A histogram</DIV><P>Figure 1 is an example of histogram automatically produced by his histogram generator. A histogram is a visual display of frequencies of value occurrences as bars. In this example, values in the interval 0-9 occur five times, those in the interval 10-19 occur three times, and 20-29 and 30-39 once each.<P>Dr. Grey's histogram generator is a simple tool. First, the height of the histogram is fixed, that is, the height of the highest bar is always the same and those of the others are automatically adjusted proportionately. Second, the widths of bars are also fixed. It can only produce a histogram of uniform intervals, that is, each interval of a histogram should have the same width (10 in the above example). Finally, the bar for each interval is painted in a grey color, where the colors of the leftmost and the rightmost intervals are black and white, respectively, and the darkness of bars monotonically decreases at the same rate from left to right. For instance, in Figure 1, the darkness levels of the four bars are 1, 2/3, 1/3, and 0, respectively.<P>In this problem, you are requested to estimate ink consumption when printing a histogram on paper. The amount of ink necessary to draw a bar is proportional to both its area and darkness.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of multiple datasets, each of which contains integers and specifies a value table and intervals for the histogram generator, in the following format.<P><P><BR><TABLE COLS=2><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COL ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="27" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4157.jpg ALT="$ \vdots$"></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I><SUB>n</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></TD><TD></TD></TR></TABLE><P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the total number of value occurrences for the histogram, and each of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> lines following the first line contains a single value.

<P>
In the middle of Tyrrhenian Sea, there is a small volcanic island called Chronus. The island is now uninhabited but it used to be a civilized island. Some historical records imply that the island was annihilated by an eruption of a volcano about 800 years ago and that most of the people in the island were killed by pyroclastic flows caused by the volcanic activity. In 2003, a European team of archaeologists launched an excavation project in Chronus Island. Since then, the project has provided many significant historic insights. In particular the discovery made in the summer of 2008 astonished the world: the project team excavated several mechanical watches worn by the victims of the disaster. This indicates that people in Chronus Island had such a highly advanced manufacturing technology. 

<P>
Shortly after the excavation of the watches, archaeologists in the team tried to identify what time of the day the disaster happened, but it was not successful due to several diffculties. First, the extraordinary heat of pyroclastic flows severely damaged the watches and took away the letters and numbers printed on them. Second, every watch has a perfect round form and one cannot tell where the top of the watch is. Lastly, though every watch has three hands, they have a completely identical look and therefore one cannot tell which is the hour, the minute, or the second (It is a mystery how the people in Chronus Island were distinguishing the three hands. Some archaeologists guess that the hands might be painted with different colors, but this is only a hypothesis, as the paint was lost by the heat). This means that we cannot decide the time indicated by a watch uniquely; there can be a number of candidates. We have to consider different rotations of the watch. Furthermore, since there are several possible interpretations of hands, we have also to consider all the permutations of hands. 

<P>
You are an information archaeologist invited to the project team and are asked to induce the most plausible time interval within which the disaster happened, from the set of excavated watches. 

<P>
In what follows, we express a time modulo 12 hours. We write a time by the notation <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>hh</I> : <I>mm</I> : <I>ss</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>hh</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>mm</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ss</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> stand for the hour <!-- MATH
 $(hh = 00, 01, 02, \ldots, 11)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>hh</I> = 00, 01, 02,..., 11)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the minute <!-- MATH
 $(mm = 00, 01, 02, \ldots, 59)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>mm</I> = 00, 01, 02,..., 59)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and the second <!-- MATH
 $(ss = 00, 01, 02, \ldots, 59)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>ss</I> = 00, 01, 02,..., 59)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, respectively. The time starts from 00:00:00 and counts up every second 00:00:00, 00:00:01, 00:00:02, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUP> ... </SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, but it reverts to 00:00:00 every 12 hours. 

<P>
The watches in Chronus Island obey the following conventions of modern analog watches. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>A watch has three hands, i.e. the hour hand, the minute hand, and the second hand, though they look identical as mentioned above.
</LI>
<LI>Every hand ticks 6 degrees clockwise in a discrete manner. That is, no hand stays between ticks, and each hand returns to the same position every 60 ticks. 
</LI>
<LI>The second hand ticks every second. 
</LI>
<LI>The minute hand ticks every 60 seconds. 
</LI>
<LI>The hour hand ticks every 12 minutes. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
At the time 00:00:00, all the three hands are located at the same position. 

<P>
Because people in Chronus Island were reasonably keen to keep their watches correct and pyroclastic flows spread over the island quite rapidly, it can be assumed that all the watches were stopped in a short interval of time. Therefore it is highly expected that the time the disaster happened is in the shortest time interval within which all the excavated watches have at least one candidate time. 

<P>
You must calculate the shortest time interval and report it to the project team.

Note that the positions of the hands of a watch can be expressed in many different ways. For example, if a watch was stopped at the time 11:55:03, the positions of hands can be expressed differently by rotating the watch arbitrarily (e.g. 59 55 3, 0 56 4, 1 57 5, etc.) and as well by permuting the hour, minute, and second hands arbitrarily (e.g. 55 59 3, 55 3 59, 3 55 59, etc.).

<P>
In calculating the shortest interval, you can exploit the facts that every watch has at least one candidate time and that the shortest time interval contains 00:00:00 only if the interval starts from 00:00:00 (i.e. the shortest interval terminates before the time reverts to 00:00:00). 

<P>
If there is more than one time interval that gives the shortest, output the one that first comes after 00:00:00 inclusive.

Taro attempts to tell digits to Hanako by putting straight bars on the floor. Taro wants to express each digit by making one of the forms shown in Figure 2. 

<P>
Since Taro may not have bars of desired lengths, Taro cannot always make forms exactly as shown in Figure 2. Fortunately, Hanako can recognize a form as a digit if the connection relation between bars in the form is kept. Neither the lengths of bars nor the directions of forms affect Hanako's perception as long as the connection relation remains the same. For example, Hanako can recognize all the awkward forms in Figure 3 as digits. On the other hand, Hanako cannot recognize the forms in Figure 4 as digits. For clarity, touching bars are slightly separated in Figures 2, 3 and 4. Actually, touching bars overlap exactly at one single point.

In the forms, when a bar touches another, the touching point is an end of at least one of them. That is, bars never cross. In addition, the angle of such two bars is always a right angle. 

<P>
To enable Taro to represent forms with his limited set of bars, positions and lengths of bars can be changed as far as the connection relations are kept. Also, forms can be rotated. 

<P>
Keeping the connection relations means the following.

Your task is to find how many times each digit appears on the floor. The forms of some digits always contain the forms of other digits. For example, a form for 9 always contains four forms for 1, one form for 4, and two overlapping forms for 7. In this problem, ignore the forms contained in another form and count only the digit of the ``largest" form composed of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">all</SPAN> mutually connecting bars. If there is one form for 9, it should be interpreted as one appearance of 9 and no appearance of 1, 4, or 7.

<P>On a small planet named Bandai, a landing party of the starship Tadamigawa discovered colorful cubes traveling on flat areas of the planet surface, which the landing party named <SPAN CLASS="textit">beds</SPAN>. A cube appears at a certain position on a bed, travels on the bed for a while, and then disappears. After a longtime observation, a science officer Lt.

<P>The amount of information on the World Wide Web is growing quite rapidly. In this information explosion age, we must survive by accessing only the Web pages containing information relevant to our own needs. One of the key technologies for this purpose is keyword search. By using well-known search engines, we can easily access those pages containing useful information about the topic we want to know.<P>There are many variations in keyword search problems. If a single string is searched in a given text, the problem is quite easy. If the pattern to be searched consists of multiple strings, or is given by some powerful notation such as regular expressions, the task requires elaborate algorithms to accomplish efficiently.<P>In our problem, a number of strings (<SPAN CLASS="textit">element strings</SPAN>) are given, but they are not directly searched for. Concatenations of all the element strings in any order are the targets of the search here.<P>For example, consider three element strings <TT>aa</TT>, <TT>b</TT> and <TT>ccc</TT> are given. In this case, the following six concatenated strings are the targets of the search, i.e. they should be searched in the text.<P><P><BR><PRE>

<P>
Spinning tops are one of the most popular and the most traditional toys. Not only spinning them, but also making one's own is a popular enjoyment. 

<P>
One of the easiest way to make a top is to cut out a certain shape from a cardboard and pierce an axis stick through its center of mass. Professionally made tops usually have three dimensional shapes, but in this problem we consider only two dimensional ones. 

<P>
Usually, tops have rotationally symmetric shapes, such as a circle, a rectangle (with 2-fold rotational symmetry) or a regular triangle (with 3-fold symmetry). Although such symmetries are useful in determining their centers of mass, they are not definitely required; an asymmetric top also spins quite well if its axis is properly pierced at the center of mass. 

<P>
When a shape of a top is given as a path to cut it out from a cardboard of uniform thickness, your task is to find its center of mass to make it spin well. Also, you have to determine whether the center of mass is on the part of the cardboard cut out. If not, you cannot pierce the axis stick, of course.

<P>
The input consists of multiple datasets, each of which describes a counterclockwise path on a cardboard to cut out a top. A path is indicated by a sequence of command lines, each of which specifies a line segment or an arc. 

<P>
In the description of commands below, the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">current position</SPAN> is the position to start the next cut, if any. After executing the cut specified by a command, the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">current position</SPAN> is moved to the end position of the cut made.

Given several points on a plane, let's try to solve a puzzle connecting them with a zigzag line. The puzzle is to find the zigzag line that passes through all the given points with the minimum number of turns. Moreover, when there are several zigzag lines with the minimum number of turns, the shortest one among them should be found. 

<P>
For example, consider nine points given in Figure 10.

Rather than flying, the Lampyridae Teleportae teleports from spot to spot by warping space-time. When it stops between teleports, it hovers for a moment and flashes its light in search of a mate. So, even though they only come out after dark, it's easy to observe them, but very difficult to catch them. Fortunately for the Association for Catching Lampyridae (ACL), student members of the Association for Cool Machinery (ACM) recently developed the world's first teleporting tennis shoes. The tennis shoes are efficient enough that, when a Lampyridae Teleportae is spotted by its flash, there is always time to teleport once before the firefly itself teleports off to another location, but there is never time to teleport twice in a row before the firefly teleports away. The tennis shoes have a maximum teleport range, however, depending on how well their flux capacitor is constructed, so it's not always possible to catch a Lampyridae Teleportae with just a single teleport. The most efficient catching method is to remain in place until a firefly flashes, and to then teleport in a straight line directly toward it, subject to the limitation of the maximum range of ones tennis shoes, in an attempt to get close enough to catch it. If you don't get close enough, you wait for the next flash, teleport towards it again, and repeat, until you either catch it or it's gone.</p><p>For this programming problem you will simulate this procedure for catching teleporting fireflies with a few simplifying assumptions: (1) We will be chasing only one firefly at a time. (2) Firefly chasing will take place in two dimensions where all units are considered to be yards. (3) The firefly is "caught" if the chaser can manage to come within one yard of the firefly. (4) The chaser's movement toward a firefly is always in a straight line from his or her current location directly toward the flash; if the range of the chaser's tennis shoes prevents getting close enough to catch the firefly, the chaser will always teleport the maximum range possible (thus, although the chaser always starts at integer coordinates, it is possible and likely that any or all of the chaser's locations after the first teleport will be at non-integer coordinates).<p><p>The input will consist of several chase scenarios. For each scenario you will be given the maximum range in yards of the chaser's teleporting tennis shoes, the chaser's starting location, and a list of one or more flash locations for the firefly being chased. For each chase scenario your program will output a single line indicating either the flash location where the firefly was caught, or a message noting that the firefly was never caught.<p><p><b>Input:</b> The first line of a chase scenario contains three numbers, delimited by a single space, in the following order: the maximum range in yards of the chaser's teleporting tennis shoes, the starting x-coordinate of the chaser, and the starting y-coordinate of the chaser. The maximum range will be a positive integer from 1 to 1000. The x and y values for the starting coordinates will be integers from 0 to 1000. The remaining lines of an input scenario contain two integers each, an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate, again delimited by a single space. These are, in order of appearance, the locations where the firefly flashes. All coordinate values range from 0 to 1000. A line specifying a value of -1 for both x and y terminates the list, at which point we consider the firefly to disappear never to be seen again. Note that a firefly might be caught at a flash location prior to end of the list; in this case the rest of the flash locations listed in the input for the current chase scenario should simply be ignored.</p><p>The next input scenario begins on the line immediately after the last line of the preceding scenario. An input scenario that specifies 0 (zero) as the maximum range of the chaser will terminate the input.</p><p><b>Output:</b> Every output line will be either: (1) "Firefly N caught at (x,y)", where N is the input scenario number starting with 1, and (x,y) is the last location the firefly flashed before it was caught; or (2) "Firefly N not caught".</p><table border="1" cellpadding="10"><thead><tr><td><b>Example Input:</b></td><td><b>Example Output:</b></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="font-family: monospace; letter-spacing: 2px;"><pre>2 0 0

Consider continuous paths going through each tile exactly once, with each successive tile being an immediate neighbor of the previous tile. The object is to choose such a path so the sequence of characters on the tiles makes an <span style="font-style: italic;">acceptable</span> equation, according to the restrictions listed below. A sequence is illustrated in each figure above. In Figure 1, if you follow the gray path from the top, the character sequence is"6/3=9-7". Similarly, in Figure 2, start from the bottom left 3 to get "3*21+10=73".</p><p>There are a lot of potential paths through a moderate sized hex tile pattern. A puzzle player may get frustrated and want to see the answer. Your task is to automate the solution.</p><p>The arrangement of hex tiles and choices of characters in each puzzle satisfy these rules:</p><ol></ol><ol><li>The hex pattern has an odd number of rows greater than 2. The odd numbered rows will all contain the same number of tiles. Even numbered rows will have one more hex tile than the odd numbered rows and these longer even numbered rows will stick out both to the left and the right of the odd numbered rows.</li><li>There is exactly one '=' in the hex pattern.</li><li>There are no more than two '*' characters in the hex pattern.</li><li>There will be fewer than 14 total tiles in the hex pattern.</li><li>With the restrictions on allowed character sequences described below, there will be a unique acceptable solution in the hex pattern.</li></ol><ol></ol><p>To have an acceptable solution from the characters in some path, the expressions on each side of the equal sign must be in acceptable form and evaluate to the same numeric value. The following rules define acceptable form of the expressions on each side of the equal sign and the method of expression evaluation:</p><ul></ul><ol start="6"><li>The operators '+', '-', '*', and '/' are only considered as binary operators, so no character sequences where '+' or '-' would be a unary operator are acceptable. For example "-2*3=-6" and "1 =5+-4" are not acceptable.</li><li>The usual precedence of operations is not used. Instead all operations have equal precedence and operations are carried out from left to right. For example "44-4/2=2+3*4" is acceptable and "14=2+3*4" is not acceptable.</li><li>If a division operation is included, the equation can only be acceptable if the division operation works out to an exact integer result. For example "10/5=12/6" and "7+3/5=3*4/6" are acceptable. "5/2*4=10" is not acceptable because the sides would only be equal with exact mathematical calculation including an intermediate fractional result. "5/2*4=8" is not acceptable because the sides of the equation would only be equal if division were done with truncation.</li><li>At most two digits together are acceptable. For example, "123+1 = 124" is not acceptable.</li><li>A character sequences with a '0' directly followed by another digit is not acceptable. For example, "3*05=15" is not acceptable.</li></ol><ul></ul><p>With the assumptions above, an acceptable expression will never involve an intermediate or final arithmetic result with magnitude over three million.</p><p><b>Input:</b> The input will consist of one to fifteen data sets, followed by a line containing only 0.</p><p>The first line of a dataset contains blank separated integers <span style="font-style: italic;">r&nbsp;c</span>, where <span style="font-style: italic;">r</span> is the number of rows in the hex pattern and <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span> is the number of entries in the odd numbered rows.

One of the training exercises is to cross a series of rope bridges set high in the trees. Every bridge has a maximum capacity, which is the number of people that the bridge can support without breaking. The goal is to cross the bridges as quickly as possible, subject to the following tactical requirements:</p><dl><dt><i>One unit at a time!</i></dt><dd>If two or more people can cross a bridge at the same time (because they do not exceed the capacity), they do so as a unit; they walk as close together as possible, and they all take a step at the same time. It is never acceptable to have two different units on the same bridge at the same time, even if they don't exceed the capacity. Having multiple units on a bridge is not tactically sound, and multiple units can cause oscillations in the rope that slow everyone down. This rule applies even if a unit contains only a single person.</dd><dt><i>Keep moving!</i></dt><dd>When a bridge is free, as many people as possible begin to cross it as a unit. Note that this strategy doesn't always lead to an optimal overall crossing time (it may be faster for a group to wait for people behind them to catch up so that more people can cross at once). But it is not tactically sound for a group to wait, because the people they're waiting for might not make it, and then they've not only wasted time but endangered themselves as well.</dd></dl><p>Periodically the bridges are reconfigured to give the trainees a different challenge. Given a bridge configuration, your job is to calculate the minimum amount of time it would take a group of people to cross all the bridges subject to these requirements.</p><p>For example, suppose you have nine people who must cross two bridges: the first has capacity 3 and takes 10 seconds to cross; the second has capacity 4 and takes 60 seconds to cross. The initial state can be represented as (9&nbsp;0&nbsp;0), meaning that 9 people are waiting to cross the first bridge, no one is waiting to cross the second bridge, and no one has crossed the last bridge. At 10 seconds the state is (6&nbsp;3&nbsp;0). At 20 seconds the state is (3&nbsp;3&nbsp;/3:50/&nbsp;0), where /3:50/ means that a unit of three people is crossing the second bridge and has 50 seconds left. At 30 seconds the state is (0&nbsp;6&nbsp;/3:40/&nbsp;0); at 70 seconds it's (0&nbsp;6&nbsp;3); at 130 seconds it's (0&nbsp;2&nbsp;7); and at 190 seconds it's (0&nbsp;0&nbsp;9). Thus the total minimum time is 190 seconds.</p><p><b>Input:</b> The input consists of one or more bridge configurations, followed by a line containing two zeros that signals the end of the input. Each bridge configuration begins with a line containing a negative integer &ndash;B and a positive integer P, where B is the number of bridges and P is the total number of people that must cross the bridges. Both B and P will be at most 20. (The reason for putting &ndash;B in the input file is to make the first line of a configuration stand out from the remaining lines.) Following are B lines, one for each bridge, listed in order from the first bridge that must be crossed to the last. Each bridge is defined by two positive integers C and T, where C is the capacity of the bridge (the maximum number of people the bridge can hold), and T is the time it takes to cross the bridge (in seconds). C will be at most 5, and T will be at most 100. Only one unit, of size at most C, can cross a bridge at a time; the time required is always T, regardless of the size of the unit (since they all move as one). The end of one bridge is always close to the beginning of the next, so the travel time between bridges is zero.</p><p><b>Output:</b> For each bridge configuration, output one line containing the minimum amount of time it will take (in seconds) for all of the people to cross all of the bridges while meeting both tactical requirements.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="10"><thead><tr><td><b>Example input:</b></td><td><b>Example output:</b></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="font-family: monospace;">-1 2<br>5 17<br>-1 8<br>3 25<br>-2 9<br>3 10<br>4 60<br>-3 10<br>2 10<br>3 30<br>2 15<br>-4 8<br>1 8<br>4 30<br>2 10<br>1 12<br>0 0</td><td style="font-family: monospace;" valign="top">17<br>75<br>190<br>145<br>162</td></tr></tbody></table><p><small><i>Last modified on October 22, 2008 at 10:24 PM.</i></small></p></body></html>

Several members agreed to clear off the old posters. They found posters plastered many levels deep. They made a bet about how much area was left clear, what was the greatest depth of posters on top of each other, and how much of the area was covered to this greatest depth. To determine each bet's winner, they made very accurate measurements of all the poster positions as they removed them. Because of the large number of posters, they now need a program to do the calculations. That is your job.</p><p>A simple illustration is shown above: a bulletin board 45 units wide by 40 high, with three posters, one with corners at coordinates (10, 10) and (35, 20), another with corners at (20, 25) and (40, 35), and the last with corners at (25, 5) and (30, 30).

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"><html><head><title>Serial Numbers</title> <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1"><meta name="Author" content="Ron Pacheco"></head><body style="background-color: white;" lang="EN-US"><h1 style="text-align: center;" align="center">Problem F: Serial Numbers</h1><center><table><tbody><tr><td>Source file:</td><td><tt>serials.</tt>{<tt>c</tt>, <tt>cpp</tt>, <tt>java</tt>}</td></tr><tr><td>Input file:</td><td><tt>serials.in</tt></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>A manufacturer keeps an ordered table of serial numbers by listing in each row of the table a range of serial numbers along with two corresponding pieces of information called the status code and the transfer code. A four-column table stores information about ranges of serial numbers in this order: starting serial number, ending serial number, status code, transfer code. Serial numbers as well as transfer codes are integers from 1 to 2<sup>31</sup>-1 (2<sup>31</sup>-1 = 2147483647), and status codes are a single upper-case letter. The table is maintained in increasing order of serial numbers, serial number ranges are never allowed to overlap, and for any given serial number, the table must always accurately represent the most recent data (status code and transfer code) for that serial number.</p><p>Let's say that 100,000 serial numbers are created with a status of "A" and a transfer code of "1". An entry for those serial numbers might look like this:</p><pre>1 100000 A 1</pre><p>This is obviously far more efficient than storing 100,000 individual rows all with the same status and transfer codes. The challenge arises when serial numbers within already defined ranges need to be given different status or transfer codes. For example, if serial number 12345 needs to change to status B, the above table would need to become three separate entries:</p><pre>1 12344 A 1
12345 12345 B 1
12346 100000 A 1</pre><p>Now let's change the transfer code of all serial numbers in the range 12000 to 12999 to 2. This gets us:</p><pre>1 11999 A 1
12000 12344 A 2
12345 12345 B 2
12346 12999 A 2
13000 100000 A 1</pre><p>Now change all existing serial numbers from 10000 to 100000 to status C and transfer code 2:</p><pre>1 9999 A 1
10000 100000 C 2</pre><p>Once created a serial number will never be deleted, but it is possible to have ranges of undefined serial numbers between ranges of defined ones. To demonstrate, let's now set all serial numbers from 1000000 to 1999999 to status Z and transfer code 99:</p><pre>1 9999 A 1
10000 100000 C 2
1000000 1999999 Z 99</pre><p>Finally, the table is always maintained with a minimal number of rows, meaning specifically that there will never be two adjacent rows in the table where one would suffice. For example, consider the following serial number table:</p><pre>1 10 A 1
11 20 A 1
21 30 B 1</pre><p>The first two rows could actually be represented by a single row, meaning that the table above does not have a minimal number of rows. The same data represented by a minimal number of rows would look like this:</p><pre>1 20 A 1
21 30 B 1</pre><p>The following table, however, because the first two rows have non-matching transfer codes, already contains the minimal number of rows:</p><pre>1 10 A 1
11 20 A 2
21 30 B 1</pre><p>Similarly, the following table cannot be reduced further because the first two rows do not represent a continuous series of serial numbers:</p><pre>1 10 A 1
12 20 A 1
21 30 B 1</pre><p><b>Input:</b> Each input case begins with a single line that is a character string naming the test case. This string contains at most 80 characters. The name "END" marks the end of the input. Following this will be 1 to 100 lines of the form "A B S T", where A, B, and T are integers in the range 1 to 2<sup>31</sup>-1, S is an uppercase letter, and A&lt;=B. These lines are, in the order they are to be applied, the serial number transactions to be recorded, where A is the start of the serial number range, B is the end of the serial number range, S is the status code, and T is the transfer code. The list of serial number transactions is terminated by a line containing only a 0 (zero) character.</p><p><b>Output:</b> For each input case, echo the test case name to the output on a line by itself, followed by the resulting minimal-rows serial number table that results after all serial number transactions have been applied.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="10"><thead><tr><td><b>Example Input:</b></td><td><b>Example Output:</b></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="font-family: monospace; letter-spacing: 2px;"><pre>First Example

The professor gives his students a map of the maze and a fixed amount of time to find the exit before he floods the maze with xerobiton particles, causing anyone still in the maze to be immediately inverted at the quantum level. Students who escape pass the course; those who don't are trapped forever in a parallel universe where the grass is blue and the sky is green.</p><p>The entrance and the exit are always at a junction as defined above. Knowing that clever ACM programming students will always follow the shortest possible path between two junctions, he chooses the entrance and exit junctions so that the distance that they have to travel is as far as possible. That is, he examines all pairs of junctions that have a path between them, and selects a pair of junctions whose shortest path distance is the longest possible for the maze (which he rebuilds every semester, of course, as the motivation to cheat on this exam is very high).</p><p>The joy he derives from quantumly inverting the majority of his students is marred by the tedium of computing the length of the longest of the shortest paths (he needs this to know to decide how much time to put on the clock), so he wants you to write a program to do it for him. He already has a program that generates the mazes, essentially just a random collection of line segments and circles. Your job is to take that collection of line segments and circles, determine the shortest paths between all the distinct pairs of junctions, and report the length of the longest one.</><p>The input to your program is the output of the program that generates his mazes. That program was written by another student, much like yourself, and it meets a few of the professor's specifications: 1) No endpoint of a line segment will lie on a circle; 2) No line segment will intersect a circle at a tangent; 3) If two circles intersect, they intersect at exactly two distinct points; 4) Every maze contains at least two junctions; that is, a minimum maze is either a single line segment, or two circles that intersect. There is, however, one bug in the program. (He would like to have it fixed, but unfortunately the student who wrote the code never gave him the source, and is now forever trapped in a parallel universe.) That bug is that the maze is not always entirely connected. There might be line segments or circles, or both, off by themselves that intersect nothing, or even little "submazes" composed of intersecting line segments and circles that as a whole are not connected to the rest of the maze. The professor insists that your solution account for this! The length that you report must be for a path between connected junctions!<p><p><b>Examples:</b><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4173a.png /></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4173a.png /></td></tr><!--<tr><td><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4173a.png /></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/41/p4173a.png /></td></tr>--><tr><td width="400px">Line segments only.

<P>John has recently arrived in Romania for the South Eastern European Regional competitions. John has never been to Romania before so Romanians decided to organize sightseeing tour for him. This tour will include several Romanian cities and none of them will be visited more than once. John will start in one city and will visit some other cities according to a guide tour.

<P>Mr. Tenant is going to buy a new house. In fact, he is going to buy a piece of land and build his new house on it. In order to decide which piece of land to buy, Mr. Tenant needs a program which will give a score to each piece. Each candidate piece of land is a polygonal shape (not necessarily convex), and Mr. Tenant wonders what the best score is. Among possible scores, he considered the number of vertices, sum of angles, minimum number of required guards, and so forth. Finally, Mr. Tenant decided that the best score for a piece of land would simply be its area. Your task is to write the desired scoring program.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input file consists of multiple pieces of land.

<P>Joe is fond of computer games. Now, he must solve a puzzling situation. In front of his eyes lies a huge map with fortified towns. His enemy is a very powerful and tricky character who can connect and disconnect the towns by giving some commands. Two towns are connected if they have been directly connected or interconnected through some other connected towns at some moment in time. When a town is disconnected it gets isolated and clears its own connection history, not the connection history of the other towns. Each connection is bi-directional. Initially the towns are isolated. Joe is asked to answer quickly if two towns are connected, according to the history of the character's commands.<P>Write a program which based on information input from a text file counts the number of yes answers and the number of no answers to questions of the kind: is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>town</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> connected with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>town</I><SUB>j</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>?<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The program reads data from a text file.

John has recently arrived in Bucharest for the South Eastern European Regional Contest. John is famous for his theory of lucky numbers. That's why all the contestants and spectators are very happy. 

<P>
According to that theory 4 and 7 are lucky digits, and all the other digits are not lucky. A lucky number is a number that contains only lucky digits in decimal notation. A very lucky number is a number that can be expressed as a product of several lucky numbers. A lucky number by itself is considered to be very lucky. For example, numbers 47, 49, 112 are very lucky. 

<P>
Your task is to calculate the number of very lucky numbers that are not less than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and not greater than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>

Others have argued that the size can be dramatically reduced by taking advantage of the fact that many words end in common suffixes. The trie can be scanned for common subtrees and the parents of identical subtrees could be altered so that they all point to a single instance of that subtree. Your job is to demonstrate this process. Write a program to find the shared subtree that would produce the maximum reduction in the number of nodes if all instances of that subtree were replaced by a single shared instance.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>Input consists of one or more lines, each line describing one tree.

You have some information from British Intelligence. First, the rail line is completely linear---there are no branches, no spurs. Next, British Intelligence has assigned a Strategic Importance to each depot---an integer from 1 to 5. A depot is of no use on its own, it only has value if it is connected to other depots. The Strategic Value of the entire railroad is calculated by adding up the products of the Strategic Values for every pair of depots that are connected, directly or indirectly, by the rail line.

The designers at Spark Plug Searching, Ltd., are searching for additional ways to reduce the size of the dictionary used for their new spell checker. Their latest idea is that maybe they can get by storing only the basic ``stem" form of a word without including the plural forms, past tenses, and other grammatical variants of the stem word. 

<P>

<P>
When a word is extracted from a document and we want to check it for correct spelling, we can apply a series of rules to rewrite the word to its likely stem form. Then we check the dictionary to see if that rewritten word matches any entry in the dictionary. 

<P>
Natural languages are pretty messy and it may take quite a bit of experimenting to get an appropriate set. So the team has proposed a simple language for describing rewrite rules. A rule has the form 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>pattern</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> =&gt; <!-- MATH
 $replacement$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>replacement</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark></TT>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
A <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>pattern</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is a sequence of one or more characters which are interpreted as follows: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Lower-case alphabetic characters in the pattern match a single occurrence of that same character in either upper or lower case. For example, a pattern ``ab" can match and ``ab", ``aB", ``Ab" or ``AB" in a word. 
</LI>
<LI>An asterisk (*) matches one or more alphabetic characters. There is at most one asterisk in a pattern, and if one is present it will be the first character in the pattern. 
</LI>
<LI>An upper-case 'V' matches any lower-case vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u').
</LI>
<LI>An upper-case 'C' matches any lower-case consonant (any alphabetic character other than 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'). 
</LI>
<LI>A numeric digit 1-9 matches the same string as was matched by the character in that position of the pattern, counting the first character of the pattern as character #1. A digit <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> can occur in the pattern only after position <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
For example, the pattern `<TT>*C2ies</TT>' would match any word of at least 6 characters ending in two copies of the same consonant followed by `<TT>ies</TT>'.

<P>
The <!-- MATH
 $replacement$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>replacement</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> part of a rule is built from a limited set of the same characters. Specifically, the replacement can contain only lower-case alphabetic characters (which are kept ``as is") and numeric digits, which are replaced by the same string they would have matched in the pattern. For example, the rule 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<TT>*C2ies =&gt; 122y</TT>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
applied to the word ``berries" would match the ``*" against ``be", the ``C" and ``2" against ``r", and the ``ies" against ``ies". In the replacement, the ``1" refers to the ``*" which matched ``be", the ``2"s each match ``r", and the ``y" is left as is, so the word ``berries" is rewritten to ``berry". 

<P>
Write a program to read a set of rewrite rules and to apply them to words in a paragraph of text. For each word (maximal consecutive string of alphabetic characters) in the paragraph, apply the rules, one at a time, in the order they are given, until a matching pattern is found or until all rules are exhausted. If a matching pattern is found, apply that rule to rewrite the word. If not, leave the word unchanged.

decide whether he can attend his meeting or not. Danny is busy with his wife

misses that if it overlaps or touches (For example, if Dannys time span with
his wife finishes at 18:00 and the meeting starts at 18:00 then the two
schedules conflict and Danny misses the meeting) the time scheduled for his

font-family:Verdana'>Whether a rectangle can be divided into small pieces of squares can itself be an interesting task to solve. But that is not the problem you have to solve here. Your job is to decide whether a square shaped sheet can be divided into four right-angled triangles as shown in figure 1. The machine that is used to cut the pieces can only deal with integers. So the length of the square shaped sheets is always expressed in integer units and also cutter can only cut in a straight line from one integer coordinate to another. The cutting must start on one of the corners of the square shaped sheet, continue cutting in a triangular path (Like AEF showed in Figure 1) and again finish at the corner it started. And if four corners of the square sheet are lattice points (0,0), (N,0), (N,N) and (0,N), where N is the length of sides of the square shaped sheet then point E and F should also be lattice points. So given a sheet, you have to determine whether such cuts are possible, and if it is possible then in how many ways. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><h5 style='text-align:justify'><span class=StyleArial16pt><span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Input</span></span><span class=StyleArial16pt><span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

font-family:Verdana;font-style:normal'>Dealing with chemicals is a risky job, particularly if it is reactive. Reactive chemicals can be dangerous if not stored in an appropriate environment. As a result, sophisticated instruments that can support real-time processing, is required while transferring a reactive chemical from one part of a chemical plant to another one. However, instruments that can ensure strictly real-time service, is too much costly &amp; hence chemical plants use networks that provide real-time transfer with some tolerance. <o:p></o:p></span></h1><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

In our concerned chemical plant, there are V pits. Pits are places where chemicals can be stored. In order to reduce cost, they are not facilitated with reactive chemical handling environment. So, for every second the reactive chemical stays in some of these pits, they are decayed by 1 milligram. The pits are numbered from 1 to V. There is a safe storage attached to pit S. No time is required to move to the storage from pit S. There is some reactive chemical weighing W milligram in pit 1 at time 0. This chemical is to be transported to the safe storage. Note that, the safe storage door is opened exactly at time T. So, if the chemical reaches the storage before time T, you will have to accept decaying of the chemical whereas if it reaches after time T, it can
not enter the safe storage. There are E transfer tubes in the network. The
transfer tubes have suitable environment for storing reactive chemicals inside
them. So, the chemicals are not decayed inside the tubes. Each transfer tube
connects two pits with an entry point in pit s and an exit point in pit d. For
each tube t, the entry point door is opened for any 1 second between time sst
&amp; sct (sst &#8804; sct) but we don't exactly know in which second it is
opened. Similarly, the exit point door is opened for any single second between
time dst &amp; dct (dst &#8804; dct). As you don't know the exact timing of the
doors' opening, if we want to move the chemical from pit s to pit d using tube
t, it must be available at pit s no later than time sst. If the chemical
reaches a particular pit x using tube y with exit point range dsy &amp; dcy
(dsy &#8804; dcy ) &amp; leaves this pit using tube z with entry point range
ssz &amp; scz (ssz &#8804; scz), the maximum possible decay in that pit is scz
 dsy. Please note that, while choosing the tube to get out from a pit, you
must always select a tube with it's opening interval beginning no sooner than
the latest possible time for the chemical to enter that pit. For instance, in
the 3rd sample test case, the chemical will always leave pit 2 using the 3rd
edge even if it reaches pit 2 at time 15.<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Creating a good and easy Graphical user interface is the
heart of operating a computer in modern days. One important part of this
interface is enabling users to give inputs using mouse and keyboard. Many
different types of forms are there to take inputs from users. Such as (a) Text
Box<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(b) Radio Button (c) Check Box (d)
Combo Box etc. In this problem we will concentrate on check box. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Check boxes are used when a user needs to select more than
one choice. Such a checkbox is shown in the figure on the left below.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The problem with checkbox is that when
someone has to choose n options or names he has to make n clicks, which can be
very annoying when n is high. So the new software giant <b>toggle</b> is using
a new type of checkbox, which shows good performance when number of boxes to be
checked is high. In normal check box, a box is checked or unchecked if and only
if it is clicked but in <b>toggle </b>checkbox when a box is clicked then all
the boxes below it is also gets its status. That is if a box is originally not
checked then if someone clicks this box then this box and all the boxes below
it will be checked. Similarly if a box is checked and someone clicks on it then
it will become unchecked and so will all the boxes below it. So the selection
made on the left can be made by only five clicks (The boxes that has to be
clicked are marked with red or dark square on the right figure) in <b>toggle </b>checkbox
(We are calling naming new type of checkbox as toggle checkbox).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

show better performance when at least 50% boxes are to be checked. For example
for the selection shown in the above picture we needed 12 clicks to check 12
boxes in normal checkbox but only five clicks were required for <b>toggle </b>checkboxes.
So in this situation <b>toggle boxes </b>show better performance. In many other
selection, <b>toggle </b>checkbox would also show strictly better performance.
Your job is to count in how many selection patterns (where at least m boxes out
of the n boxes in the checkbox are to be selected) toggle check box would show
better performance and in how many selection patterns ordinary checkbox would
show better performance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the monsters. After spotting the locations, Tanzibal has to drop the
superpowers one after another on the ground, at different locations, in order
to attack the monsters. A superpower, when dropped at certain point, creates a
magic ring of certain radius. Any monster that lies within the periphery of
this ring will be injured. The radii of the rings generated by the superpowers
are all same, but its value is in Tanzibals control. Tanzibal chooses a radius
that is as low as possible. All the rings will have this particular radius that

There are two kinds of peaks in a line chart, 1) <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Upper</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Peak</st1:PlaceType> and 2) <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Lower</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Peak</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Upper</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Peak</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> is that point in a line chart whose previous and next point has smaller y coordinates and lower peak is that points in a line chart whose previous and next point has greater y coordinates. For example total number of peak in figure 1 is 3. Two of them upper peak, which
are (3, 4) and (5, 5), and one of them is lower peak which is (4, 2).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ACRush observed that by ignoring SRT#380, his line chart will become like
figure 2, in which number of peak is only 1. By observing this he became more
curious. Now he wants to know, by ignoring 0 or more SRTs how many distinct
line charts having K peaks is possible. ACRush calls these line charts K-peak
Line charts, in a K-peak line chart he doesnt allow two consecutive points to
have same y coordinate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Well, maybe not that much easier.<p>Now that almost everyone can have access to GPS navigation devices able to calculate shortest paths, most routes that form the shortest path are getting slower because of heavy traffic. As most people try to follow the same path, it's not worth it anymore to follow these directions.<p>With this in his mind, your boss asks you to develop a new application that only he will have access to, thus saving him time whenever he has a meeting or any urgent event. He asks you that the program must answer not the shortest path, but the almost shortest path. He defines the almost shortest path as the shortest path that goes from a starting point to a destination point such that no route between two consecutive points belongs to any shortest path from the starting point to the destination.<p>For example, suppose the figure below represents the map given, with circles representing location points, and lines representing direct, one-way routes with lengths indicated. The starting point is marked as <tt>S</tt> and the destination point is marked as <tt>D</tt>. The bold lines belong to a shortest path (in this case there are two shortest paths, each with total length 4). Thus, the almost shortest path would be the one indicated by dashed lines (total length 5), as no route between two consecutive points belongs to any shortest path. Notice that there could exist more than one possible answer, for instance if the route with length 3 had length 1. There could exist no possible answer as well.<p><center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/p4210.gif/></center><p><h3>Input</h3>The input contains several test cases.

Each point is identified by an integer between 0 and <i>N</i> -1. The second line contains two integers <i>S</i> and <i>D</i>, separated by a single space, indicating respectively the starting and the destination points (<i>S</i> &ne; <i>D</i>; 0 &le; <i>S</i>, <i>D</i> &lt; <i>N</i>).

For example the word <tt>ove</tt> is a segment of the word <tt>lovely</tt>, whereas the word <tt>loly</tt> is a subsequence of <tt>lovely</tt>, but not a segment.<p>A word is a <em>common subsequence</em> of two words <i>w</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>w</i><sub>2</sub> if it is a subsequence of each of the two words. A <em>longest common subsequence</em> of <i>w</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>w</i><sub>2</sub> is a common subsequence of <i>w</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>w</i><sub>2</sub> having the largest possible length.

In general, the point (<i>r</i>, &theta;) can be represented as (<i>r</i>, &theta; ±<i>k</i> &times;360<sup><i>o</i></sup>) or ( -<i>r</i>, &theta; ±(2<i>k</i> + 1) &times;180<sup><i>o</i></sup>), where <i>k</i> is any integer. Besides, the origin (<i>r</i> = 0) can be represented as (0, &theta;) for any &theta;.  <p> Using these parameters informed by each particle accelerator, your granddaughter wants to determine whether the particles will eventually collide and, if they do, the time when they will collide. After the first collision it is impossible to predict the particle's trajectory, therefore, only the first possible collision should be considered.  <p> Although your granddaughter is really intelligent and has a deep knowledge of particle physics, she does not know how to program computers and is looking for some notes in her grandfather's (or grandmother's) ICPC notebook (don't forget, she is <em>your</em> granddaughter!). Fortunately for you, there is a note on your notebook which says that you wrote that code during the 2008 ICPC South America Regional Contest (or, to be more specific, <em>this</em> contest).  <p>  <h3>Input</h3>  <p> The input consists of several test cases, one per line. Each test case contains eight integer numbers separated by single spaces, <i>A</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>C</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>D</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>A</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>B</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>D</i><sub>2</sub> ( -10<sup>4</sup>   &le; <i>A</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>D</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>A</i><sub>2</sub>,<i>B</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>D</i><sub>2</sub>   &le; 10<sup>4</sup>).  The first four input values (<i>A</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>C</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>D</i><sub>1</sub>) correspond to the four parameters displayed by the first portable particle accelerator and the following input values (<i>A</i><sub>2</sub>,<i>B</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>D</i><sub>2</sub>) correspond to the four parameters displayed by the second portable particle accelerator when both particles are thrown. The end of the input is represented by <i>A</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>B</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>C</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>D</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>A</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>B</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>D</i><sub>2</sub> = 0, which should not be processed as a test case, since these are the values displayed by the particle accelerators when a big black hole would be created if the particles were trown. Although the end of input is represented by a line with eight zeroes, note that the number zero is a possible input value.  <p>  <h3>Output</h3>  <p> For each test case, your program must output a line containing two non-negative integers <i>t</i><sub><i>a</i></sub> and <i>t</i><sub><i>b</i></sub> separated by a single space. If there is no possibility of collision, <i>t</i><sub><i>a</i></sub> = <i>t</i><sub><i>b</i></sub> = 0, otherwise, <i>t</i><sub><i>a</i></sub>/<i>t</i><sub><i>b</i></sub> must be an irreducible fraction representing the earliest collision time. Even if the fraction results in an integer value, you still must output the number 1 as the denominator (see samples below).  <p> <table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="10"><tr><td width="50%" valign="top"><b>Sample input</b<br><pre>

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"><html><head><title>Traveling Shoemaker Problem</title></head><body> <!--h1 align="center">Traveling Shoemaker Problem</h1--><p>Once upon a time there was a very peaceful country named Nlogonia. Back then, Poly the Shoemaker could come to the country and travel freely from city to city doing his job without any harassment. This task was very easy, as every city in Nlogonia had a direct road to every other city in the country. He could then easily travel the whole country visiting each city exactly once and fixing everybody's shoes.<p>But not anymore. The times have changed and war has come to Nlogonia. The age when people could travel freely is over.<p>Confederations identified by colors were formed among the cities all over the country, and now each city belongs to at least one and at most two confederations. When trying to enter a city, you must give to the border officer a ticket from one of the confederations this city belongs to. When leaving the city, you receive a ticket from the other confederation the city belongs to (i.e. different from the one you gave when entering) or from the same confederation if the city only belongs to one.<p>As Poly the Shoemaker is a long time friend of Nlogonia, he is allowed to choose a ticket and a city he wants to enter as the first city in the country, but after that he must obey the confederations rules. He wants to do the same routine he did before, visiting each city exactly once in Nlogonia, but now it's not easy for him to do this, even though he can choose where to start his journey.<p>For example, suppose there are four cities, labeled from 0 to 3. City 0 belongs to confederations <i>red</i> and <i>green</i>; city 1 belongs only to <i>red</i>; city 2 belongs to <i>green</i> and <i>yellow</i>; and city 3 belongs to <i>blue</i> and <i>red</i>. If Poly the Shoemaker chooses to start at city 0, he can enter it carrying either the <i>red</i> or the <i>green</i> ticket and leave receiving the other. Should he choose the <i>red</i> ticket, he will leave with a <i>green</i> ticket, and then there is only city 2 he can travel to. When leaving city 2 he receives the <i>yellow</i> ticket and now can't go anywhere else. If he had chosen the <i>green</i> ticket as the first he would receive the <i>red</i> one when leaving, and then he could travel to cities 1 or 3. If he chooses city 3, when leaving he will receive the <i>blue</i> ticket and again can't go anywhere else. If he chooses city 1, he receives the <i>red</i> ticket again when leaving (city 1 belongs only to the <i>red</i> confederation) and can only travel to city 3 and will never get to city 2. Thus, it is not possible to visit each city exactly once starting at city 0. It is possible, however, starting at city 2 with the <i>yellow</i> ticket, leaving the city with the <i>green</i> ticket, then visiting city 0, leaving with <i>red</i> ticket, then visiting city 1, leaving with <i>red</i> ticket again and, at last, visiting city 3.<p>As you can see, it got really difficult for Poly the Shoemaker to accomplish the task, so he asks you to help him. He wants to know if it's possible to choose a city to start such that he can travel all cities from Nlogonia exactly once.<p>Can you help Poly the Shoemaker?<p><h3>Input</h3>The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains two integers <i>N</i> and <i>C</i>, separated by one space, indicating respectively the number of cities (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 500) and confederations (1 &le; <i>C</i> &le; 100) in the country. Each of the next <i>C</i> lines describes a confederation. It starts with one integer <i>K</i> (0 &le; <i>K</i> &le; <i>N</i>) and then <i>K</i> integers representing the cities which belong to this confederation. All integers are separated by single spaces and cities are numbered from 0 to <i>N</i> -1. Each city will appear at least once and at most twice and no city will be repeated on the same confederation.<p>The end of input is indicated by a line containing two zeroes separated by a single space.<p><h3>Output</h3><p>For each test case in the input, your program must print a single line, containing the integer <tt>-1</tt> if it's not possible to match the requirements or one integer representing the city where Poly the Shoemaker can start his journey. If there are multiple correct answers, print the smallest one.<p><table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="10"><tr><td width="50%" valign="top"><b>Sample input</b<br><pre>

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"><html><head><title>Bora Bora</title></head><body> <!--h1 align="center">Bora Bora</h1--><p>Bora Bora is a simple card game for children, invented in the South Pacific Island of the same name. Two or more players can play, using a deck of standard cards. Cards have the usual ranks: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and King. Each card has also one of four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades.<p>Players sit on a circle around the table and play by turns. The next player to play may be the one to the left (clockwise direction) or to the right (counter-clockwise direction) of the current player, depending on the cards played, as we will see. At the start, the direction of play is clockwise.<p>The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt a hand of cards. The remaining of the deck is placed, face down, on the table; this is called the <em>stock</em> pile. Then the first (topmost) card is removed from the stock and placed on the table, face up, starting another pile, called the <em>discard</em> pile.<p>The objective of the game is for a player to discard all his cards. At each turn, a player discards at most one card. A card can be discarded only if it has the same rank or the same suit as the topmost card on the discard pile. A player discards a card by placing it, face up, in the discard pile (this card becomes the topmost). If a player does not have a suitable card to discard on his turn, he must draw one card from the stock and add it to his hand; if he can discard that card, he does so, otherwise he does nothing else and his turn ends. A player always discards the highest valued card he possibly can. The <em>value</em> of a card is determined first by the card rank and then by the card suit. The rank order is the rank itself (Ace is the lowest, King is the highest), and the suit order is, from lowest to highest, Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades. Therefore, the highest valued card is the King of Spades and the lowest valued card is the Ace of Clubs. As an example, a Queen of Diamonds has a higher value than a Jack (any suit) but has a lower value than a Queen of Hearts.<p>Some of the discarded cards affect the play, as follows:<p><ul><li>when a Queen is discarded, the direction of play is reversed: if the direction is clockwise, it changes to counter-clockwise, and vice-versa;<br /><br /></li><li>when a Seven is discarded, the next player to play must draw two cards from the stock (the number of cards in his hand increases by two), and misses his turn (does not discard any card);<br /><br /></li><li>when an Ace is discarded, the next player to play must draw one card from the stock (the number of cards in his hand increases by one), and misses his turn (does not discard any card);<br /><br /></li><li>when a Jack is discarded, the next player to play misses his turn (does not discard any card).<br /><br /></li></ul><p>Notice that the penalty for the first card in the discard pile (the card draw from the stock at the beginning) is applied to the first player to play. For example, if the first player to play is <i>p</i> and the first card on the discard pile is an Ace, player <i>p</i> draws a card from the stock and does not discard any card on his first turn. Also notice that if the first card is a Queen, the direction of play is reversed to counter-clockwise, but the first player to play remains the same.<p>The winner is the player who first discards all his cards (the game ends after the winner discards his last card).<p>Given the description of the shuffled deck and the number of players, write a program to determine who will win the game.<p><h3>Input</h3>The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains three integers <i>P</i>, <i>M</i> and <i>N</i>, separated by single spaces, indicating respectively the number of players (2 &le; <i>P</i> &le; 10), the number of cards distributed to each of the players at the beginning of the game (1 &le; <i>M</i> &le; 11) and the total number of cards in the shuffled deck (3 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 300). Each of the next <i>N</i> lines contains the description of one card. A card is described by one integer <i>X</i> and one character <i>S</i>, separated by one space, representing respectively the card rank and the card suite. Card ranks are mapped to integers from 1 to 13 (Ace is 1, Jack is 11, Queen is 12 and King is 13). Card suits are designated by the suit's first letter: '<tt>C</tt>' (Clubs), '<tt>D</tt>' (Diamonds), '<tt>H</tt>' (Hearts) or '<tt>S</tt>' (Spades).<p>Players are identified by numbers from 1 to <i>P</i>, and sit on a circle, in clockwise direction, 1, 2 &hellip;<i>P</i>, 1. The first <i>P</i>&times;<i>M</i> cards of the deck are dealt to the players: the first <i>M</i> cards to the first player (player 1), the next <i>M</i> to the second player (player 2), and so on. After dealing the cards to the players, the next card on the deck - the (<i>P</i> &times;<i>M</i> + 1)-th card - is used to start the discard pile, and the remaining cards form the stock. The (<i>P</i> &times;<i>M</i> + 2)-th card to appear on the input is the topmost card on the stock, and the last card to appear on the input (the <i>N</i>-th card) is the bottommost card of the stock (the last card that can be drawn). Player 1 is always the first to play (even when the card used to start the discard pile is a Queen). All test cases have one winner, and in all test cases the number of cards in the deck is sufficient for playing to the end of the game.<p>The end of input is indicated by a line containing only three zeros, separated by single spaces.<p><h3>Output</h3><p>For each test case in the input, your program must print a single line, containing the number of the player who wins the game.<p><table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="10"><tr><td width="50%" valign="top"><b>Sample input</b<br><pre>

It is desirable to transport as much goods as possible each trip. Unfortunately, one cannot always use the roads in the shortest route: some roads may have obstacles (e.g. bridge overpass, tunnels) which limit heights of the goods transported. Therefore, the company would like to transport as much as possible each trip, and then choose the shortest route that can be used to transport that amount.</p><p>For the given cargo truck, maximizing the height of the goods transported is equivalent to maximizing the amount of goods transported.

This is followed by <var>R</var> lines each containing the city numbers of the cities connected by that road, the maximum height allowed on that road, and the length of that road. The maximum height for each road is a positive integer, except that a height of -1 indicates that there is no height limit on that road. The length of each road is a positive integer at most 1000. Every road can be travelled in both directions, and there is at most one road connecting each distinct pair of cities. Finally, the last line of each case consists of the start and end city numbers, as well as the height limit (a positive integer) of the cargo truck.

It only has three statements: Set, Print, and the compound When clause. The (case insensitive) grammar is as follows<blockquote><pre>
PROGRAM := WHEN | PROGRAM WHEN
WHEN := 'when ' EXPRESSION EOL STATEMENTS 'end when' EOL
STATEMENTS := STATEMENT | STATEMENTS STATEMENT
STATEMENT := PRINT | SET
PRINT := 'print '  EXPRESSION_LIST EOL
SET := 'set ' ASSIGNMENT_LIST EOL
EXPRESSION_LIST := EXPRESSION | EXPRESSION_LIST ',' EXPRESSION
ASSIGNMENT_LIST := ASSIGNMENT | ASSIGNMENT_LIST ',' ASSIGNMENT
ASSIGNMENT := VARIABLE '=' EXPRESSION
EXPRESSION := '(' EXPRESSION OP EXPRESSION ')' | VARIABLE | NUMBER 
OP :=  '&lt;' | '+' | '-' | 'and' | 'or' | 'xor'
VARIABLE := '$' NOT_DOLLAR_STRING '$'
NUMBER := DIGIT | NUMBER DIGIT
DIGIT := '0' | .. | '9'
NOT_DOLLAR_STRING := any sequence of printing characters (including blanks)
                     that does not contain a $ symbol.
</pre></blockquote></p><p>In the above, any string enclosed in single quotes are to be treated literally. EOL is the end of line.</p><p>In words, a program consists of a list of when blocks, which themselves contain set and print statements. Case is ignored for key words and variable names. Spaces are allowed before or after any literal except inside a number. Spaces are allowed in variable names, and each non-empty sequence of spaces is treated as a single underscore, so the following refer to the same variable<blockquote><pre> 
$Remote Switch#1$ 
$Remote_Switch#1$ 
$Remote   switch#1$ 
</pre></blockquote><p>All variable and literal values are integers between -1000000000 and 1000000000, inclusively. All variables are global and initially zero. The when programs you will be tested on will never have an <tt>EXPRESSION</tt> that evaluates to a value outside of this range. The logical operators evaluate to 0 for false and 1 for true, and treat any nonzero value as true.</p><p>Running the When program amounts to executing all the active when clauses until none are active. More specifically, the active list of when clauses is initially empty, then the following steps are repeated:<ul><li>In the order they appear in the program, the conditions of all when clauses that are not currently active are evaluated. If true, the clause is added to the end of the active list, with its first statement marked as "ready". Each active when clause has one "ready" statement.</li> <li>If the active list is empty after this step, the program terminates.</li> <li>The "ready" statement from the "current" when clause (initially the first clause in the active list) is executed.</li> <li>The statement marked as "ready" is advanced, removing the when clause from the active list if this is the last statement in the "current" when clause.</li> <li>The when clause marked as "current" is advanced, cycling to the beginning of the active list if the end is reached.</li></ul></p><p>In other words, inactive when conditions are evaluated to determine if these clauses are added to the active list. Then one statement (set or print) is executed from the current active when clause. If this is the last statement in that clause, it is removed from the active list. One the next iteration, one statement is executed from the next active when clause, etc.</p><p>A set statement executes all the assignments concurrently, so that<blockquote><pre>
set $x$=$y$,$y$=$x$
</pre></blockquote>swaps the values of $x$ and $y$. The same variable cannot appear twice on the left hand part of the same set statement (so set $x$=1,$x$=2 is illegal).</p><p>A print statement evaluates and prints the given expressions in the output, separated by commas and followed by a new line. So<blockquote><pre>
	print 1,(2+3)
</pre></blockquote>results in the line<blockquote><pre>
	1,5
</pre></blockquote>in the output.</p><h1>Input</h1><p>The input consists of several test cases separated by a blank line. Each of them is a single syntactically correct program. You may assume that the program will not execute more than 100000 set statements and 100000 print statements.</p><h1>Output</h1><p>For each case, print the output produced by executing the given program.

The tiny country of Waterlogged is protected by a series of levees that form a quadrilateral as shown below:

The quadrilateral is defined by four vertices. The levees partition the country into four quadrants. Each quadrant is identified by a pair of vertices representing the outside edge of that quadrant. For example, Quadrant 1 shown below is defined by the points <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I>1, <I>y</I>1)</SPAN>

It happens very often that the country of Waterlogged becomes flooded, and the levees need to be reinforced, but their country is poor and they have limited resources.

Consider a simple variation of the card game Blackjack. In this game, a single player plays against the dealer. The game uses a standard deck of cards, where numbered cards are worth the number of points on the card for the cards numbered 2 to 10, 10 points for the face cards (King, Queen, and Jack) and either 1 or 11 points for the Aces. 

<P>
The dealer deals the first card in the deck to the player, the second to the dealer, the third to the player, and the fourth to the dealer. The player then may continue to draw cards until s/he decides that the total is as close as possible to 21 and stops voluntarily or until s/he goes over 21. If the player goes over 21, the player loses. Then the dealer must draw cards until s/he reaches 17 or more points (with aces counting as 11 when possible). If the dealer goes over 21, the dealer loses. If neither of them goes over 21, the winner is the one who comes as close as possible to 21. If the player and the dealer have the same total, the player wins. 

<P>
For example, suppose the first cards in the deck are Queen, 6, 4, 9, and 10. On the initial deal, the player will receive Queen and 4 (for a total of 14) and the dealer will receive 6 and 9 (for a total of 15). If the player does not select a card, the dealer will have to draw (because the dealer's total is less than 17) and will draw the 10, going over, so the player will win. But if the player draws a card (the 10), the player's total will be 24, so the player will lose. 

<P>
In some situations, it is impossible for the player to win. Consider the case when the cards in the deck are: 10, 3, 4, King, 3, 5. The player will be dealt the cards 10 and 4. The dealer will have 3 and King. The table below illustrates what happens for each number of cards the player might draw:

You are in a rectangular maze and you would like to leave the maze as quickly as possible. The maze is a rectangular grid of square locations. Some locations are blocked. Some other locations are exits. If you arrive at an exit location, you can immediately leave the maze. 

<P>
You may walk one step at a time, onto one of the locations adjacent to your current location. Two locations are adjacent if they share a side. That is, you can only move one step North, South, East or West. Of course, you cannot step off the maze, and you cannot step onto a blocked location. 

<P>
In addition, at any step, you may choose to use your teleport device. This device will send you to a random non-blocked location inside the maze with uniform probability (including, possibly, the one where you currently are standing!). If the device happens to send you onto a spot that is also an exit, then you leave the maze immediately. Hooray! 

<P>
The only way to leave the maze is by moving onto an exit (either by teleport or walking), you may not walk off the boundary of the maze. Write a program to calculate the expected number of steps you need in order to leave the maze. Assume that you would choose your actions (movements and using teleport device) optimally in order to minimize the expected number of steps to leave the maze. Using the teleport device is considered one step.

Biologists are studying a certain, interesting kind of worm. Each worm can be seen as a line of cells of different types. When a worm is born, it only consists of a single cell. Every day, exactly 1 cell of the entire worm will grow and change into 2 cells. It is rather easy to determine the age of any such worm, since it's simply one less than the number of cells the worm has.

<P>
During a worm's growth, a cell does not change into any 2 arbitrary cells; each worm has a set of ``growth rules" (encoded in its DNA) that it obeys. A growth rule can be expressed as <!-- MATH
 $A \rightarrow BC$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I> <IMG

 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/4231img1.png

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> are uppercase letters (with letters A-T), representing different types of the worm's cells. The rule <!-- MATH
 $A \rightarrow BC$
 -->

 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/4231img1.png

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> means that in one day, any single cell <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> can be grown into the 2 adjacent cells <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>BC</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, in that order. Note that the rule <!-- MATH
 $I \rightarrow JK$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>I</I> <IMG

 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/4231img1.png

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is different from the rule <!-- MATH

 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>I</I> <IMG
 WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/4231img1.png
 ALT="$ \rightarrow$"> <I>KJ</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Different worms may have a different set of growth rules. 

<P>
The worms have now thrown the scientists for a loop. Due to some unknown reason, some worms have mutated into a new kind of specimen. This new kind of worm has the exact same properties, except that during its growth, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">multiple</SPAN> parts of its body can grow at the same time. That is, every day any (at least one, at most all) of its cells can grow; each cell that grows will grow into exactly 2 cells (obeying growth rules similar to their older cousins). 

<P>
As a result of the mutation, it is no longer trivial to determine the age of a worm. In fact, the exact age of some worms cannot be determined. As a simple example, if a worm has growth rules: <!-- MATH
 $A \rightarrow BC$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I> <IMG

<P>Joe's landscaping company specializes in gardens for computer geeks who have just had their company go public.

<P>Bob Roberts owns a design business which creates custom artwork for various corporations. One technique that his company likes to use is to take a simple rectilinear figure (a figure where all sides meet at 90 or 270 degrees and which contains no holes) and draw one or more rectilinear borders around them. Each of these borders is drawn so that it is a set distance <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> away from the previously drawn border (or the original figure if it is the first border) and then the new area outlined by each border is painted a unique color. Some examples are shown below (without the coloring of the borders).<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="126" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/p4241a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4241a.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>The example on the left shows a simple rectilinear figure (grey) with two borders drawn around it.

<P>Jack Barter is a wheeler-dealer of the highest sort. He'll trade anything for anything, as long as he gets a good deal. Recently, he wanted to trade some red agate marbles for some goldfish. Jack's friend Amanda was willing to trade him 1 goldfish for 2 red agate marbles. But Jack did some more digging and found another friend Chuck who was willing to trade him 5 plastic shovels for 3 marbles while Amanda was willing to trade 1 goldfish for 3 plastic shovels. Jack realized that he could get a better deal going through Chuck (1.8 marbles per goldfish) than by trading his marbles directly to Amanda (2 marbles per goldfish).<P>Jack revels in transactions like these, but he limits the number of other people involved in a chain of transactions to 9 (otherwise things can get a bit out of hand). Normally Jack would use a little program he wrote to do all the necessary calculations to find the optimal deal, but he recently traded away his computer for a fine set of ivory-handled toothpicks.

<P>LCR is a simple game for three or more players. Each player starts with three chips and the object is to be the last person to have any chips. Starting with Player 1, each person rolls a set of three dice. Each die has six faces, one face with an <TT>L</TT>, one with a <TT>C</TT>, one with an <TT>R</TT> and three with a dot. For each <TT>L</TT> rolled, the player must pass a chip to the player on their left (Player 2 is considered to be to the left of Player 1); for each <TT>R</TT> rolled, the player passes a chip to the player on their right; and for each <TT>C</TT> rolled, the player puts a chip in a central pile which belongs to no player. No action is taken for any dot that is rolled. Play continues until only one player has any chips left. In addition, the following rules apply:<P><P><BR><OL><LI>A player with no chips is not out of the game, since they may later gain chips based on other players' rolls. </LI><LI>A player with only 1 or 2 chips left only rolls 1 or 2 dice, respectively. A player with no chips left does not roll but just passes the dice to the next player. </LI></OL><P>Your job is to simulate this game given a sequence of dice rolls.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Input will consist of multiple test cases.

Emma has just graduated high school and it is the custom for the new graduates to throw parties for themselves and invite everyone in school to attend. Naturally, Emma wishes to attend as many parties as possible. This is not such a problem on a weekday since usually there are only two or three parties in the evening. But, Saturdays are packed! Typically some parties start at 8 AM (breakfast is served) while others might end at midnight (much to the annoyance of the neighbors). Emma naturally wants to know how many parties she can attend. 

<P>
Each party has a starting and stopping time, which are on the hour. These are listed via a 24-hour clock. For example, a party might start at 10 AM (10) and end at 2 PM (14). The earliest a party can start is 8 AM (8) and the latest it can end is midnight (24). In order not to be rude, Emma stays at each party at least one half hour and will consider traveling time between parties to be instantaneous. If there are times during the day when there are no parties to attend, she'll simply go home and rest.

By now, everyone has played Sudoku: you're given a 9-by-9 grid of boxes which you are to fill in with the digits 1 through 9 so that 1) every row has all nine digits, 2) every column has all nine digits, and 3) all nine 3-by-3 subgrids have all nine digits. To start the game you are given a partially completed grid and are asked to fill in the remainder of the boxes. One such puzzle is shown below.

Imagine you have a car with a very large gas tank - large enough to hold whatever amount you need. You are traveling on a circular route on which there are a number of gas stations. The total gas in all the stations is exactly the amount it takes to travel around the circuit once. When you arrive at a gas station, you add all of that station's gas to your tank. Starting with an empty tank, it turns out there is at least one station to start, and a direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) where you can make it around the circuit. (On the way home, you might ponder why this is the case - but trust us, it is.) 

<P>
Given the distance around the circuit, the locations of the gas stations, and the number of miles your car could go using just the gas at each station, find all the stations and directions you can start at and make it around the circuit.

Winston the Worm just woke up in a fresh rectangular patch of earth. The rectangular patch is divided into cells, and each cell contains either food or a rock. Winston wanders aimlessly for a while until he gets hungry; then he immediately eats the food in his cell, chooses one of the four directions (north, south, east, or west) and crawls in a straight line for as long as he can see food in the cell in front of him. If he sees a rock directly ahead of him, or sees a cell where he has already eaten the food, or sees an edge of the rectangular patch, he turns left or right and once again travels as far as he can in a straight line, eating food. He never revisits a cell. After some time he reaches a point where he can go no further so Winston stops, burps and takes a nap. 

<P>
For instance, suppose Winston wakes up in the following patch of earth (X's represent stones, all other cells contain food):

Congratulations! Your county has just won a state grant to install a rail system between the two largest towns in the county  -- Acmar and Ibmar. This rail system will be installed in sections, each section connecting two different towns in the county, with the first section starting at Acmar and the last ending at Ibmar. The provisions of the grant specify that the state will pay for the two largest sections of the rail system, and the county will pay for the rest (if the rail system consists of only two sections, the state will pay for just the larger section; if the rail system consists of only one section, the state will pay nothing). The state is no fool and will only consider simple paths; that is, paths where you visit a town no more than once. It is your job, as a recently elected county manager, to determine how to build the rail system so that the county pays as little as possible. You have at your disposal estimates for the cost of connecting various pairs of cities in the county, but you're short one very important requirement  -- the brains to solve this problem. Fortunately, the lackeys in the computing services division will come up with something.

<P>In modern molecular biology the genome of an organism is its hereditary information encoded in DNA. The genome includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA. In the view of computer science, the genome can be regarded as a very long string consisting of only four letters {<TT>A</TT>,<TT>G</TT>,<TT>T</TT>,<TT>C</TT>}.<P>In order to study specific genetic diseases, it is very important to examine if there are DNA (substring) patterns which appear more frequently than others in a whole genome. Especially we are intended in finding ``<SPAN CLASS="textit">compositionally equivalent</SPAN>" substrings. A string P is said to be compositionally equivalent to a string Q if the number of 4 letters {<TT>A</TT>,<TT>G</TT>,<TT>T</TT>,<TT>C</TT>} appearing in P and Q is exactly the same. For example, P=``<TT>ATTATGC</TT>" is compositionally equivalent to Q=``<TT>GTATCTA</TT>" since the number of `<TT>A</TT>' , `<TT>G</TT>' , `<TT>C</TT>' and `<TT>T</TT>' in P is exactly same to that in Q, respectively. In the other hand, ``<TT>TTGCA</TT>" is not compositionally equivalent to ``<TT>TGCCA</TT>".<P>In this problem we want to find the <SPAN ID="txt65"><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-Major Composition Substring</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-MCS for short). For a genome string given, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-MCS is defined as the most frequently appearing substring of length <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> up to compositionally equivalence. Since the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-MCS for a given input genome is not necessarily unique, two or more different <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-MCS could be possible. In the following, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-substring means a substring of length <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.<P>Let us show one example. We have a genome string W=``<TT>GCAGGAGCGCCAGG</TT>" with length 14. There are many different compositionally equivalent 3-substrings such as <TT>GCA</TT>, <TT>CAG</TT>, <TT>GGA</TT>, <TT>GAG</TT>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> <TT>CAG</TT> and <TT>AGG</TT>. In W it is easy to find that ``<TT>AGG</TT>" is a 3-MCS which appears four times as <TT>AGG</TT>, <TT>GGA</TT>, <TT>GAG</TT> and <TT>AGG</TT>, since there is no other 3-substring (up to compositionally equivalence) which appears more than 4 times in W.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your program is to read the input from standard input.

<P>Mr. Kim visits his hometown annually. He always drives his car following the shortest path to his hometown. Since he is a very economical person, he only fills his fuel tank with the amount of gasoline needed to follow the shortest path for fuel efficiency. Last year, he fueled the exact amount to travel the shortest path, but he was in big trouble because an unexpected accident occurred on the shortest path. That is, he was short of gasoline because he had to find a detour to get to his hometown.<P>This year, he wants to fuel enough gasoline considering unexpected detours caused by an accident. According to statistical reports, at most one accident occurs in a day. (His hometown can be reached if he drives all day long.) Thus he wants to fill his fuel tank with the smallest amount of gasoline supposing that there will be only one accident. For this, he will find the shortest path to get to his hometown wherever the accident occurs.<P>The road system can be represented as a weighted graph <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I> = (<I>V</I>, <I>E</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the set of vertices that represent cities, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the set of edges that represent roads connecting two cities, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I>(<I>e</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the weight of each edge <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>e</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> that represents the amount of gasoline needed to drive the corresponding road. An accident always occurs in the middle of a road and the occurrence of the accident can be found when he reaches the cities which are incident with the road. This means that no accident can be reported in advance.<P>For example, consider the case when the city of departure is node 0 and the city of arrival is node 5 in the given graph below. Then the shortest path is <!-- MATH
 $P = <0,1,4,5>$
 --><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I> = &lt; 0, 1, 4, 5 &gt;</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and the units of gasoline, i.e., the sum of weights on the shortest path, is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I>(<I>P</I>) = 6</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Suppose that an accident occurs in the edge (0, 1) between the two cities 0 and 1. Then, the shortest detour at node 0 which does not make use of edge (0, 1) becomes <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt; 0, 2, 4, 5 &gt;</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and it requires 2 more units of gasoline than path P.

So, Mr. Kim should fill his fuel tank with at least 10 units of gasoline since he needs 4 more units of gasoline than that of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I>(<I>P</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, i.e., 4 more units of gasoline is the largest amount considering the detour by an unexpected accident for every node on the shortest path <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="486" HEIGHT="321" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/p4251.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4251.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>When we are given the road system represented as a weighted graph and the shortest path from the city of departure to the city of arrival followed by Mr. Kim, find the smallest amount of gasoline that Mr. Kim has to fuel considering a detour by an accident.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your program is to read from standard input.

<P>A small computer of Von Neumann architecture named ICPC is used for the BDN Programming Contest. ICPC is a 16-bit integer machine. There is a sufficient number of instruction memory cells in ICPC but it has only one data memory cell. ICPC has 6 registers: R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, and PC. The R<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> registers are general purpose but PC is the program counter storing the address of the next instruction to be executed. The PC value can be changed only by a group of control-flow instructions. This machine follows the usual fetch-decodeexecute cycles. The PC value is normally increased automatically except for the cases of the control flow instructions. ICPC has only two addressing modes, immediate value and register, but PC cannot be used as an operand. The whole set of instructions of ICPC is shown in Table 1. In Table 1, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> denotes a register, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> denotes a register or an integer value, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> denotes the data memory cell.<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Table 1: The instruction set of ICPC</DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=2 BORDER FRAME=BOX RULES=GROUPS><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=LEFT><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>ICPC Instruction</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>The meaning of the instruction in C</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>load</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I> = <I>M</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>;</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>store</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I> = <I>v</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>;</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>move</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I>&nbsp;<I>v</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I> = <I>v</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>;</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>add</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I>&nbsp;<I>v</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I> + = <I>v</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>;</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>sub</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I>&nbsp;<I>v</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I> - = <I>v</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>;</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>loop</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>while</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I> &gt; 0)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> {</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&nbsp;/SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> <SPAN CLASS="textit">instructions</SPAN></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&nbsp;/SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> execute the <SPAN CLASS="textit">instructions</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>pool</TT></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>}</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>cond</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>if</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I> &gt; 0)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> {</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&nbsp;/SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> <SPAN CLASS="textit">instructions</SPAN></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&nbsp;/SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> execute the <SPAN CLASS="textit">instructions</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>dnoc</TT></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>}</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P><P><BR>Every step of the fetch-decode-execute cycle is called ``cycle." Therefore every instruction consumes three cycles at least and every ICPC instruction, except for <TT>dnoc</TT>, consumes exactly three cycles. The instruction <TT>dnoc</TT> is just used for denoting the end of <TT>cond</TT> and not executed at all. This kind of instruction is called a pseudo instruction; <TT>dnoc</TT> is the only pseudo instruction in ICPC. The instruction <TT>pool</TT> denotes the end of <TT>loop</TT>, just like <TT>dnoc</TT>, but it is executed indeed for the control flow should return the beginning of the <TT>loop</TT> at the end of a <TT>loop</TT>.<P>To minimize the execution time of programs, pipelining is usually adopted in modern computer architectures and ICPC also adopts it. Assuming that three instructions, namely A, B, and C, are to be executed in sequence, the decode cycle of A can overlap the fetch cycle of B and the execute cycle of A can overlap the decode cycle of B and also can overlap the fetch cycle of C. Therefore, it takes only 4 cycles for one <TT>move</TT> and one <TT>add</TT> instruction in sequence rather than 6 cycles, as shown in the first two instructions of Fig. 1(a). In Fig. 1, we used F for fetch, D for decode, and E for execute cycle.<P>Pipelining is stalled if the PC encounters a control flow instruction because we do not know the next instruction to be executed. The next instruction can be determined only after the control flow instruction is executed. The <TT>cond</TT> instruction in Fig. 1(a) shows this fact. Note that <TT>dnoc</TT> is not executed at all since it is a pseudo instruction and it takes 9 cycles to execute all the instructions in Fig. 1(a).<P>However the instruction <TT>loop</TT>, similar to <TT>dnoc</TT>, is really a control flow instruction. For example, in Figure 1(b), not only the instruction <TT>loop</TT> but also the instruction <TT>pool</TT> stalls the pipelining.<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=13 BORDER FRAME=BOX RULES=GROUPS><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP COLSPAN=2>Programs</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP COLSPAN=11>Cycles</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>1</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>2</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>3</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>4</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>5</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>6</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>7</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>8</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>9</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>10</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>11</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>move R1 0</TT></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>F</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>D</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>E</TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>add R1 1</TT></TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>F</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>D</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>E</TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>(a)</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>cond R1</TT></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>F</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>D</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>E</TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>add R1 2</TT></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>F</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>D</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>E</TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>dnoc</TT></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>add R1 5</TT></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>F</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>D </TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>E</TD><TD></TD><TD></TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>move R1 1</TT></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>F</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>D</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>E</TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>(b)</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>loop R1</TT></TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>F</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>D</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>E</TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>F</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>D</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>E</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>sub R1 1</TT></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>F</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>D</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>E</TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>pool</TT></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>F</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>D</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>E</TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1: Example programs and the corresponding cycle counts</DIV><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your program is to read the input from standard input.

An ``early adopter" Mr. Kim bought one of the latest notebooks which has a speed-controlled processor. The processor is able to operate at variable speed. But the higher the speed, the higher the power consumption is. So, to execute a set of programs, adjusting the speed of the processor dynamically results in energy-efficient schedules. We are concerned in a schedule to minimize the maximum speed of the processor.

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. We also assume that the available speeds are positive integers, that is, the processor operates only at integer points of speed. The speed is unbounded and the processor may operate at sufficiently large speeds to complete all the programs. The processor should complete all the given programs and the goal is to find a schedule minimizing the maximum of the speeds at which the processor operates. 

<P>
For example, there are five programs <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>

<SPAN CLASS="MATH">[<I>r</I><SUB>i</SUB>, <I>d</I><SUB>i</SUB>]</SPAN>

<P>Traveling salesmen of <SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="textbf">nhn</SPAN></SPAN>. (the prestigious Korean internet company) report their current location to the company on a regular basis. They also have to report their new location to the company if they are moving to another location. The company keep each salesman's working path on a map of his working area and uses this path information for the planning of the next work of the salesman. The map of a salesman's working area is represented as a connected and undirected graph, where vertices represent the possible locations of the salesman an edges correspond to the possible movements between locations. Therefore the salesman's working path can be denoted by a sequence of vertices in the graph. Since each salesman reports his position regularly an he can stay at some place for a very long time, the same vertices of the graph can appear consecutively in his working path.

<P>You, a promising metal-artist, try to make a metalwork, a piece of steel. You first mark <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> points on a big steel board, and cut a polygon connecting those <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> points from the board. For this cutting, you melt the board along the boundary of the polygon with two lasers hanging down from a long bar over the board as shown in Figure 1. The bar is vertical, i.e., parallel to the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-axis, and moves continuously (without stopping) only in the positive <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-direction, i.e., from the left side to the right side of the board. The lasers can move only along the bar and can never meet on the bar. Furthermore, the bar moves monotonously from left to right, it can never move to a position left of its current position. These conditions imply that the polygons you can obtain must be <SPAN CLASS="textit">simple</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="textit">monotone</SPAN>. A polygon <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is <SPAN CLASS="textit">simple</SPAN> if any two edges of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> do not intersect except for the endpoints of adjacent edges, and there are no holes inside <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

<P><P><BR>Somewhere in the world, there are two tribes separated by mountains. The two tribes are named Kulolo and Gulolo, respectively, where Kulolo is at a higher altitude and Gulolo is at a lower altitude. Due to the limitation of geography, Gulolo has fewer resources than Kulolo. In order to transport resources from Kulolo to Gulolo efficiently, several tunnels were built inside the mountains between these two tribes. There are also some rest stations built for people to take a break during the transportation in the tunnels. More specifically, each terminal of a tunnel is either Kulolo, Gulolo, or a rest station.<P>The structure of those tunnels is not stable. A <SPAN CLASS="textit">dangerous degree</SPAN> has been estimated for each tunnel, due to its stability, in advance. A tunnel with a higher dangerous degree is considered to be more dangerous; that is, it is more probably to collapse. Kinglolo, the chief of Kulolo, would like to select some paths through the tunnels to Gulolo with little risk. In Kinglolo's opinion, the dangerous degree of a path is equal to the maximum dangerous degree of the tunnels in the path; and the dangerous degree of a set of paths is equal to the maximum dangerous degree of the paths in it. For example, consider Figure 1. The dangerous degrees of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>P</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> are, respectively, 3, 5, and 6. And, the dangerous degree of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">{<I>P</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>P</I><SUB>3</SUB>}</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is 6.<P>Since all tunnels are narrow, a limited quantity of resources can be transported along a path in one day. Therefore, every day, depending on the amount of resources needed to be transported, a different number, say <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, of paths is required. Moreover, to avoid congestion, these <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> selected paths cannot pass any rest station in common. For example, in Figure 1, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="690" HEIGHT="401" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/p4259.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4259.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1: An example.</DIV>can be selected at the same time; however, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> cannot be selected at the same time, since they both pass <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Kulolo has a higher altitude than all rest stations while Gulolo has a lower altitude than all rest stations. Kinglolo is a thoughtful chief. It is ensured that the altitudes of the rest stations on each selected path are non-increasing, so that the path is more suitable for transportation. For example, in Figure 1, the path (Kulolo, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, Gulolo) will never be selected, since <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is higher than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> .<P>People in Kulolo believe that Kinglolo is the most brilliant man in the world, since he always selects a set of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> paths that is as little dangerous as possible (i.e., the maximum dangerous degree of the selected paths is minimized). Now, given the data of the constructed tunnels, you are asked to find <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> paths that Kinglolo may select. In summary, the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> selected paths, if exist, should satisfy the following:<P><OL><LI>all paths are from Kulolo to Gulolo, </LI><LI>no two paths pass the same rest station, </LI><LI>the altitudes of the rest stations on each path are non-increasing, and </LI><LI>the maximum dangerous degree of the paths is minimized. </LI></OL><P><P><BR>For simplicity, only the maximum dangerous degree of the selected paths should be reported.<P><P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Technical Specification</SPAN><OL><LI>The number of rest stations, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>: <!-- MATH

<P><P><BR>A popular card game called ``fortune" is getting popular in country X. Fig. 1 shows one of the cards. In each card, a positive integer number (20 in the figure) is listed as the address of the card. A symbol is drawn beside the address. There are five kinds of symbols, which are listed below the card. For convenience, let each symbol be represented by an English letter from `<TT>A</TT>'-`<TT>E</TT>'. The bottom of a card contains another number called ``next fortune number."<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="321" HEIGHT="410" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/p4260.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4260.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1: A sample fortune card and symbols.</DIV><P>In a set of fortune cards, many cards can have same address; that is, address 20 is not limited to appear only in one card. However, there will be no cards that are identical, i.e., no two cards with same address, symbol, and next fortune number.<P>The fortune card game is played as follows. A player starts with cards that have address 1. The goal of the game is trying to complete a ``spell" that is composed by the symbols. For example, let a spell be ``<TT>BADDAD</TT>". In the first move, the player will look for cards that have address 1 with a star symbol (which matches `<TT>B</TT>' in the spell). The next fortune numbers of these cards are the new addresses for the next move. The player can select one card to advance to a new address x. The selected card is then put back to the cards for next move but the fortune number is written down.<P>Let the example be continued. In the next move, the player needs to look for the cards that have new address x with the cross symbol (which matches the second `<TT>A</TT>' in the spell). Again, the player selects one card to advance to another new address. This procedure continues until the spell ``BADDAD" is completed. Once the player completes a spell, he wins a score by adding all the next fortune numbers of the selected card, which have been written down.<P>Given a spell and a set of fortune cards, please output the maximum score that can be played in this card game.<P><P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Technical Specification</SPAN><P><P><BR><OL><LI><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> - the number of test cases, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/p4260.png ALT="$ \le$">10</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. </LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> - the number of cards, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/p4260.png ALT="$ \le$">800</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. </LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> - the length of a spell, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/p4260.png ALT="$ \le$">150</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. </LI></OL><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Test data begins with an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> which is the number of test cases.

<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit">Accelerated Computer Maintenance</SPAN> (ACM) is a company that aims at fixing customers' home computers as soon as possible. While other companies ask the customer to bring her/his computer to the maintenance station by herself/himself, ACM implements a rapid pickup system. After receiving the service request from the customer during work hours, ACM immediately sends out a service representative from a branch office. The representative would then go to the customer's house, pick up the computer, and drop the computer at one of the maintenance stations. ACM's customers are very satisfied with such a rapid service, and thus ACM's revenue keeps increasing.<P>Seeing the success story of ACM, many other companies are starting to implement their own rapid pickup systems as well, and ACM faces a strong competition from those companies. Thus, ACM decides to improve its rapid pickup system by including early-morning pickup routes. That is, after gathering the service requests from customers during the night, ACM asks some of its service representatives to complete the pickup tasks on their ways to work. To share the loads, each representative only needs to pick up at most one computer. If a representative is selected to stop by a customer's house for the morning pickup task, she/he would start from her/his own house, and orderly go to the customer's house, one of the maintenance stations, and her/his office. Otherwise, she/he directly goes to the office.<P>To implement such a system, ACM models the city as a network. The representatives' houses, the customers' houses, the maintenance stations, and the branch offices are all parts of the nodes of the network. When two nodes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> are connected by a road, ACM computes the time needed to travel from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> in minutes. ACM, as its name suggests, is a company that highly values efficiency. Thus, it would like to implement a system that directs its representatives to arrive at the office as early as possible.

<P><P><BR>Astronomers have been looking for living beings in the outer planets. Recently the Hobble telescope has picked up binary (black and white) images from the Zkrets planet (1 light-years away). Each image contains exactly one symbol. Together the sequence of symbols (images) represents a message for aliens from other planets. A team of deciphering experts has found some decoding scheme that assigns an English alphabet to each symbol. The decoding process would be easy if each received image were in perfect condition. Unfortunately, due to long distance transmission, the images received usually contain some noise, meaning that some white pixels are turned into black pixels and vise versa. Furthermore, due to self-rotation of the Hobble telescope, the images, when captured, might be rotated 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees. To expedite the message decoding process, please write a program to decode the received sequence of images automatically.<P><P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Technical Specification</SPAN><OL><LI>The number of images received is n, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/4264img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>n</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/4264img1.png ALT="$ \le$">100</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

<P><P><BR>There is an old legend that there is a number of lost ships lay on the seafloor of the Taiwan Straight. Among them, the ship <SPAN CLASS="textit">General II</SPAN> is one of the most famous ships, and people believe that <SPAN CLASS="textit">General II</SPAN> was sunk with a tremendous amount of treasures. In the past few decades, tens of groups have tried to raise the treasures from <SPAN CLASS="textit">General II</SPAN>, but all of the attempts are failed. The reason is simply because those treasures are too fragile to tolerate any impacts in the raising, and unfortunately there are many obstacles scattered inside the ship such that raising a treasure from <SPAN CLASS="textit">General II</SPAN> becomes an extremely challenging task.<P>Being a senior underwater-raising analyst of the International Organization of Underwater Archaeology (IOUA), you are now assigned to raise an important treasure from <SPAN CLASS="textit">General II</SPAN>. Before that, the Underwater Scene Investigation Department (USID) of IOUA will investigate the detail information (e.g., the locations, sizes, and shapes of the obstacles) of <SPAN CLASS="textit">General II</SPAN>, as well as the information (e.g., location, size, and shape) of the treasure. Then, they will give you a ship map of <SPAN CLASS="textit">General II</SPAN> that can help you raise the treasure. Figure 1 shows an example of the ship map.<P>In the ship map, the obstacles are represented by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> non-overlapping rectangles that are filled with the grid pattern, and the treasure is composed of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> connected rectangles that are colored in black. A destination location for the treasure is also given on the map (filled with the white color). The destination location is an exit of <SPAN CLASS="textit">General II</SPAN>, and it is very important to move the treasure from its initial location to the destination location without conflicting with any obstacles. Once a treasure is moved to the destination location, it can be raised easily to the sea level through the exit then.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="845" HEIGHT="265" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/p4265.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4265.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1: The sample ship map. Figure 2: The sample solution.</DIV><P>Note that, the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> treasure rectangles must be moved altogether without rotation and/or flipping; moreover, the treasure must be moved only in one of the four directions: upward, downward, leftward, and rightward. The cost of the movement in each direction is:<P><OL><LI>The cost for moving the treasure upward is $10 per meter. </LI><LI>The cost for moving the treasure downward is $2 per meter. </LI><LI>The cost for moving the treasure leftward is $5 per meter. </LI><LI>The cost for moving the treasure rightward is $5 per meter. </LI></OL><P><P><BR>For simplicity, in this problem, we only consider a 2D map that uses the rectangular coordinate system (one meter per unit in both <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> axis), and the origin of the rectangular coordinate system is on the left-bottom corner of the map. In addition, each obstacle/treasure rectangle is described by its left-bottom vertex and its right-top vertex; and the destination of the treasure is given by the position of the left-bottom vertex of the first treasure rectangle. For instance in Figure 1, there are two obstacles: (2,4)-(6,7) and (8,1)-(11,5), and the treasure is a combination of the two rectangles: (1,1)(3,2) and (2,0)-(3,1). The destination is indicated by (10,6), which is the destined position of the left-bottom vertex of the first treasure rectangle.<P>Figure 2 illustrates a sample solution of this example. In the solution, the treasure is moved rightward 5 meters first, and then moved upward 5 meters. Finally, it is moved rightward 4 meters to arrive the destination location. Therefore, the total cost for the movement is <SPAN CLASS="MATH">5&#215;5 + 5&#215;10 + 4&#215;5 = 95</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

<P><P><BR>Seen as an engineering undertaking for the opening decades of the 21st century, the space elevator proposal was highlighted during the 2002 Space and Robotics Conferences. In 2108, after a sequence of technology breakthroughs, the dream of traveling from Earth to outer space with an elevator finally comes to reality. A space elevator made of a <SPAN CLASS="textit">carbon nanotubes composite ribbon</SPAN> anchored to an offshore sea platform stretches to a small counterweight approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km) into space. Mechanical lifters attached to the ribbon could then climb the ribbon, carrying cargo and humans into space. Carbon nanotubes have the potential to be 100 times stronger than steel and are as flexible as plastic. The strength of carbon nanotubes comes from their unique structure, which resembles soccer balls.<P>To better understand the concept of a space elevator, think of the game tetherball in which a rope is attached at one end to a pole and at the other to a ball. In this analogy, the rope is the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon, the pole is the Earth and the ball is the counterweight. Now, imagine the ball is placed in perpetual spin around the pole, so fast that it keeps the rope taut. This is the general idea of the space elevator. The counterweight spins around the Earth, keeping the cable straight and allowing the robotic lifters to ride up and down the ribbon.<P>Air Climber Motor (ACM), a space-infrastucture company, has been among those who support construction of a space elevator. ACM provides various of services to maintain the functionality of the space elevator. A crew of ACM routinely travels along the ribbon up and down at unit speed to serve the tourists and scientists at various stops, which are set up for spectacular sightseeing or scientific activities. ACM makes profits out of serving the requests at the stops. If the crew serves stop <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> at time <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, then the revenue collected equals <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>x</SUB> - <I>t</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, where we assume the service can be done instantly and ignore the service time.<P>We use the following diagram to illustrate the space elevator with a horizontal line, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>'s and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I><SUB>j</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>'s are positive integers (except <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I><SUB>0</SUB> = <I>y</I><SUB>0</SUB> = 0</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> as the origin) to indicate the locations of stops and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>x<SUB>i</SUB></SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>'s, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>y<SUB>j</SUB></SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>'s are the profits for the corresponding services at the stops. Initially, the crew starts at the origin. We refer to the stops right of the origin as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>,..., <I>x</I><SUB>r</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and those to the left as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I><SUB>1</SUB>,..., <I>y</I><SUB>q</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Both sequences are in increasing order.

A bonus plan is one of the most effective tools to motivate employees, therefore most companies take it seriously to decide the amount of the bonus for each employee. BonBonus is a company striving on automatic bonuses calculation software and serves many international companies. For international companies, each employee has two reporting lines, one for the regional office and the other for the functional head. And each employee's performance is based on the evaluations of the regional office and the functional head. For example, Mr. Doe is working in Taiwan office as a marketing manager, then his bonus is decided by the evaluations of Taiwan office and the marketing division in the head quarter. 

<P>
Let us skip all the complicated details of the bonus calculation. The final output of the BonBonus program is a two dimensional <!-- MATH
 $m \times n$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I>&#215;<I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> table, where each row corresponds to a region and each column corresponds to a functional coding, and the entry in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I><SUB>i, j</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the bonus for the employee in the region <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and for the function <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. As usual, there is no negative bonus. Naturally, the row sums and column sums are the performance for regions and functions. Companies usually announce the performance of regions and functions while they keep the individual's bonus secret. 

<P>
BonBonus was doing very well until a phone call brought the stormy bad news. A company ran the BonBonus program and happily announced the performance for each region and each function. Later, they found out that the entries in the table were not all integers, it had at most two digits after the decimal point. ``Not every country has cents! And we have already announced the performance for regions and functions," shouted at the other end of the phone line. ``Didn't you notice the fractional number problem when you announced them?" asked the BonBonus chief technology officer. ``The row sums and column sums are all integers!" replied with the mixture of anger and amusement. ``How may I help you?" explored the CTO. ``You make all the entries integers! Keep the row sums and column sums intact. And moreover, the difference between the final adjusted bonus and the true bonus must be strictly less than one! And you have 24 hours to fix the problem." That was the last sentence of the phone call. As you had expected, many companies do business in countries without cents. The phone calls rushed in and you, the guru of programming, was called in. ``You fix the problem," demanded the CTO. ``But, sir. Can it be fixed?" you asked. ``If it cannot be fixed, then you have an even bigger problem," said the CTO. You remained silent as if you were pondering. ``Fix it and you will get a bonus which will make you beyond happiness." ``Okay, sir. I will try my best." You are to write a program to solve the problem above.

<P>In computational complexity theory, polynomial-time reduction is an important concept.<P>If the existence of a polynomial-time algorithm for problem <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> implies that problem <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> also has a polynomial-time algorithm, we say that problem <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> has a polynomial-time reduction to problem <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The relation of reduction is transitive, i.e. if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> has a reduction to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> has a reduction to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, then <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> has a reduction to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.<P>Theoretical computer science researchers have found hundreds of polynomial-time reductions between problems, which build a large network of reductions in computational complexity theory.<P>In this network, some reductions are explicitly presented and others exist implicitly. For example, if the reductions from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> are explicitly presented and the reduction from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is not explicitly presented, we say that the reduction from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> exists implicitly.<P>In fact, some reductions are not necessary to present explicitly in the network.

A problem that has received considerable attention over the years is that of transforming a name into some code that tends to bring together all the variants of the same name. This is useful in applications involving spoken names when there is a good chance that the name will be misspelled. The following `soundex' algorithm, which was originally developed by Margaret K. Odell and Robert C. Russell, has often been used for encoding surnames. Assume the input is a single name consisting of only upper or lower case alphabetic characters with no punctuation, and that case is not significant in alphabetic comparisons. 

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Retain the first letter of the name (in upper case), and drop all occurrences of a, e, h, i, o ,u, w, and y in other positions of the name.

As our first example, suppose we want the code for the name `Euler'. In step 1 we retain the first E, but drop the u and the second e, yielding `Elr'. In step 2 we assign codes to l and r, yielding E46. Step 3 doesn't apply in this case. In step 4 we must add an additional 0 to obtain the desired letter, digit, digit, digit format, so our final code is E460. 

<P>
Now consider generating the code for `Gauss'. We keep the G and drop the a and the u, yielding `Gss'. After step 2 we have G22. In step 3 we note that the two `2' codes were yielded by two occurrences of `s' in the original name, so we keep only one, yielding G2. Finally, we add two zeroes to give the final code, G200.

<P>The newly liberated country of Freedestan is preparing for its first democratic elections. Your company has won the bid for providing election automation to Freedestan and has been contracted by the Freedestani Election Council (FEC) to develop a ballot counting machine to be used in this election. Your software team is tasked with developing the Ballot Analysis and Result Recording (BARR) software module of the machine.<P>Your BARR module will be extensively tested by FEC representatives to ensure accuracy and compliance with the FEC rules and regulations. The tests will be performed using a series of ballots from several sample elections as input.<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Unmarked Ballot Format</SPAN><P>An unmarked ballot consists of one or more text lines, each of which contains the following:<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>OfficeName</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark><TT>:</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Candidate</I>1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Candidate</I>2</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> ... <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>CandidateN</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark><P><P><BR>This indicates that the individuals with names ` <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Candidate</I>1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>', ` <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Candidate</I>2</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>', ...and ` <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>CandidateN</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>' are running for office ` <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>OfficeName</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>'. The name of each office and the name of each candidate will contain at least two characters. Whitespace (blanks and/or tabs) will appear before each candidate's name and may optionally follow the last candidate's name. The names of candidates for an office may appear in different orders on different ballots, although the names of all candidates will be present. The lines for offices are presented in the same order on each ballot, which is in descending order of importance -- the line for the most important office appears first and the line for the least important office appears last. Each office has at least one candidate.<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Marking a Ballot</SPAN><P>A voter properly selects a candidate for an office by placing a single `<TT>X</TT>' or `<TT>x</TT>' in the space immediately preceding the name of that candidate on the ballot so that some whitespace appears before and after the `' or `<TT>x</TT>'. For example, the line<P><P><BR>President<TT>: X</TT> Amabo Gomaa<P><P><BR>indicates a vote for the candidate `Amabo' for the office of `President'. Unfortunately, it is also possible for a voter to place additional `<TT>X</TT>' or `<TT>x</TT>' marks on a line, and even other single-character marks. The ballot marking mechanism guarantees that there will always be some whitespace on each side of each voter-placed mark, and that marks must appear after the colon following the name of the office. Ballot lines containing more than one mark, or any mark other than `<TT>X</TT>' or `<TT>x</TT>' will cause the ballot containing that line to be flagged for examination by an election official. All ballot lines will be counted if they contain only a single `<TT>X</TT>' or `<TT>x</TT>' mark properly preceding the name of a candidate, even on ballots flagged for examination.<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Tallying the Election Results</SPAN><P>A candidate may run for one or more offices, but may only win election to one office. A candidate wins election to an office if he/she receives the most valid votes for that office, and has not been elected to or tied for a more important office. In case of a tie, all tied candidates for that office will be identified in the election results; each tied candidate is also ineligible for election to a less important office. It is possible that no candidates remain eligible for an office after applying these rules.

If you visit historical battlegrounds from periods when cannon were used, you may see cannonballs (metal spheres) stacked in various ways. In this problem we're interested in the number of cannonballs in such pyramids with triangular bases  --  that is, with cannonballs arranged in an equilateral triangle on the base, then similar equilateral triangles of cannonballs stacked on top of that, until a single cannonball is placed on the top. This three-sided pyramid is, in fact, one of the Platonic solids, a tetrahedron. 

<P>
For example, suppose we begin with a base containing 6 cannonballs arranged in an equilateral triangle as shown in the figure on the left; this equilateral triangle has 3 cannonballs on each edge. The next layer will contain 3 cannonballs, 2 on each edge  --  as shown in the middle. The final layer always contains just one cannonball. The total number of cannonballs in this pyramid is thus 6 + 3 + 1 = 10. In general, each layer of such a pyramid will have one fewer cannonballs on each edge of the triangle than the next lower layer.

<P>Patrick has a four function calculator; unfortunately his sister has decided to be a traditional `evil sibling' and has painted over the display. The calculator still functions, but of course you can't see the results. This calculator has a display constructed from seven-segment LEDs. The figure on the left below illustrates how the seven LED segments at each digit position are arranged. The figure on the right shows which segments are illuminated to display each of the ten decimal digits.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="1346" HEIGHT="538" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/p4282.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4282.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>This particular calculator only displays three digits of accuracy. There are three seven segment digits, and there are no decimal points since all math is performed using integers (with truncation where appropriate).<P>If the number on the display happens to be negative, there is a minus sign in front of the number. For a number such as -6, this is done by making the rightmost digit a `6' and using the middle segment of the next digit over as the minus sign. For a number such as -123, there is one additional segment to the left of the display. Thus, the number -112 lights up 10 segments, made up of 9 for the number, and one more for the minus sign. The display thus ranges from `-999' to `999'. There is no `plus sign' for positive numbers.<P>In order to prove that the calculator still operates, and justify scraping off the paint, the back cover is removed and an ammeter is attached to the display. An ammeter measures the current consumed by the device, and each segment of a digit consumes 5 milliamps. Thus, to display a number such as `798' the current consumption can be predicted as follows:<P><P><BR>Digit 7 -- 3 segments lit = 15 milliamps<BR>Digit 9 -- 6 segments lit = 30 milliamps<BR>Digit 8 -- 7 segments lit = 35 milliamps<BR>Total = 80 milliamps<P><P><BR>Of course, it's apparent that the number `897' also consumes the same amount of current, as does `789' or, for that matter, `-891'.<P>The calculator allows you to enter numbers with an optional minus sign and up to three digits, and to either add, subtract, multiply, or divide the numbers. Patrick wishes to prove that the functionality of the calculator is intact, so he enters `949' and measures 80 milliamps. Then he pushes the subtract key. Next he enters `51' and measures 35 milliamps. After pressing the `=' key the result should be `898', measuring 100 milliamps. As a second example, he enters `-5', then pushes the addition key. He then enters `-4' and presses equal. The answer is `-9'; the measurements were 30 milliamps, 25 milliamps, and 35 milliamps respectively.<P>Patrick's sister claims that this is a trick, so she presents him with the following problem: given the current consumption (in milliamps) of operand X, operand Y, and result Z, and given an unknown operation Op, determine the number of possible values for X Op Y = Z, assuming that possible solutions exist. If no such solutions exist, the answer is `<TT>No solutions.</TT>'<P>Note that in all cases, there are only three digits on the display. Although the input values of 80, 35, and 100 potentially could represent <SPAN CLASS="MATH">12337 = 949*13</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, this is not possible because 12337 is too large for the three digit display to hold.<P><P><BR><B>Example</B><P>An example is as shown above; for inputs 80, 35, and 100 one possibility is ` <SPAN CLASS="MATH">925 - 117 = 808</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>'. Some input combinations may have no result. For the inputs 35, 10, and 10 the answer is `<TT>No solutions.</TT>' For any given input set, the program should either print `<TT>No solutions.</TT>' or it should print the number of solutions found.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>There will be multiple cases.

<P>We are all familiar with the traditional binary search tree (BST) in all of its variants. There are AVL trees, red-black trees, etc. In each, the search strategy is the same -- if the key of the item for which we are searching is less than the key in the tree node we are examining, then the search should proceed down the left sub-tree, if it exists. Likewise, if the key is greater than that in this tree node, search the right sub-tree. Suppose we call the key associated with a node <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and the key for which we are searching <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Then if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I> &lt; <I>V</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> go to the left, and if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I> &gt; <I>V</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> go to the right.

All comparisons should be done using integer arithmetic and truncation, so that a node with a value 9 would have a `far left' sub-tree that contains only nodes with keys less than 4, and a `near left' sub-tree that contains nodes with keys greater than or equal to 4 and strictly less than 9.<P>Assume the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">level</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> of a tree node is zero for the root of the tree, one for nodes immediately below the root, and so on.

<P>Ancient Egyptian multiplication is a systematic method for multiplying two numbers that does not require the multiplication table, only the ability to multiply by 2, and to add. Also known as Egyptian multiplication and Peasant multiplication, it decomposes one of the multiplicands into a sum of powers of two and creates a table of doublings of the second multiplicand. This method may be called mediation and duplication, where mediation means halving one number and duplication means doubling the other number.<P>This method has three phases: the decomposition, the table and the result.<P>The <SPAN CLASS="textbf">decomposition</SPAN> of a number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> thus consists of finding the powers of two which make it up. The Egyptians knew empirically that a given power of two would only appear once in a number. For the decomposition, they proceeded methodically; they would initially find the largest power of two less than or equal to the number in question, subtract it out and repeat until nothing remained. (The Egyptians did not make use of the number zero in mathematics).<P><P><BR><B>Example:</B> First consider the decomposition of the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = 13</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>:<UL><LI>the largest power of two less than or equal to 13 is 8, 13 - 8 = 5, </LI><LI>the largest power of two less than or equal to 5 is 4, 5 - 4 = 1, </LI><LI>the largest power of two less than or equal to 1 is 1, 1 - 1 = 0 </LI></UL><P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = 13</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is thus the sum of the powers of two: 8, 4 and 1.<P>After the decomposition of the first multiplicand (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>), it is necessary to construct a <SPAN CLASS="textbf">table</SPAN> of powers of two times the second multiplicand (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) from one up to the largest power of two found during the decomposition. In the table, a line is obtained by multiplying the preceding line by two.<P>For example, if the largest power of two found during the decomposition of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = 13</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is 8 and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I> = 238</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the table is created as follows:<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=2 BORDER FRAME=BOX RULES=GROUPS><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>Power of 2</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I>&#215;</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> Power of 2</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>*1</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>238</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>2</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>476</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>*4</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>952</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>*8</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>1904</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="textbf"><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> = 13</SPAN></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="textbf"><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I>&#215;<I>M</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> = 3094</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P><P><BR>Finally, the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">result</SPAN> is obtained by adding the numbers from the second column for which the corresponding power of two makes up part of the decomposition of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> (denoted by a mark).<P>Thus, the result of the multiplication of 13 <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&#215;</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> 238 is obtained as the addition of: 1904 + 952 + 238 = 3094 <SPAN CLASS="textbf">or</SPAN> 238 + 952 + 1904 = 3094.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>The input consists of multiple test cases.

<h3>Time limit: 2 seconds</h3--><p><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/p4286.jpg> A mobile is a type of kinetic sculpture constructed to take advantage of the principle of equilibrium. It consists of a number of rods, from which weighted objects or further rods hang. The objects hanging from the rods balance each other, so that the rods remain more or less horizontal. Each rod hangs from only one string, which gives it freedom to rotate about the string.</p><p>We consider mobiles where each rod is attached to its string exactly in the middle, as in the figure underneath. You are given such a configuration, but the weights on the ends are chosen incorrectly, so that the mobile is not in equilibrium. Since that's not aesthetically pleasing, you decide to change some of the weights.</p><center><img class="figure" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/p4286.jpg></center><p>What is the minimum number of weights that you must change in order to bring the mobile to equilibrium? You may substitute any weight by any (possibly non-integer) weight. For the mobile shown in the figure, equilibrium can be reached by changing the middle weight from 7 to 3, so only 1 weight needs to changed.</p><h2>Input</h2>On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100. After that per testcase:<ul><li>One line with the structure of the mobile, which is a recursively defined expression of the form:<pre>
  &lt;expr&gt; ::= &lt;weight&gt; | "[" &lt;expr&gt; "," &lt;expr&gt; "]"</pre>with <tt>&lt;weight&gt;</tt> a positive integer smaller than 10<sup>9</sup> indicating a weight and <tt>[&lt;expr&gt;,&lt;expr&gt;]</tt> indicating a rod with the two expressions at the ends of the rod. The total number of rods in the chain from a weight to the top of the mobile will be at most 16.</ul><h2>Output</h2>Per testcase:<ul><li>One line with the minimum number of weights that have to be changed.</ul><div class="sample"><h2>Sample Input</h2><pre>

<h3>Time limit: 5 seconds</h3--><p>Consider the following exercise, found in a generic linear algebra textbook.</p><blockquote>Let <em>A</em> be an <em>n</em> &times; <em>n</em> matrix. Prove that the following statements are equivalent:<ol type="a"><li><em>A</em> is invertible. <li><em>Ax = b</em> has exactly one solution for every <em>n</em> &times; 1 matrix <em>b</em>. <li><em>Ax = b</em> is consistent for every <em>n</em> &times; 1 matrix <em>b</em>. <li><em>Ax = 0</em> has only the trivial solution <em>x</em> = 0.</ol></blockquote><p>The typical way to solve such an exercise is to show a series of implications. For instance, one can proceed by showing that (a) implies (b), that (b) implies (c), that (c) implies (d), and finally that (d) implies (a). These four implications show that the four statements are equivalent.</p><p>Another way would be to show that (a) is equivalent to (b) (by proving that (a) implies (b) and that (b) implies (a)), that (b) is equivalent to (c), and that (c) is equivalent to (d). However, this way requires proving six implications, which is clearly a lot more work than just proving four implications!</p><p>I have been given some similar tasks, and have already started proving some implications. Now I wonder, how many more implications do I have to prove? Can you help me determine this?</p><h2>Input</h2>On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100.

In this show, a bunch of cats and dogs compete for the very prestigious <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Best Pet Ever</span> title. In each episode, the cats and dogs get to show themselves off, after which the viewers vote on which pets should stay and which should be forced to leave the show.</p><p>Each viewer gets to cast a vote on two things: one pet which should be kept on the show, and one pet which should be thrown out.

<h3>Time limit: 4 seconds</h3--><p>Once upon a time, there was an <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">nwerc</span> judge with a tendency to create slightly too hard problems. As a result, his problems were never solved. As you can image, this made our judge somewhat frustrated. This year, this frustration has culminated, and he has decided that rather than spending a lot of time constructing a well-crafted problem, he will simply write some insanely hard problem statement and just generate some random input and output files. After all, why bother having proper test data if nobody is going to try the problem anyway?</p><p>Thus, the judge generates a testcase by simply letting the input be a random number, and letting the output be another random number. Formally, to generate the data set with <em>T</em> test cases, the judge generates 2<em>T</em> random numbers <em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, ..., <em>x</em><sub>2<em>T</em></sub> between 0 and 10000, and then writes <em>T</em>, followed by the sequence <em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>3</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>5</sub>, ..., <em>x</em><sub>2<em>T</em>-1</sub> to the input file, and the sequence <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>4</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>6</sub>, ..., <em>x</em><sub>2<em>T</em></sub> to the output file.</p><p>The random number generator the judge uses is quite simple. He picks three numbers <em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>a</em>, and <em>b</em> between 0 and 10000 (inclusive), and then for <em>i</em> from 2 to 2<em>T</em> lets <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> = (<em>a</em> &middot; <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em>-1</sub> + <em>b</em>) mod 10001.<p>You may have thought that such a poorly designed problem would not be used in a contest of such high standards as <span style="font-variant:

To make more people able to climb the mountain and enjoy the view, we would like to make the climb easier.</p><p>To do so, we will model the mountain as follows: the mountain consists of <em>n</em> adjacent stacks of stones, and each of the stacks is <em>h<sub>i</sub></em> high.

<h3>Time limit: 4 seconds</h3--><p><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/p4291.jpg> Imagine a box, made of copper plate. Imagine a second one, intersecting the first one, and several others, intersecting each other (or not). That is how the sculptor Oto Boxing constructs his sculptures. In fact he does not construct that much, he only makes the design; the actual construction is contracted out to a construction company. For the calculation of the costs of construction the company needs to know the total area of copper plate involved. Parts of a box that are hidden in another box are not realized in copper, of course. (Copper is quite expensive, and prices are rising.) After construction, the total construction is plunged into a bath of chemicals. To prevent this bath from running over, the construction company wants to know the total volume of the construction. Given that a construction is a collection of boxes, you are asked to calculate the area and the volume of the construction.</p><p>Some of Oto's designs are connected, others are not. Either way, we want to know the total area and the total volume. It might happen that the boxes completely enclose space that is not included in any of the boxes (see the second example below). Because the liquid cannot enter that space, its volume must be added to the total volume. Copper plate bordering this space is superfluous, of course, so it does not add to the area.</p><h2>Input</h2>On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100.

<h3>Time limit: 15 seconds</h3--><p>Videopoker is the slot machine variant of the currently immensely popular game of poker. It is a variant on draw poker. In this game the player gets a hand consisting of five cards randomly drawn from a standard 52-card deck. From this hand, the player may discard any number of cards (between 0 and 5, inclusive), and change them for new cards randomly drawn from the remainder of the deck. After that, the hand is evaluated and the player is rewarded according to a payout structure. A common payout structure is as follows:</p><center><table><tr><th>Hand</th><th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><th>Payout</th></tr><tr><td>one pair</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>two pair</td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>three of a kind</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>straight</td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>flush</td><td></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>full house</td><td></td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>four of a kind</td><td></td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>straight flush</td><td></td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>royal flush</td><td></td><td>250</td></tr></table></center><p>Once you know the payout structure, you can determine for a given hand which cards you must change to maximize your expected reward. We'd like to know this expected reward, given a hand.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100. After that per testcase:</p><ul><li>One line with nine integers <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> (0 &le; <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> &le; 1000$) describing the payout structure. The numbers are in increasing order and describe the payout for one pair, two pair, etc, until the royal flush. <li>One line with one integer <em>n</em> (1 &le; <em>n</em> &le; 10): the number of starting hands to follow. <li><em>n</em> lines, each describing a starting hand. A hand consists of five space separated tokens of the form <tt>Xs</tt>, with <tt>X</tt> being the rank (`<tt>2</tt>' \dots `<tt>9</tt>', `<tt>T</tt>', `<tt>J</tt>', `<tt>Q</tt>', `<tt>K</tt>' or `<tt>A</tt>') and <tt>s</tt> being the suit (`<tt>c</tt>', `<tt>d</tt>', `<tt>h</tt>' or `<tt>s</tt>').</ul><h2>Output</h2><p>Per testcase:</p><ul><li>One line for each starting hand with a floating point number that is the maximal expected reward for that hand. These numbers must have an absolute or relative error less than 10<sup>-6</sup>.</ul><div class="sample"><h2>Sample Input</h2><pre>

Frequently, groups of knights gather around the country to compare their skills. On such a typical contest day, everyone has five hours to do ten disciplines, such as sword fighting, bow and arrow, and various forms of horseback riding. Needless to say, you have to bring your own horse.<P>This is not as easy as it seems. It often takes a knight several days to go from the castle where he lives to the place where a tournament is held. But horses sometimes are very, very stubborn. After having covered a certain distance on a single day, they sometimes simply stop and refuse to go any further. Luckily, they start anew on the next day. To make sure that the horse does not refuse service before the scheduled day trip is completed, a knight wants to choose an itinerary on which the longest day trip is as short as possible. Hence, a trip that takes many days with short distances is preferable over a shorter route that has the risk of a refusing horse.<BR><P>Write a program which answers queries from knights spread all over the country about the best way to go from their castles to a tournament site. Given a description of the relevant places (i.e. castles, locations of tournaments, and hostels for overnight stays), the program should tell them the largest distance they have to cover on a single day so that this distance is minimal among all possible itineraries.<P>The places are designated by consecutive integers from 1 to <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/aimg1.gif ALT="$ N$">, while a road is represented by three integers, namely its place of origin, its destination, and its length. Every road can be used in both directions, and there is at least one route (i.e. a sequence of roads) between any two places. The knights stick to the given roads while travelling and spend their nights only at one of the <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/aimg1.gif ALT="$ N$"> places.<P><BR><BR><B>Input</B><BR>The first line contains the total number of test cases that follow.<P>Each test case begins with a line that first holds the number <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/aimg1.gif ALT="$ N$"> of places ( <IMG WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/aimg1.gif ALT="$ 1 \le N \le 3000$"> ) followed by the number <IMG WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/aimg1.gif ALT="$ R$"> of roads ( <IMG WIDTH="114" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/aimg1.gif ALT="$ 1 \le R \le

Competitive as they are, they occasionally engage in a little open-air sword fight, just to determine who among them really is the first knight. Of course, neither Adalbert nor Archibald wins, but they keep themselves busy for quite a while and get around in the surroundings. You have to calculate about how long their next `fight' will last.<P>All the action takes place in a rectangular area which, for the sake of simplicity, is divided into unit squares numbered from <IMG WIDTH="39" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/bimg1.gif ALT="$ (1,1)$"> to <IMG WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/bimg1.gif ALT="$ (m,n)$"> . Starting at <IMG WIDTH="39" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/bimg1.gif ALT="$ (1,1)$"> , the knights move from one square to one of the at most four adjacent squares, and finish as soon as they reach <IMG WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/bimg1.gif ALT="$ (m,n)$"> where the tavern is located. At each square, it is largely a matter of chance where the fight will continue, but it also depends on the environment (for example, if a certain direction is uphill). Our model uses probabilities to decide into which adjacent square the fight will move next. (For example, an uphill direction has a lower probability.) It is your job to calculate the expected number of moves that are needed before the tavern is reached. You can assume that every move is independent of the directions chosen in the previous moves.<P><BR><BR><B>Input</B><BR>The input consists of a sequence of rectangular areas.

The burgrave of Nuremberg comes to the conclusion that the winding streets of the city are a mess. Thus, he plans to rebuild the whole city in a much larger space with rectangular streets that are parallel to his favourite coordinate system.<BR><P>It is well known that craftsmen belonging to different guilds should better be living in separate quarters of the city. Of course not all guilds have the same <I>reputation</I> and the quarters for the guilds are to be ordered by reputation. The quarters should also be ordered by the <I>importance</I> for the economy of the city, just to be able to evacuate - in case of an enemy attack or a fire - more important people first. Note that <I>importance</I> is not the same as <I>reputation</I>: e.g. whereas people working in finance have about the lowest possible reputation, they are still important for the economy of the city. In contrast, clerics have a high reputation although the economy could do quite well without them.<BR>The burgrave places the quarter of a guild with reputation <IMG WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/cimg1.gif ALT="$ i$"> and importance <IMG WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/cimg1.gif ALT="$ j$"> in the corresponding square with coordinates <IMG WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/cimg1.gif ALT="$ [i, i + 1[ \times [j, j + 1[$"> , where <IMG WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/cimg1.gif ALT="$ i$"> and <IMG WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/cimg1.gif ALT="$ j$"> are integers.

The price of every letter should be the same for all connections within the city. To find a fair price that covers the transportation costs, the burgrave needs to know the average path length of all the mail. A survey has shown that all connections are equally likely with the following exception: Nobody would ever consider to write a letter to someone of a guild with lower or equal reputation or importance than his own. We call a path between two houses admissible if it is not excluded by this condition (see figure on the next page).<BR><P><BR><BR><B>Input</B><BR>The input consists of several test cases, separated from each other by a blank line.

The new term has just begun, so there are a lot of freshmen around. Not everyone has been lucky to be admitted to her/his desired university. As a result, many couples are now living in separate towns.<P>Of course, they try to see each other as often as they can. To facilitate this, the students have negotiated a deal with the coachmen. Instead of paying the regular price for a ride from one town to another, the price is determined by drawing a random integer between 1 and <IMG WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/42/dimg1.gif ALT="$ R$"> inclusive, all numbers being equally likely. Unfortunately, this process repeats itself a few times whenever there is no direct connection between the towns a couple lives in. That makes the total cost of a journey quite unpredictable.<P>Help the couples determine the probability that one of them can afford a one-way trip to the other one. Given the number of towns and a list of direct connections, your program is supposed to process a list of couples. For each couple, you know their budget and where they live. Of course, they will always choose a route with the least expected price.

My wife allows me to travel around only if I return home with a nice, foreign gift in my hands. The <I>game</I>, which was my most recent present to her, was a really fascinating one.<BR><P>The basic rules of the game are fairly simple: The game is played by exactly two players. In front of each player there is a fixed number of mugs and a bowl on the right side of the mugs. The mugs and bowls are arranged in a circle.<BR><P>A number of stones is placed in each mug. The numbers of stones in the bowls are the scores of the corresponding players. The players alternate in making turns. In each turn, the current player selects one of his non-empty mugs. The stones are removed from the selected mug and are spread over the neighbouring mugs and bowls as follows: If there are <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/eimg1.gif ALT="$ N$"> stones in the selected mug, one stone is added to each of the following <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/eimg1.gif ALT="$ N$"> mugs/bowls in a counter-clockwise direction. Stones in the bowls count as scored points and cannot be removed in any further turn.<BR><P>The following figure shows a turn in the mid of a game:<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="game"></A><A NAME="132"></A><TABLE><CAPTION ALIGN="BOTTOM"><STRONG>Fig.:</STRONG> Board with 3 mugs for each player, scores are 3:4 before the turn and 4:4 after afterwards.</CAPTION><TR><TD><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/eimg1.gif width="300px" /> <IMG SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/eimg1.gif width="300px" /></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></DIV><P>If the last stone of a selected mug is added to the own <I>bowl</I>, the player gets an extra move. This extra move may result in additional extra moves (there is no limit for the number of extra moves).<BR><P>If, on the other hand, the last stone is added to a mug of the opponent, the player has the option (not the obligation) to swap the opponent's mug with his <I>corresponding mug</I> (mugs <IMG WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/eimg1.gif ALT="$ A$"> and <IMG WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/eimg1.gif ALT="$ a$"> , mugs <IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/eimg1.gif ALT="$ B$"> and <IMG WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/eimg1.gif ALT="$ b$"> , ...). Swapping is only allowed if the own mug is not empty. If he chooses to swap, then both mugs must not be swapped for the following four turns.

This rule does not result in an extra move. Note that in general the <I>opposite</I> mug is different from the <I>corresponding</I> mug: Mugs <IMG WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/eimg1.gif ALT="$ A$"> and <IMG WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/eimg1.gif ALT="$ c$"> , mugs <IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/eimg1.gif ALT="$ B$"> and <IMG WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/eimg1.gif ALT="$ b$"> , and mugs <IMG WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/eimg1.gif ALT="$ C$"> and <IMG WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/eimg1.gif ALT="$ a$"> are considered as opposite mugs in the above example.<BR><P>The game ends as soon as every mug is empty and all stones are in the two bowls. If a player cannot move because all of his mugs are empty, but the opponent can move, it is the opponent's turn again. (With respect to the swapping rule above, the inactivity of the player who cannot move does count as a turn, too.) Otherwise, if a player can move, he has to choose one of the allowed moves.<BR><P>Can you help me with the following question: What is the best difference between my final score and my opponent's final score that I can achieve from a given situation?

<P>
In the year 2048 the IT community in Mars is planning to send exploration trips to find new galaxies. In order to be eligible, astronauts need to be member of the Galactic Training Program (GTP). In order to take a training course the astronaut must complain with two requirements. First the astronaut must at least have 180 days as member of the GTP, and he must have an "A" (Alfa) certification. If both requirements are met the astronaut is accepted, in other cases the astronaut is not accepted to take the training course. Your task is to read the astronauts information and determine which astronauts are accepted and assign them a number starting in 1. Do these for each group and simulation date provided.

<P>A binary clock is a clock which displays traditional sexagesimal time in a binary format. The most common binary clock uses six columns of LEDs to represent zeros and ones. Each column represents a single decimal digit, a format known as binary-coded decimal (BCD).

In the 17th century, with thunderous noise, dense smoke and blazing fire, battles on the sea were just the same as those in the modern times. But at that time, the cannon were extremely simple. It was just like an iron cylinder, with its rearward end sealed and forward end open. There was a small hole at the rearward end of it, which was used to install the fuse. The cannons on the warships were put on small vehicles which had four wheels and the shells were iron spheres with gunpowder in them. 

<P>
At that time, it was said that there was an intelligent captain, who was also a mathematician amateur. He liked to connect everything him met to mathematics. Before every battle, he often ordered the soldiers to put the shells on the deck and make those shells to form shell pyramids. 

<P>
Now letâs suppose that a shell pyramid has four layers, and there will be a sequence of ordinal numbers in every layer. They are as the following figure:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<!-- MATH
 $\epsfbox{p4312.eps}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="751" HEIGHT="203" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/p4312.png
 ALT="\epsfbox{p4312.eps}">
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>
</DIV>

<P>
In the figure, they are the first layer, the second layer, the third layer and the fourth layer respectively from the left to the right. 

<P>
In the first layer, there is just 1 shell, and its ordinal number is 1. In the second layer, there are 3 shells, and their ordinal numbers are 1, 2, and 3. In the third layer, there are 6 shells, and their ordinal numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. In the fourth layer, there are 10 shells, and their ordinal numbers are shown in the figure above. 

<P>
There are also serial numbers for the whole shell pyramid. For example, the serial number for the third shell in the second layer is 4, the serial number for the fifth shell in the third layer is 9, and the serial number for the ninth shell in the fourth layer is 19. 

<P>
There is also a interrelated problem: If given one serial number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, then we can work out the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th shell is in what layer, what row and what column. Assume that the layer number is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the row number is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and the column number is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, therefore, if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I> = 9</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, then <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> = 4</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I> = 4</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> = 3</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Now let us continue to tell about the story about the captain. 

<P>
A battle was going to begin. The captain allotted the same amount of shells to every cannon. The shells were piled on the deck which formed the same shell pyramids by the cannon. While the enemy warships were near, the captain ordered to fire simultaneously. Thunderous sound then was heard. The captain listened carefully, then he knew that how many shells were used and how many were left. 

<P>
At the end of the battle, the captain won. During the break, he asked his subordinate a question: For a shell pyramid, if given the serial number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, how do you calculate the layer number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the row number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and column number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>?

<P>
For a shell pyramid which is big enough, a integer is given, and this integer is the serial number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I> &lt; 2<SUP>63</SUP></SPAN>

What a nice day! The sky is blue, and the sea is calm. It is a day that is suitable for marine navigation training. A training ship of a Naval Training School sails out from the naval port and arrives at a sea area. The navigation instructor is not only an expert in navigation but also an amateur mathematician. The instructor gives the practice assignment as soon as the first student stands at the position of the navigator: First, navigates 1 nautical mile to the east, and then 2 nautical miles to the south, finally 4 nautical miles to the west, and stops at a certain place. The first student accomplishes the task successfully. Then the second student takes the place, and the instructor gives him a new practice assignment: Firstly, navigates 1 nautical mile to the east, then 2 nautical miles to the south, and then 3 nautical miles to the west, finally 3 nautical miles to the north, and stops at a fixed place. Just like this, the students drive the training ship to accomplish the assignment one by one. There is a student who is interested in numbers and taking records. He writes down the first sequence 1, 2, and 4 as soon as the first student accepts the assignment. Later, he writes down the second sequence 1, 2, 3, and 6 when the second student accepts the assignment. As a mathematic lover, the student always connects the numbers to some mathematic problems. When he writes down the first sequence, 1, 2, and 4, he figures out that every number in the sequence is the divisors of 4, and 4 is also the last number in the sequence. When he writes down the second sequence 1, 2, 3 and 6, he also figures out that every number in the sequence is the divisors of 6, and 6 is also the last number in the sequence. After all the students have finished the assignment, the student looks at the record and comes to the conclusion followed: There is one thing in common for the assignments that the instructor has given to the students, that is, take the direction turning point as the gap, and the sailing distance in all directions form a sequence, every number in the sequence is the divisor of the last one.

The marine navigation training finishes. On the way back, the students have a good time, singing, talking, laughing, and appreciating the sea scenery. The student shows the instructor the records and tells him his findings. The instructor laughs and says to the student, ``Well done! You like taking records and thinking, and then finding out something from it. It is a good habit, and also a scientific habit." The instructor then continues, ``Just like science does not have limit, the scientific questions do not have limit, either. The question we have just discussed will not end, and we can also pose new questions." 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The following is the new question the instructor raises: 

<P>
First, we give a new definition: For a positive integer, if it has <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> different divisors, then it is called a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-dimension number. 

<P>
For instance, the positive integer 4 has three divisors, 1, 2and 4, so 4 is a 3-dimension number. The positive integer 6 has four divisors, 1, 2, 3and 6, so 6 is a 4-dimension number. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Now a question is posed: how to work out the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-dimension number? <!-- MATH
 $(n<10000, K_{max} \le 100$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>n</I> &lt; 10000, <I>K</I><SUB>max</SUB><IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/4313img1.png
 ALT="$ \le$">100</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, here <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I><SUB>max</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the greatest prime divisor of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>). And you can assume if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-dimension number, it doesn't exceed 3-dimension. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
For example, if it is required to work out the second 3-dimension number, that is to say when <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> = 2</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I> = 3</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, then the answer is 9. Because 4 is the first 3-dimension number, and 9 has three common divisors 1, 3 and 9. Therefore, 9 is the second 3-dimension number. 

<P>
The student thinks: if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> are small enough, we can work out easily. Otherwise, we have to turn to the computer for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> are too big to deal with. 

<P>
He begins to think it over on the ship.

<P>The ocean is a treasure house of resources and the development of human society comes to depend more and more on it. In order to develop and utilize marine resources, it is necessary to build mining stations on the sea. However, due to seabed mineral resources, the radio signal in the sea is often so weak that not all the mining stations can carry out direct communication. However communication is indispensable, every two mining stations must be able to communicate with each other (either directly or through other one or more mining stations). To meet the need of transporting the exploited resources up to the land to get put into use, there build <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> ports correspondently along the coast and every port can communicate with one or more mining stations directly.<P>Due to the fact that some mining stations can not communicate with each other directly, for the safety of the navigation for ships, ships are only allowed to sail between mining stations which can communicate with each other directly.<P>The mining is arduous and people do this job need proper rest (that is, to allow the ship to return to the port).

<P>
Li Zhixiang have already been in ``Friendship" ocean-going freighter for three months. The excitement has gradually disappeared. He stands on the board, holding the railing and watching the dazzling ocean in the sun silently. Day after day, the same scenery is monotonous and tasteless, even the merry seagulls following the freighter cannot arouse his interest. Hearing the footsteps behind, he turns back to see the old captain is coming towards him. The captain has understood his idea, however, he starts a new topic with the young man. 

<P>
``Do you know how far our voyage is?" The captain asks. Li Zhixiang feels ashamed because he can not answer. 
Then the captain says with a smile, ``5050 miles. Do you still remember the story of 5050?" This time the young man really blushes. The old captain continues saying: ``You definitely know the story of 5050. When the German mathematician, ``the prince of mathematicians", Gauss was 10 years old ...'' Young man remembers this story and goes on to tell, ``When Gauss was 10 years old, he could add a list of integers from 1 to 100 in a few seconds, which shocked the teachers." The old captain adds, ``Gauss has many other stories like this. When he entered the university at the age of 17, he was able to construct heptadecagon by compass and straightedge. His university teachers were also impressed by his ability. Not only could college graduate students fail to do it, but also they felt hard to understand Gauss's constructing process." 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
At this time, vice-captain greets the old captain. The old captain says to Li Zhixiang: ``Come over to my office tonight, let's continue the conversation." It is still calm and tranquil in the evening. The freighter travels smoothly on the sea in the silver moonlight. The captain tells the young man the following words. 

<P>
``Among the mathematicians through the ages, there are three greatest mathematicians: Archimedes, Newton and Gauss. 
Most of Gauss's mathematical achievements are difficult to understand. Nevertheless, there are some comparatively easy. 
For instance, when it comes to solving multivariate system of linear equations, there is a solution called 
``Gauss Elimination". In the navigation business, many problems can be solved by ``Gauss elimination". 
If you are interested in it, I will show you a simple question. Try it."

<P>A deep-sea salvage company found out that there was a sunken ship in some deep-sea area of the Pacific with a case of priceless treasure in it. The senior leaders concluded as followed:<P>There may be some sea monsters, they may cause some distraction. The company had some most advanced intelligent underwater robots. They were equipped with enough weapons to kill the monster.<P>After they research a map, they got information as follow (according to the Sample Input): `<TT>S</TT>' indicated the starting place. `<TT>E</TT>' indicated the place of the treasure case. `<TT>D</TT>' indicated the doors of the rooms in the ship. `<TT>K</TT>' indicated the keys which were needed while opening the doors. `<TT>H</TT>' indicated the stairs went up. `<TT>L</TT>' indicated the stairs went down. `<TT>#</TT>' indicated the walls which separated the rooms. Every lowercase in the map indicated a monster.<P>The enclosed space formed by the doors and the walls was called a separated room. Entering a room needed a key `<TT>K</TT>' to open a door `<TT>D</TT>'. After that, the key could not be used any more, the door would be open for ever, and there would be no need to use the key. The total number of rooms in the ship was not exceeding 30, the total number of the monsters in the ship was not exceeding 26, and the number of the monsters in each room would not exceed 3. There was no monster in the rooms where `<TT>S</TT>' and `<TT>E</TT>', `<TT>H</TT>' and `<TT>L</TT>' were in.<P>The advanced intelligent underwater robot carried a machine gun whose cartridge clip capacity was 100 bullets and enough spare ammunition. It could re-load the bullets if given a chance. The surface of its body was equipped with 100 components. If all the components were destroyed while fighting with the monster, the robot could not function any more and would sink into the sea for ever. If only a part of the components was destroyed, the robot could recover if given a chance.The robot could attack the monsters in two ways; one is feign attack, and the other fierce attack. The feign attack would cause 1 reduction of the monsters' life value, and the fierce attack would cause a certain amount of deduction of the monsters' life value according to the degree of the fierce attack. The robot had 10 kinds of fierce attack tactics at most. Every attack tactics differed in bullet consumption and the certain reduction of the monsters' life value. For example, a certain kind of attack tactics would consume 30 bullets, and reduce 35 life value of the monster.<P>The life of the monster was so limited that when the injuries accumulated to a certain amount it would be killed. Suppose its life value was 100, and every attack would reduce a certain amount of life value.<P>When robot enters the treasure vessel, it searches the rooms one by one. As soon as it encounters the monsters, it will attack the monsters immediately. By consuming a certain amount of ammunition, a certain amount of the life value of the monsters is reduced. And then, the monsters attack the robot and destroy a certain number of robot's parts. Then they attack each other alternately like this. However, each time the robot launches attack firstly. If there are two or more monsters, the robot must kill the first one before another attack, and the monsters won't help each other in the battle.<P>The choice of the order of attack is decisive when a number of monsters are in a room, because it closely relates with the final result of this battle. The robot itself and machine guns it takes possess the capacity of restoration. The robot will re-load 2 bullets when it launches an attack. In the same room, the robot will repair 10 damaged parts of the body surface and re-filled cartridges after it kills a monster. The robot can't leave the room until all monsters are eradicated. At the time he leaves the room, 100 damaged parts are repaired and 100 cartridges are refilled again. It should be noted that, under no circumstances will the robot's parts and bullets of cartridges be more than 100.<P>Now intelligent underwater robot has been put into the sea, gradually approaching the location of the treasure vessel. Whether it can eradicate deep-sea monsters, and return the treasure box is the problem that you are supposed to resolve.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>There are several test cases.

The yacht is equipped with the most advanced navigation and driving system which can all be manipulated by a computer. When the captain notices that there is only gentle breeze and the sea waves are not high, he starts the autopilot. The yacht sails forward smoothly, ploughs the waves. When itâs completely dark, the passengers start to feel a little funny for sudden forward rushes or sudden decelerations or slight swings. The captain immediately walks to the driving platform and switches the autopilot to human manipulation. The yacht returns back to normal and the party restarts. Laughers come back, too. 

<P>
The captain summons the engineer on board to do a thorough check of the navigation system. It turns out that only the computer is out of order, but the exact failure is still unclear. There is a computer scientist among the passengers who is also invited to the cab to give a hand. He first inputs several groups of data to test the computer. When he inputs 1+2+3, the computer outputs 6, which is exactly right. But when he inputs 4+5+6, the computer outputs 5, which is wrong. Then he inputs 12+13+14, and gets 39, another right answer, while he inputs 14+15+16, and gets 35, another wrong answer. After the test, the computer scientist says smilingly: ``the failure is clear now. The computer's adder can not carry." After excluding the failure, the captain restarts the autopilot and the yacht returns back to normal, sailing smoothly on the sea. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The captain and the engineer invite the computer scientist to sit down and have a talk. The computer scientist tells a story as following: 

<P>
A former mathematician defined a kind of simple addition expression. 

<P>
If there is an expression <!-- MATH
 $(i) + (i+1) + (i+2)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>i</I>) + (<I>i</I> + 1) + (<I>i</I> + 2)</SPAN>

 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/4317img1.png
 ALT="$ \ge$"> 0</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, when carried out additive operations, no position 
has a carry, it is called simple addition expression. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
For instance, when <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> equals 0, 0+1+2 is a simple addition expression, meanwhile when <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> equals 11, 11+12+13 is a simple addition expression, too. Because of that no position has a carry. 

<P>
However, when <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> equals 3, 3+4+5 is not a simple addition expression, that is because 3+4+5 equals 12, 
there is a carried number from unit digit to tens digit. In the same way, when <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> equals 13, 13+14+15 
is not a simple addition expression, either. However, when <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> equals 112, 112+113+114 is a simple 
addition expression. Because 112+113+114 equals 339, there is no carry in the process of adding. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
When the students have got the definition of simple addition expression, the mathematician puts forward a new question: for a positive integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, how many simple addition expressions exist when <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> &lt; <I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. In addition, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the first number of a simple addition expression. 

<P>
When the value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is large enough, the problem needs to be solved by means of computer.

In times of peace, various countries have held regular maneuvers to maintain military's vigilance. There is a navy fleet in a certain country which also starts a new round imaginary naval battle. 

<P>
At the maneuver stage, the admiral intends to assess the combat effectiveness of two warships, ``Victory" and ``Glory", so he lets two warships carry out countering exercises. Both of the warship commanders are young and promising, who graduated from naval academy as outstanding students. Not only have they had rich navigation direction experiences, but also have profound scientific knowledge, especially in mathematics. 

<P>
The admiral appoints one marine area dotted with many islets. Suppose all these islets are occupied by the enemy, and there are positive integers of enemy firebases. The hypothetical exercise situations given by the admiral and the rule of the competition are as follows: 

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(1)</DT>
<DD>All the occupied islets are connected. There are some routes among these islets, but the route from one islet to another islet is unidirectional. In other words, if we take an islet as a node and an islet route as an edge, then we will get a directed non-cyclic connected graph. 
</DD>
<DT>(2)</DT>
<DD>There is a unique 1st islet in the graph. If we start from this islet, we can reach any other islet. (maybe the 1st islet is not the islet which is numbered 1) 
</DD>
<DT>(3)</DT>
<DD>At the beginning of the maneuver, two warships simultaneously sail to the 1st islets and eliminate all enemy firebases together. 
</DD>
<DT>(4)</DT>
<DD>The two warships, ``Victory" and ``Glory" take turns to navigate and exchange as soon as they arrive at an islet, then they move forward together. But each time they can only go along the unidirectional route, sail to the islet directly connected to the current, and eliminates all the enemy firebases on the islet. By the way, when start from 1st islet, ``Victory" first navigates. 
</DD>
<DT>(5)</DT>
<DD>Because each route is unidirectional, and graph is non-cycle, therefore the maneuver terminates when the two warships fail to go on navigating. 
</DD>
<DT>(6)</DT>
<DD>When the maneuver ends, sum the numbers of eliminated enemy firebases on the routing path. If the number is greater than or equal to certain number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>f</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> assigned by the admiral, then ``Victory" wins. Otherwise, ``Glory" wins. 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The warship commanders are both mathematicians. After being assigned to such task, they see it is a Graph Theory problem. On the first simple directed non-cyclic connected graph, each node has a certain positive integer,it indicates the enemy firebases. The assignment is that two captains take turn to move forward along the directed edge until they are unable to do so. Then sum the total positive integers of the nodes on the routing path. Compare the number with the certain number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>f</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and decides the final winning or losses. Therefore, when it is the time for their own navigation, they are supposed to choose the route to win the final success.

<P>During the process of the military exercise, there is a ship on the sea level .The ship will go to certain place to carry out a task. For every action, the ship has two ways to sail. They are normal sailing and accelerated sailing. The normal speed of the ship is certain, when the ship sails normally, it can only move 1 step to the adjacent normal sea level. The ship can also accelerate. There are 2 kinds of accelerated sailings, one is moving forward <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> steps <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>d</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/4319img1.png ALT="$ \le$">5)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> in a straight line, and it must move forward <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> steps <SPAN CLASS="textbf">exactly</SPAN> every time it accelerates, The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> steps must be on the normal sea level, otherwise, it can not accelerate. The other is accelerating while getting through the undercurrent. There are a lot of undercurrents on the sea, and entering the undercurrent area needs to accelerate when the ship is 1 step to the undercurrent. However, the ship itself will be damaged more or less by the undercurrent, After entering the undercurrent, the speed of the ship will become normal immediately. Every time it accelerates, the ship has to consume a certain B energy, and when it starts up ,it carries certain B energy.<P>While the ship is sailing on the sea, it needs to consume a certain A energy. One unit of distance will consume one unit of A energy, and when the ship starts up, it carries enough A energy.<P>There are many reefs on the sea, and the ship can not get through.<P>Now the ship is required to sail to the certain place, of course, to minimize the damage to the ship itself is a priority because the cost of ships is very expensive. The damage is, of course, the smaller, the better. At the same time, an attempt should be made to control the consumption of A energy to the smallest amount during the whole process because the cost of A energy is much more expensive than that of B energy, and you can use B energy which the ship carried when it started up as you wish.<P>Now the question is to work out the minimal times of action from the departure point to the destination under the condition that to minimize the damage to the ship is a priority and then the consumption of A energy to the smallest degree.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="466" HEIGHT="476" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/4319img1.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4319.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input file contains several test cases, the first line contains an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, indicates the number of test cases.

Wang Haiyang is a strong and optimistic Chinese youngster. Although born and brought up in the northern inland city Harbin, he has deep love and yearns for the boundless oceans. After graduation, he came to a coastal city and got a job in a marine transportation company. There, he held a position as a navigator in a freighter and began his new life. 

<P>
The cargo vessel, Wang Haiyang worked on, sails among 6 ports between which exist 9 routes. At the first sight of his navigation chart, the 6 ports and 9 routes on it reminded him of Graph Theory that he studied in class at university. In the way that Leonhard Euler solved The Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg, Wang Haiyang regarded the navigation chart as a graph of Graph Theory. He considered the 6 ports as 6 nodes and 9 routes as 9 edges of the graph. The graph is illustrated as below.

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>
</DIV>

<P>
According to Graph Theory, the number of edges related to a node is defined as Degree number of this node. 

<P>
Wang Haiyang looked at the graph and thought, ``If arranged, the Degree numbers of all nodes of graph G can form such a sequence: 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, which is called the degree sequence of the graph. Of course, the degree sequence of any simple graph (according to Graph Theory, a graph without any parallel edge or ring is a simple graph) is a non-negative integer sequence" 

<P>
Wang Haiyang is a thoughtful person and tends to think deeply over any scientific problem that grabs his interest. So as usual, he also gave this problem further thought, ``as we know, any a simple graph always corresponds with a non-negative integer sequence. But whether a non-negative integer sequence always corresponds with the degree sequence of a simple graph? That is, if given a non-negative integer sequence, are we sure that we can draw a simple graph according to it." 

<P>
Let's put forward such a definition: provided that a non-negative integer sequence is the degree sequence of a graph without any parallel edge or ring, that is, a simple graph, the sequence is draw-possible, otherwise, non-draw-possible. Now the problem faced with Wang Haiyang is how to test whether a non-negative integer sequence is draw-possible or not. Since Wang Haiyang hasn't studied Algorithm Design course, it is difficult for him to solve such a problem. Can you help him?

<P>When a vessel sails on the vast and boundless sea, the captain must know his position in any time. There is a technique called triangle-navigation can solves this problem.<P>Suppose there are three islands in some sea area. They form a large triangle.

<P>Gabiluso is one of the greatest spies in his country. Now he's trying to complete an ``impossible" mission --- to make it slow for the army of City Colugu to reach the airport. City Colugu has <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> bus stations and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> roads.

<P>Sheryl works for a software company in the country of Brada. Her job is to develop a Windows operating system. People in Brada are incredibly conservative. They even never use graphical monitors! So Sheryl's operating system has to run in text mode and windows in that system are formed by characters. Sheryl decides that every window has an ID which is a capital English letter (`A' to `Z'). Because every window had a unique ID, there can't be more than 26 windows at the same time. And as you know, all windows are rectangular.<P>On the screen of that ugly Windows system, a window's frame is formed by its ID letters. Fig-1 shows that there is only one window on the screen, and that window's ID is `A'. Windows may overlap. Fig-2 shows the situation that window B is on the top of window A. And Fig-3 gives a more complicated overlapping. Of course, if some parts of a window are covered by other windows, you can't see those parts on the screen.<P><P><BR><PRE>

<P>
Professor Jonathan is a well-known Canadian physicist and meteorologist. People who know him well call him ``Wind Chaser". It is not only because of his outstanding tornado research which is the most influential in the academic community, but also because of his courageous act in collecting real data of tornados. Actually he has been leading his team chasing tornado by cars equipped with advanced instruments hundreds of times. 

<P>
In summer, tornado often occurs in the place where Professor Jonathan lives. After several years of research, Wind Chaser found many formation rules and moving patterns of tornados. In the satellite image, a tornado is a circle with radius of several meters to several kilometers. And its center moves between two locations in a straight line, back and forth at a fixed speed. After observing a tornado's movement, Wind Chaser will pick a highway, which is also a straight line, and chase the tornado along the highway at the maximum speed of his car. 

<P>
The smallest distance between the Wind Chaser and the center of the tornado during the whole wind chasing process, is called ``observation distance". Observation distance is critical for the research activity. If it is too short, Wind Chaser may get killed; and if it is too far, Wind Chaser can't observe the tornado well. After many times of risk on lives and upset miss, Wind Chaser turns to you, one of his most brilliant students, for help. The only thing he wants to know is the forthcoming wind chasing will be dangerous, successful or just a miss.

<P>Panagola, The Lord of city F likes to parade very much. He always inspects his city in his car and enjoys the welcome of his citizens. City F has a regular road system. It looks like a matrix with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> + 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> west-east roads and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I> + 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> north-south roads. Of course, there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>n</I> + 1)&#215;(<I>m</I> + 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> road crosses in that system. The parade can start at any cross in the southernmost road and end at any cross in the northernmost road. Panagola will never travel from north to south or pass a cross more than once. Citizens will see Panagola along the sides of every west-east road. People who love Panagola will give him a warm welcome and those who hate him will throw eggs and tomatoes instead. We call a road segment connecting two adjacent crosses in a west-east road a ``love-hate zone". Obviously there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> love-hate zones in every west-east road. When passing a love-hate zone, Panagola may get happier or less happy, depending on how many people love him or hate him in that zone. So we can give every love-hate zone a ``welcome value" which may be negative, zero or positive. As his secretary, you must make Panagola as happy as possible. So you have to find out the best route --- of which the sum of the welcome values is maximal. You decide where to start the parade and where to end it.<P>When seeing his Citizens, Panagola always waves his hands. He may get tired and need a break. So please never make Panagola travel in a same west-east road for more than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> minutes. If it takes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> minutes to pass a love-hate zone, we say the length of that love-hate zone is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

For some reason, the contestants can't choose a referee whose skill rank is higher or lower than both of theirs. The contestants have to walk to the referee's house, and because they are lazy, they want to make their total walking distance no more than the distance between their houses.

Recently, some archaeologists discovered an ancient relic on a small island in the Pacific Ocean. In the relic, they found an interesting cone shaped container with transparent bottom. The container lay on the horizontal ground with its central axis parallel to the ground. Just beside the container, they found a manual telling them something about the container. The container was a timer for a special ceremony. Ancient people filled it all with water before the ceremony, and when the ceremony began, they pulled out the plug in the small hole on the tip of the cone to let the water out. There was a horizontal line called ``sacred line" carved on the bottom of the cone, and when the water level hit that line, they pushed the plug back and ended the ceremony. But the archaeologists could not found the sacred line on that cone. In order to sell the timer at a good prize, the archaeologists wanted to recover that very important line. By the manual they figured out how much water flew out when the ceremony ended, but they don't know what to do next, so they come to you for help. 

<P>
They measures the height of the cone, and the diameter of the bottom, you should tell them the sacred line's height above the ground.

Too worrying about the house price bubble, poor Mike sold his house and rent an apartment in a 50-floor building several months ago. This building has only one elevator because it is a so called ``rotten tail building". There are always a lot of people crowding at the gate of the elevator on every floor. Many people have to climb hundreds of steps in order to save time. 

<P>
After months of climbing, Mike feels that he can't stand it any more. He wants to sue the building owner. In order to let the judge understand how terrible the situation is, he decides to write a program to simulate the running of the elevator in a day. You'd better let him copy one from you. 

<P>
At first, the elevator is at the status of ``idle". If the three conditions below are all satisfied at the same time, we say the elevator is at ``idle" status: 

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1)</DT>
<DD>The elevator is stopped. 
</DD>
<DT>2)</DT>
<DD>Nobody outside is waiting for the elevator. 
</DD>
<DT>3)</DT>
<DD>There is nobody in the elevator or all people in the elevator are just on their destination floor. 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
There are an up button and a down button at the elevator gate on every floor except that only up button on the first floor, and only down button on the 50th floor. When someone wants to take the elevator, he pushes a button according to the direction he wants to go, and then wait. If the elevator is not moving towards his destination floor, he will not get in even the elevator comes and opens its door. When someone pushes a button, we say that he send a request to the elevator. 

<P>
When the elevator is idle and then some requests are sent to it, it will move towards the direction from which the first request is sent. If more than one request is sent at the same time, the requests sent form the same floor where the elevator stays have higher priority. In other cases, requests which will make the elevator go up, have higher priority than the same time requests which will make the elevator go down. 

<P>
Once the elevator starts moving, it keeps its moving direction until the three conditions below are all satisfied at the same time: 

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1)</DT>
<DD>All the people in the elevator have reached their destination floor. 
</DD>
<DT>2)</DT>
<DD>There is nobody waiting for the elevator at the elevator's moving direction. 
</DD>
<DT>3)</DT>
<DD>Nobody on the floor where the elevator stays wants to go towards the elevator's moving direction. 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
When the three conditions above are all satisfied at the same time, if there are requests from the direction opposite to the elevator's last moving direction, the elevator will turn around and start moving; and if there are no requests at that time, the elevator will stay there and become idle. 

<P>
When the elevator reaches a certain floor, it will stop and open its door when one of the two conditions below is satisfied: 

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1)</DT>
<DD>Someone inside the elevator wants to get off on that floor. 
</DD>
<DT>2)</DT>
<DD>Someone on that floor wants to go towards the elevator's moving direction. 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
It takes one second for the elevator to move from one floor to another. 

<P>
It takes one second for the elevator to open the door or close the door. 

<P>
It takes one second for people outside the elevator to get in, no mater how many people. 

<P>
It takes one second for people inside the elevator go get out, no mater how many people. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The elevator can't stop between two floors.

<p>Wango is a brilliant maths teacher. He has two sons Kango and Dango. They are born two years apart on the same day! Kango is 9 and Dango is 7. Their birthdays are approaching again. Wango has to buy them a gift each. After long thought, this time Wango wanted to give each of his sons a piece of the Pango board and thus introduce them to higher mathematics.</p><p>A size n (n >= 0) Pango board is a 2 by n rectangle of unit squares. A pango board has to be tiled with Pango pieces. Any tiling with the Pango pieces is acceptable. A size 0 Pango board exists and is unique and serves as an example of the empty set.</p><p>Four types of Pango pieces are available.</p><pre>

</pre><p>Picture of the four kinds of pieces</p><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/p4332.jpg /><p>When Wango presents a board to Kango or Dango, he has to tile the board completely with these pieces (unlimited number of pieces of each type are available) and then give them out. Note that pieces cannot be rotated for tiling. To cut costs (recession mind you), Wango decides to buy a single board of size N, then choose a k (0 <= k <= N), and give a size k board to Kango and a size (N-k) board to Dango, (tiled of course). Help him find the number of ways he can give the presents. Two ways are distinct if and only if either Dango gets a different board or Kango gets a different board. Two Pango boards are considered the same if and only if they have the same tiling (same set of tiles at the same places) from left to right (rotation of board is not allowed in comparing). </p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a sequence of cases, one per line.<br/>
Each case consists of one integer N (0 <= N <= 1000,000,000) representing the size of the board which Wango is going to buy.<br/>
The input will end with a line containing -1. This case should not be processed.
<br/>There will be a maximum of 300 test cases. </p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>One line per case, outputting the number of ways Wango can distribute the presents to his sons modulo 10,007. </p>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

Number of different 0-sized Pango boards = 1<br />

Number of different 1-sized Pango boards = 2<br />

Number of different 2-sized Pango boards = 6<br />

For N = 0, he has to give 0-sized boards to both his sons. He can do this in 1*1 = 1 way<br />

For N = 1, he has to give 0-sized board to one of his sons, and 1-sized board to the other, for a total of 2*1 + 1*2 = 4 ways<br />

For N = 2, he can give the presents in 6*1 + 2*2 + 1*6 = 16 ways<br />

<p>2M scientists are supposed to present papers in a conference in a day. The day is divided into 2 slots, the morning slot and the evening slot. M scientists present their paper in the morning slot and the remaining in the evening slot. Both slots are separated by a lunch break.</p><p>Some scientists depend on a paper from some other scientists to be presented before theirs. So if Scientist A is presenting a paper on "Graph Theory" and Scientist B on "Max flow-Min cut", then A has to present before B. Lunch break is a time of merry making and partying, so attendees tend to forget the papers in the previous half. Due to this, the dependent scientist (B in this case) has to present the paper in the same slot as the scientist on whom he is dependent (A in this case). Given the dependencies, find the number of possible orderings of presenting the papers.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input will contain an integer T <= 20 denoting the number of test cases.<br />
Each test case will be formatted as follows:-<br />
The first line will contain an integer denoting 1<= M <= 8.<br />
The next 2M lines will contain 2M characters each. Each character will either be 'Y' or 'N'. If the i th line's j th character is 'Y' it means that scientist i is dependent on scientist j. 'N' signifies no dependence. A scientist will never be dependent on himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Goldust (1817-1890) was one of the first gold prospectors in the California Gold Rush. He literally struck gold there and became the owner of a few hundred gold pits. Mr. Goldust's great great great grandson Mr. Stardust currently owns the gold pits. Most of the gold has been dug up already, so Mr. Stardust wants to finish digging and get going to Las Vegas. A corporate giant offered to help him by supplying machines. </p>
<p>The machines are worth their weight in gold, so Mr. Stardust can only buy exactly one such machine. This machine was built using advanced science and thus does not work unless given appropriate working conditions.</p>
<p>Each day, Mr. Stardust will assign the machine to exactly one of the gold pits. If he assigns it to pit 'i', two things can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The machine will break down - with probability bi (0 < bi <= 1) . The machine cannot be used any more</li>
<li>The machine will extract gold - with probability (1-bi) the machine will extract a proportion ri (0 <= ri <= 1) of the gold remaining in pit i</li>
</ul>
<p>
Theoretically the machine can last forever or break down very soon. So, Mr. Stardust's plan is to wait suitably long and then take off to Las Vegas. Of course, he will end up broke if the machine breaks down on day 1. He first needs to know how much gold he can expect to get using the machine optimally, that is, the best expected value of gold Mr. Stardust can achieve with an optimal strategy of allocating the machine to the pits.
</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a sequence of cases.<br/>
Each case starts with N (0 < N <= 100) on a line, representing the number of gold pits. Following this line are N lines, each one describing one pit. The ith line has three integers xi, yi and gi where bi = xi/100 , ri = yi/100 and gi is the amount of gold in pit i. ( 1 <= xi <= 100 , 0 <= yi <= 100 , 1 <= gi <= 100).
<br/>The last case will be followed by a -1. This case should not be processed.
<br/>There will be a maximum of 50 test cases. </p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one case per line, the best expected value of gold that can be obtained, rounded to six decimal places.</p>

<h2>Explanation </h2>
<p>
In the first and second sample cases, keep assigning the machine to the only pit available. In the third sample case, clearly it is better to assign the machine to pit 1 on day 1 and if it survives, assign it to pit 2 from day 2 onwards.

If the player clicks on a square without a mine, a digit is revealed in that square, the digit indicating the number of adjacent squares that contain mines. Two squares are adjacent if they share an edge or a corner, i. e. a square can have at most 8 adjacent squares. By using logic, players can in many instances use this information to deduce that certain other squares are mine-free (or mine-filled), and proceed to click on additional squares to clear them or mark them with flag graphics to indicate the presence of a mine.</p><p><img alt="minesweeper.png" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/p4335.png width="170" height="170"></p><p>Clark Kent is a Minesweeper addict. And with help from his Kryptonian (a planet far far away from earth) powers he solves them at lightning speed and gives them to you. Your job is to tell him whether the solved version is correct or not. A board is correctly solved iff all flagged squares <strong>should</strong> contain a mine and every square containing a number <strong>X</strong> has exactly <strong>X</strong> adjacent squares flagged.</p><h3>Input</h3><p>The first line of input will contain an integer T <= 20 denoting the number of test cases.<br/>
Each test case will be formatted as follows:-<br/>
<ul>
<li>
The first line will contain two integers separated by a single space denoting 1<=<strong>n</strong><=20 and 1 <= <strong>m</strong><=20 respectively.<br/>
</li>
<li>
The next <strong>n</strong> lines will contain <strong>m</strong>
characters each. Each character will either be a digit (0 to 8
inclusive) or 'F'. The presence of 'F' indicates that Clark has flagged
the square. The digits indicate the number of mines in the adjacent
squares.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output one line per case:-<br/>
<ul>
<li>
'Well done Clark!' if the board was solved successfully.
</li>
<li>
'Please sweep the mine again!' otherwise.<br/>

<p>Sita and Gita are smart kids. Generally after completing their homework
they go out for some outdoor games. But it's raining today and they
have to stay home. They decide to break their piggy-bank and count
their savings. They find out that they have accumulated many coins over
the last few months and decide to play a game with these coins. First
they divide the coins into 2 piles containing <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> coins respectively.</p>
<p>
<img alt="" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/p4337.gif width="148" height="155">
</p><p>
Now they start the game by alternating turns. In each turn a player can do one of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li> Remove any number of coins from a single pile.</li>
<li> Remove equal number of coins from both piles.</li>
<li> Pass on the turn to the next player. Note that this still counts as a turn.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The game ends when no move is possible and the player who
cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally. Being smart,
both players calculate the outcome of the game before the game begins.
The player who loses tries to maximize the number of turns in the game
and player who wins tries to minimize the turns. No player can pass
more than <strong>P</strong> times. Sita starts the game.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The first line of input will contain an interger T <= 200 denoting the number of test cases.<br/>
Each test case will contain a single line formatted as follows:-

<p>Dice Poker is a version of Poker that is played using Dice. Two or more people can play this game. The detailed rules of the 2 player version of the game are mentioned in the section: Rules of the Game.</p><p>Two players A and B are playing the game of Dice Poker. Being experts in this game, both always play optimally. A always plays to maximize his chance of winning, and B tries to minimize the chance of A winning (draw is fine for B). In the first round, Player A rolls the Dice, followed by player B. You as an onlooker, look closely at the rolls and wonder what will A and B do next, and what is the probability of A winning. Haven't played this game much before, you decide to write a program to predict with what probability will A win this Game after the 2nd (final) round.</p><h4>Rules of the Game:-</h4><p>In the first round, two players start of by rolling 5 dice each, one after the other. For this problem we shall assume that all Dice are 6 sided and fair containing digits 1 to 6. Then a round of betting happens, which is irrelevant to this problem statement. In the second round the first player picks between 0 to 5 of his currently rolled dice and rolls them again. All the 5 dice are then merged (merge here simply means that all the 5 dice are taken together to form a set, including the ones rolled in the first round and are not re-rolled in the second) to form the final roll (or hand). Then the second player looks at the final hand of the first player and then similarly re-rolls between 0 to 5 dice to get her final hand. The hands are then compared and one with the higher weight wins.</p><p>In the real game, in case of a tie both the players share the pot, but since this problem specifically asks for the probability of A winning, we shall assume that a tie is considered as A not winning (hence B wins).</p><p>To determine which of the hands has higher weight, following arrangements are considered and are in descending order of weight. The first arrangement beats the second and so on.</p><h4>Arrangements:</h4><ul><li>5 of a kind: All the 5 dice show the same number. Example: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3</li> <li>4 of a kind: 4 of the dice show the same number. Example: 2, 2, 2, 2, 5</li> <li>Full house (3 of a kind + 2 of a kind): 3 of the 5 show the same number and the rest 2 show a different number. Example: 4, 4, 4, 6, 6</li> <li>Straight: All the 5 dice are in a sequence. Example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (or the other possibility is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)</li> <li>3 of a kind: 3 of the dice show the same number. Example: 6, 6, 6, 2, 4</li> <li>2 Pair: There are 2 pairs. Example: 4, 4, 1, 1, 3</li> <li>Pair: 2 of the dice show the same number. Example: 3, 3, 1, 2, 4</li> <li>Rest: Example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6</li></ul><p>The highest weight arrangement that suits the hand is considered. For example a 5 of a kind is also a 4 of a kind, but the player would naturally call it 5 of a kind. Also in a particular arrangement, the higher weight arrangement is the one with the highest value of the most significant part of the arrangement. If a the tie still remains then it is broken by the next significant part and so on. For Example, In 4 of a kind the most significant part are the 4 dice with the same number. So the arrangement 4, 4, 4, 4, 1 is better than 3, 3, 3, 3, 6. In 3 of a kind the 3 with the same number is the most significant part. However in a 2 pair, there are 2 equally significant parts, and the one with the highest number will be considered first for breaking the tie. In the 'Rest' arrangement, first compare the highest numbers of the 2 hands, then the 2nd highest and so on.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>First line contains T (T <= 20) the number of test cases to follow For each case, the first line contains 5 space separated numbers, the arrangement of the dice after the first round for player A. The second line contains 5 space separated numbers, the arrangement of the dice after the first round for player B. Each of the numbers will be between 1 and 6 inclusive. </p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case output a single number in a line, giving the probability of A winning. You will need to round it off to 6 decimal places. (0.0000005 -> 0.000001 and 0.0000004 -> 0.000000). Always output exactly 6 decimal places.</p>

<h4>Explanation of the first case</h4>
<p>A already has the best possible set (all 6's) so he won't roll again. B has no chance of winning. However she can probably force a draw by throwing all 6's. So the only option for her is to re-roll all the 5 dice. The number of possible outcomes are 6*6*6*6*6 out of which only 1 will force a draw. So the answer is 1 - (1/6^5). </p>

<h4 align="center">Time limit: 10 seconds</h4>
<hr />
<p>It's 2015. Terrorists are still largely on the prowl. Governments however have decided to be smarter. Now, they monitor each higway, airway and seaway. Across each road, they built several cameras which can capture images ahead of them.</p>
<p>More specifically, there are N uniformly spaced cameras per kilometer along a highway of length M kms, making in total M*N cameras (there is no camera at the end of the M kms). The highway is oneway and goes from North to South. The cameras have a special property: </p>
<ul>
<li>They use direct vision to watch the next N (or less if the highway ends) cameras to their South thus covering 1 km.</li>
<li>They communicate via satellite with all the cameras beyond the next N southern cameras thus knowing their video feed. </li>
<li>They do not communicate with the next N southern cameras and only depend on their vision.</li>
</ul>
<p>A camera being destroyed by a terrorist will be caught by cameras to its north. Corrupt politicians have sold this secret to the terrorists and they know that they can't destroy a camera unless they are sure that this camera is no longer communicating or being watched by a camera to its North. There is one further complication: Corrupt technicians have not properly installed the direct vision equipment. Thus, some of the cameras are substandard and deficient. These cameras have perfectly good communication with far off cameras (i.e. after the first N cameras), but cannot see some of the next N cameras. However, the saving grace was that there were no more than 10 deficient cameras in any 1 km stretch (among any contiguous N cameras).</p>
<p>As Anti Corruption Task force, you, a non corrupt patriot have to submit a security report. For that, you need to solve the following problem: If <b>exactly two</b> terrorists decide to destroy all the cameras on the highway without being caught, how long would it take them? Each terrorist can destroy one camera in one FULL minute. They can work simultaneously. Of course, they cannot destroy two cameras A and B at the same time if A can watch B or B can watch A.</p>
<p>The cameras are numbered 1 to M*N North to South.</p>
<p>Note that Ci cannot watch or get the video feed of Cj if i > j where Ci is the camera numbered i. </p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input will be a sequence of cases. Each case starts with M and N on a single line (1 <= M <= 15 ,1 <= N <= 20). M*N - 1 lines follow. The Cth line describes camera number C. It starts with a number k. If k = -1 camera C is not deficient and there are no more numbers on this line. Otherwise, k numbers, aj (1<=j<=k) (C+1 <= aj <= C+N and aj <=M*N) follow on the same line meaning that camera C can watch camera aj. Note that camera C can always watch cameras C + N + 1 and later using satellite and will not be mentioned here. </p>
<p>The last case will be followed by a line containing two zeroes. </p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line per case, the minimum number of minutes required by two terrorists working in tandem to destroy all the cameras without being caught. </p>

<P>
An IT company decided to publish an internal newsletter describing the projects that have been successfully completed. Each department submits a text paragraph that will be printed in a corresponding designated box of the newsletter. Let's assume that the paragraph contains only characters <!-- MATH
 $a \ldots z$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I>...<I>z</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and spaces (ASCII code is 32) in several lines, and a word is defined to be the longest sequence of non-space characters on a line. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The printing has to satisfy the following rules: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Text will be printed in a fixed-width font (meaning that every character occupies a fixed size width) from left to right and going down to the next line at the end of every line. 
</LI>
<LI>The number of printed characters in every line must be the same. 
</LI>
<LI>Words are printed in the box in the same order as they appear in the given paragraph. A word cannot be split or printed on more than one line. 
</LI>
<LI>Consecutive words on the same line are separated by exactly one space. 
</LI>
<LI>Every line contains only words from the original paragraph and spaces. 
</LI>
<LI>Any line that starts with a space must contain only spaces.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The newsletter editor wants to formally assess the prettiness level of a paragraph printing by defining the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">unbalance</SPAN> of it as the sum of the cubes of the number of space characters at the end of each line including lines containing only spaces. The smaller the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">unbalance</SPAN>, the prettier the paragraph printing is. 

<P>
Consider the following example where the paragraph is printed in a box with three lines and each line has a 20-characters width in two ways: 

<P>

<IMG

 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/4345img1.png
 ALT="$\textstyle \parbox{.5\textwidth}{
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{\vert l\vert}
...
...tt{eeeeeee ffffff} \\
\texttt{ggggggggg} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{center}}$"><IMG
 WIDTH="277" HEIGHT="123" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/4345img1.png
 ALT="$\textstyle \parbox{.49\textwidth}{
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{\vert l\vert}...
...dd eeeeeee} \\
\texttt{ffffff ggggggggg} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{center}}$">
<P>
In this example, the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">unbalance</SPAN> of the paragraph printing on the left is <!-- MATH
 $0^{3} + 6^{3} + 11^{3} = 1547$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">0<SUP>3</SUP> +6<SUP>3</SUP> +11<SUP>3</SUP> = 1547</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> while the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">unbalance</SPAN> of the paragraph printing on the right is <!-- MATH
 $7^{3} + 6^{3} + 4^{3} = 623$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">7<SUP>3</SUP> +6<SUP>3</SUP> +4<SUP>3</SUP> = 623</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The paragraph printing on the right is considered prettier. 

<P>
Given a text paragraph and a box to be printed, your task is to write a program to find the prettiest printing that has the smallest unbalance.

<P>There has been a growing interest in adventure tourism lately. However, organizing adventure tours is not an easy task.

In addition to the logistic and rescue team, the organizers also assign <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> more guides to join the tour. In the first stage of the tour, the road is quite narrow passing a cliff; the group will have to go in one line. To be able to help each other, a female participant has to go next to, i.e. before or after, a male participant or a guide. Furthermore, there must be at least one participant next to a guide. Given these constraints, there are several ways the group can form a line. Let's denote B, G and M as a male participant, a female participant and a guide respectively. A line formation can be represented by a string of length <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>p</I> + <I>q</I> + <I>k</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> containing characters from the set {B, G, M}.

<P>
<BR>
The head technical person, Joey, at ACM (Association for Cyberspace Management) has just received a weird cable-like device -- supposedly invented by programmers during a competition -- for inspection. 

<P>
The device may be viewed as a straight bi-directional cable, which can be used for transmitting arbitrary number of data packages simultaneously. The speed with which each package is sent will be pre-determined by the device and furthermore may vary within a certain range; however it will remain constant throughout each package's entire transmission process. The time it takes for a single data package with speed <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> to arrive at the opposite end of the cable is thus <!-- MATH
 $\frac{L}{V}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="41" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/4355img1.png
 ALT="$ {\frac{{L}}{{V}}}$"></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the length of the cable. 

<P>
In addition, the user may sometimes send a fixed-speed ``detector" package, which is capable of reporting the number of data packages alongside itself at any time. 

<P>
Finding this device highly amusing, Joey decides to perform an experiment on the odd ``cable". He has scheduled <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> packages to be sent from the left side and another <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> to be sent from the other side of the cable; also, he has calculated the possible speed range for each data package. With this information in hand, Joey wants to estimate the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">effectiveness</SPAN> of a detector he will send. For a detector that departs at a certain time, its <SPAN  CLASS="textit">effectiveness</SPAN> can be represented as a real number in the range <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[0..1]</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, which is simply the ratio of the time during which the detector has a chance of <SPAN ID="txt52">reporting all <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> + <I>M</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> packages</SPAN> (<SPAN  CLASS="textit">explained below</SPAN>) to the total time. 

<P>
If Joey sends the detector at an arbitrary time in <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[<I>S</I>, <I>T</I>]</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> with speed <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> from the left side of the cable, what is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">average</SPAN> effectiveness he can achieve? 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Note:</SPAN> For a detector to have a chance of <SPAN ID="txt56">reporting all <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> + <I>M</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> packages</SPAN> at time <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>0</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the device must be able to schedule all data packages with such speeds so that all can share the same position with the detector at time <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>0</SUB></SPAN>

<P>The game of Tobo is played on a plastic board designed into a 3 <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&#215;</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> 3 grid with cells numbered from 1 to 9 as shown in figure (a). The grid has four dials (labeled ``A" to ``D" in the figure.) Each dial can be rotated in 90 degrees increment in either direction. Rotating a dial causes the four cells currently adjacent to it to rotate along. For example, figure (b) shows the Tobo after rotating dial ``A" once in a clockwise direction.

A seven segment display, similar to the one shown on the right, is composed of seven light-emitting elements. Individually on or off, they can be combined to produce 127 different combinations, including the ten Arabic numerals. The figure below illustrates how the ten numerals are displayed. 7-seg displays (as they're often abbreviated) are widely used in digital clocks, electronic meters, and calculators.

<P>
A 7-seg has seven connectors, one for each element, (plus few more connectors for other electrical purposes.) Each element can be turned on by sending an electric current through its pin. Each of the seven pins is viewed by programmers as a single bit in a 7-bit number, as they are more comfortable dealing with bits rather than electrical signals. The figure below shows the bit assignment for a typical 7-seg, bit 0 being the right-most bit.

<P>
For example, in order to display the digit 1, the programmer knows that only bits 1 and 3 need to be on, i.e. the 7-bit binary number to display digit 1 is ``0001010", or 10 in decimal. Let's call the decimal number for displaying a digit, its <SPAN  CLASS="textit">display code</SPAN>, or just <SPAN  CLASS="textit">code</SPAN> for short. Since a 7-seg displays 127 different configurations, display codes are normally written using 3 decimal places with leading zeros if necessary, i.e. the display code for digit 1 is written as 010. 

<P>
In a 9-digit calculator, 9 7-seg displays are stacked next to each other, and are all controlled by a single controller. The controller is sent a sequence of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3<I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> digits, representing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> display codes, where <!-- MATH

<SPAN CLASS="MATH">0 &lt; <I>n</I> &lt; 10</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> &lt; 9</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the number is right justified and leading zeros are automatically displayed. For example, the display code for 13 is 010079 while for 144 it is 010106106 

<P>
Write a program that reads the display codes of two numbers, and prints the display code of their sum.

<P>In Computer Science, <SPAN CLASS="textit">pattern matching</SPAN> is the act of checking if a certain sequence conforms (matches) a given pattern. Patterns are usually specified using a language based on <SPAN CLASS="textit">regular expression</SPAN>. In this problem, we'll use a simple regular expression to express patterns on sequences of decimal digits. A pattern is a sequence of one or more decimal digits `0' ...`9', asterisks `*', and hash signs `#'. A `*' denotes a sequence of an even number of digits, whereas a `#' denotes a sequence of an odd number of digits. For example, the pattern ``129" only matches the sequence 129. The pattern ``1*3" matches all sequences beginning with 1, ending with 3, and having an even number of decimal digits between the first and last digits. As another example, the pattern ``#55" matches the sequences 155, 12355, 1234555, but none of the sequences 55, 1255, 123455.

One reason for having one-way streets is to facilitate a smoother flow of traffic through crowded areas. This is useful in city centers, especially old cities like Cairo and Damascus. Careful planning guarantees that you can get to any location starting from any point. Nevertheless, drivers must carefully plan their route in order to avoid prolonging their trip due to one-way streets. Experienced drivers know that there are multiple paths to travel between any two locations. Not only that, there might be multiple roads between the same two locations. Knowing the shortest way between any two locations is a must! This is even more important when driving vehicles that are hard to maneuver (garbage trucks, towing trucks, etc.)<P>You just started a new job at a car-towing company. The company has a number of towing trucks parked at the company's garage. A tow-truck lifts the front or back wheels of a broken car in order to pull it straight back to the company's garage.

<P>Falling Stocks. Bankrupted companies. Banks with no Cash. Seems like the best time to invest: ``<SPAN CLASS="textit">Think I'll buy me a football team!</SPAN>"<P>No seriously, I think I have the solution to at least the problem of cash in banks. Banks nowadays are all owing each other great amounts of money and no bank has enough cash to pay other banks' debts even though, on paper at least, they should have enough money to do so. Take for example the inter-bank loans shown in figure (a). The graph shows the amounts owed between four banks (A ...D). For example, A owes B 50M while, at the same time, B owes A 150M. (It is quite common for two banks to owe each other at the same time.) A total amount of 380M in cash is needed to settle all debts between the banks.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="966" HEIGHT="394" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/p4367.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4367.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>In an attempt to decrease the need for cash, and after studying the example carefully, I concluded that there's a lot of cash being transferred unnecessarily. Take a look:<P><OL><LI>C owes D the same amount as D owes A, so we can say that C owes A an amount of 30M and get D out of the picture. </LI><LI>But since A already owes C 100M, we can say that A owes C an amount of 70M. </LI><LI>Similarly, B owes A 100M only, (since A already owes B 50M.) This reduces the above graph to the one shown in figure (b) which reduces the needed cash amount to 190M (A reduction of 200M, or 53%.) </LI><LI>I can still do better. Rather than B paying A 100M and A paying 70M to C, B can pay 70M (out of A's 100M) directly to C. This reduces the graph to the one shown in figure (c). Banks can settle all their debts with only 120M in cash. A total reduction of 260M or 68%. <SPAN CLASS="textit">Amazing!</SPAN> </LI></OL><P>I have data about inter-bank debts but I can't seem to be able to process it to obtain the minimum amount of cash needed to settle all the debts.

Bill is working in a secret laboratory. He is developing missiles for
national security projects. Bill is the head of the aerodynamics department.

One surprising fact of aerodynamics is called Whitcomb area rule.
An object flying at high-subsonic speeds develops local 
supersonic airflows and the resulting shock waves create the effect called wave drag.
Wave drag does not depend on the exact form of the object, but rather
on its <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cross-sectional profile</SPAN>. 

Consider a coordinate system with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>OZ</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> axis
pointing in the direction of object's motion. Denote the area of
a section of the object by a plane <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I> = <I>z</I><SUB>0</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I>(<I>z</I><SUB>0</SUB>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>.
Cross-sectional profile of the object is a function <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> that maps <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I><SUB>0</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> to
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I>(<I>z</I><SUB>0</SUB>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. There is a perfect aerodynamic shape called Sears-Haack body. 
The closer cross-sectional profile of an object to the cross-sectional 
profile of Sears-Haack body, the less wave drag it introduces.
That is an essence of Whitcomb area rule.

Bill's department makes a lot of computer simulations to study missile's aerodynamic properties 
before it is even built. To approximate missile's cross-sectional profile one
takes samples of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I>(<I>z</I><SUB>0</SUB>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> for integer arguments <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I><SUB>0</SUB></SPAN>

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>) rectangular grid that consists of square 
cells. Each cell is either empty or blocked. All cells on the border of the maze are blocked. 
The robot starts in an empty cell. It can move south, west, north, or east to an adjacent empty cell. 
The robot is blind and has only bump sensors, so when it attempts to move it
can either succeed or bump into blocked cell and fail.

The robot has to visit all empty cells in the maze. All cells are guaranteed to be reachable.

<B>Interaction protocol</B>

The program must write to the standard output one line with robot's action and wait for
a line in the standard input with a response, then write next action and read next 
response, and so on until all empty cells in the maze had been visited. The program must exit
only when all cells have been visited. Empty cells may be visited multiple times. It is acceptable to 
move even after all cells had been visited.

Each line of the standard output represents robot's action. It is one of the following five strings:
<TT>SOUTH</TT>, <TT>WEST</TT>, <TT>NORTH</TT>, <TT>EAST</TT>, or <TT>DONE</TT>. <TT>DONE</TT> must be printed when the robot has
visited all empty cells. After printing <TT>DONE</TT> your program must exit. You must flush standard output 
after printing each action.

One famous Russian architect plans to build
a new monumental construction. It will be 
a huge clock that indicates the time from
the beginning of the universe.

The face of this clock contains hands, moving
at constant speeds. They are numbered
from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> from the fastest to the slowest one.
The fastest hand makes
one revolution per minute (60 seconds). Each next hand moves
slower than previous, the <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>i</I> + 1)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th hand makes one revolution 
when the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th hand makes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> revolutions.

The setting mechanism of this clock is
very simple. You can take a hand by the handle,
located on its end, and move it in any direction.
When you move the hand, slower hands are moving
in proportion to their usual speeds, and faster
hands are not moving. Remember that hands are huge, 
so setting this clock is a hard job.

Consider an example with three hands: a second hand,
a minute hand, and an hour hand. Their lengths are
5, 15 and 10 meters respectively. You want to set
the clock from 2:30 to 6:00 (fig.&nbsp;1). The easiest way to do it
is to rotate the minute hand <!-- MATH
 $180^{\circ}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">180<SUP><TT>o</TT></SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> clockwise,
and then move the hour hand <!-- MATH
 $90^{\circ}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">90<SUP><TT>o</TT></SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> clockwise.
The total distance you moved the handles of the hands
is approximately 62.83 meters.

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>.
However, traffic jams that occur in MegaCity turn estimation 
of minimal driving time into a complex problem that you have to solve.

Traffic jams in MegaCity affect a rectangular area that is specified
by coordinates of its bottom-left and top-right corners.
The time to travel one block in the traffic jam is specified.
All streets that are strictly inside the rectangular region are affected by the traffic 
jam. Sometimes, it is better to drive around the traffic jams to save time, 
but sometimes it is better to drive through some traffic jams as shown in the example -- 17
blocks are driven outside of traffic jams, taking 10 time units per block, and 2 blocks
in the light traffic jam with 11 time units per block.

One important problem in concurrent programming is to ensure exclusive access to 
shared resources by multiple threads. It is also known as Mutual Exclusion protocol. 
A code that needs to be protected from concurrent execution is called 
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">critical section</SPAN> (<SPAN  CLASS="textit">CS</SPAN>). In order to coordinate access to CS, application threads use
a set of shared variables to send information to each other. These shared variables 
are distinct from all the variables that are used by application code. In practice, 
mutual exclusion protocol is implemented as two methods -- <SPAN  CLASS="textit">enterCS</SPAN> and
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">exitCS</SPAN>. When application needs to execute
some code in CS, it calls enterCS, then executes CS, then calls exitCS. 

For theoretical analysis of mutual exclusion protocol one must consider running
application as a whole. Each thread of application is represented
as an infinite loop that repeatedly performs some work unrelated to CS, which is called
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">non-critical section</SPAN> (<SPAN  CLASS="textit">NCS</SPAN>), then calls enterCS, then executes CS, then calls exitCS, 
then the loop repeats. The code inside NCS and CS is not relevant; it is considered to 
perform no operations related to the protocol and does not modify shared variables used by the protocol.

We consider a system with two concurrently running threads. Threads
use a set of shared one-bit variables to implement mutual exclusion protocol. 
Each variable can store a value of zero or one that can be read or written by a single instruction. 
Shared variables are initialized to zero.
Each thread has a local pointer to the instruction (<SPAN  CLASS="textit">IP</SPAN>) that it is going to execute 
next. Execution starts from the top of the code. During each step of execution one of the 
threads is arbitrarily chosen, it executes one instruction, and then changes its IP
to the next instruction to execute. 
This infinite sequence of steps is called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">history</SPAN>.
A history is called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">legal</SPAN> if either both threads execute infinitely many steps or just one thread 
does, while the other thread, having taken a finite number of steps, stops with IP at NCS.

The table below contains several algorithms in pseudo-code that attempt to implement mutual exclusion protocol.
In this pseudo-code <SPAN  CLASS="textit">id</SPAN> is 0 for the first thread and 1 for the second. Variables
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">want</SPAN>[0], <SPAN  CLASS="textit">want</SPAN>[1], and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">turn</SPAN> are shared between threads to implement mutual 
exclusion protocol. Lines marked with ``<code>+</code>'' implement enterCS, lines marked with ``<code>-</code>''
implement exitCS. Lines NCS() and CS() are placeholders for some code that works inside non-critical and critical 
sections respectively and is not relevant for this problem.

The task is to figure out if the given algorithm satisfies three important properties:

<UL>
<LI>The algorithm satisfies <SPAN  CLASS="textit">mutual exclusion</SPAN> if in any legal history CS is not executed
concurrently by two threads (that is, there is no step where IP of both threads is at CS).
</LI>
<LI>The algorithm satisfies <SPAN  CLASS="textit">deadlock freedom</SPAN> if any legal history has infinitely many
executions of CS. 
</LI>
<LI>The algorithm satisfies <SPAN  CLASS="textit">starvation freedom</SPAN> if in any legal history
a thread that executes infinitely many steps has infinitely many executions of CS.
</LI>
</UL>

The property of mutual exclusion is trivial. 
The algorithm that simply loops forever doing nothing will satisfy it.
The sample algorithms above all satisfy mutual exclusion, but the first two fail to achieve deadlock freedom.
The algorithm 3 (originally created by Gary Peterson) satisfies all three properties.

NCS and CS appear in the code for each thread exactly once. The code may or may not represent a simple loop, but 
is guaranteed to alternate
executions of CS and NCS by one thread, that is, in every legal history two executions of CS by one thread always 
have NCS execution by the same thread in between and, vice versa, two executions of NCS by one thread
have CS execution by the same thread in between.

For each test case, write to the output a string of three letters on a line by itself. Letters represent properties 
of mutual exclusion, deadlock freedom, and starvation freedom.
Write letter Y if the corresponding property is satisfied and N otherwise.

<B>Note:</B>

Three first samples below represent algorithms 1-3 from the problem statement.

The fourth one is an algorithm (originally created by Leslie Lamport) that uses just two shared bits 
(A and B) and satisfies mutual exclusion and deadlock freedom, but is not free from starvation.

Last two are trivial algorithms. First one never executes CS nor NCS and thus guarantees mutual exclusion,
but does not have deadlock freedom, nor starvation freedom properties. Second one loops between NCS and CS, thus
fails to achieve mutual exclusion, but is free from deadlock and starvation.

Little John studies numeral systems. After learning all about fixed-base systems, he
became interested in more unusual cases. Among those cases he found
a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Fibonacci system</SPAN>, which represents all natural numbers in an unique way
using only two digits: zero and one. But unlike usual binary scale of notation,
in the Fibonacci system you are not allowed to place two <TT>1</TT>s in adjacent positions.

One can prove that if you have number <!-- MATH
 $N = \overline{a_{n}a_{n-1}\ldots a_1}_F$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = <IMG

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> in Fibonacci
system, its value is equal to <!-- MATH
 $N = a_{n} \cdot F_{n} + a_{n-1} \cdot F_{n-1} + \ldots + a_{1} \cdot F_{1}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = <I>a</I><SUB>n</SUB><SUP> . </SUP><I>F</I><SUB>n</SUB> + <I>a</I><SUB>n-1</SUB><SUP> . </SUP><I>F</I><SUB>n-1</SUB> +...+ <I>a</I><SUB>1</SUB><SUP> . </SUP><I>F</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>,
where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>F</I><SUB>k</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is a usual Fibonacci sequence defined by <!-- MATH

You are working in Advanced Computer Monitors (ACM), Inc. The company is building and selling
giant computer screens that are composed from multiple smaller screens. Your are responsible for
design of the screens for your customers. 

Customers order screens of the specified horizontal 
and vertical resolution in pixels and a specified horizontal and vertical size in millimeters. 
Your task is to design a screen that has a required resolution in each dimension or more, and has
required size in each dimension or more, with a minimal possible price. The giant screen is always 
built as a grid of monitors of the same type. The total resolution, size, and price of the resulting
screen is simply the sum of resolutions, sizes, and prices of the screens it is built from.

You have a choice of regular monitor types that you can order and you know their resolutions, sizes, and prices.
The screens of each type can be mounted both vertically and horizontally, but the whole giant 
screen must be composed of the screens of the same type in the same orientation. You can use as many
screens of the chosen type as you need.

banks still continue to operate. Financial markets had remained closed throughout
the crisis and now regulators are gradually opening them. To prevent speculation 
and to gradually ramp up trading they will initially allow trading in only one financial 
instrument and the volume of trading will be limited to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> contracts for 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th minute of market operation.

Two banks had decided to cooperate with the government to kick-start the market operation. 
The boards of directors had agreed on trading volume for each minute of this first trading session.
One bank will be buying <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>

the outside observer will only see the volume <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> of contracts traded per minute.
However, they do not want to take any extra risk and want to have no position 
in the contract by the end of the trading session. Thus, if we define <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I><SUB>i</SUB> = 1</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> when the first
bank is buying and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I><SUB>i</SUB> = - 1</SPAN>

You are developing a new fashionable language that is not quite unlike C, C++, and Java. 
Since your language should become an object of art and fashion, you call it <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I><SUP>#</SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (spelled i-sharp).
This name combines all the modern naming trends and also hints at how smart you are.

Your language caters for a wide auditory of programmers and its type system includes
arrays (denoted with ``<TT>[]</TT>''), references (denoted with ``<TT>&amp;</TT>''), and pointers
(denoted with ``<TT>*</TT>''). Those type constructors can be freely combined in any order, 
so that a pointer to an array of references of references of integers 
(denoted with ``<TT>int&amp;&amp;[]*</TT>'') is a valid type.

Multiple variables in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I><SUP>#</SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> can be declared on a single line with a very convenient 
syntax where common type of variables is given first, followed by a list of variables, 
each optionally followed by additional variable-specific type constructors. For example, 
the following line:

<P>
<BR>

<TT>int&amp; a*[]&amp;, b, c*;</TT>

<P>
<BR>
declares variables <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> with types ``<TT>int&amp;&amp;[]*</TT>'', ``<TT>int&amp;</TT>'', and 
``<TT>int&amp;*</TT>'' correspondingly. Note, that type constructors on the right-hand sides of variables in 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I><SUP>#</SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> bind to variable and their order is reversed when they are moved to the left-hand side next to type. 
Thus ``<TT>int*&amp; a</TT>'' is equivalent to ``<TT>int a&amp;*</TT>''.

However, you discover that coding style with multiple variable declarations per line is confusing and 
is outlawed in many corporate coding standards. You decide to get rid of it and refactor 
all existing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I><SUP>#</SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> code to a single variable declaration per line and always specify type
constructor next to the type it refers to (instead of the right-hand side of variable). Your
task it to write such refactoring tool.

Each variable descriptor contains variable name, followed by zero, 
one, or more type constructors.

Type name and variable names are distinct and consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters from
``<TT>a</TT>'' to ``<TT>z</TT>'' or ``<TT>A</TT>'' to ``<TT>Z</TT>''.

Javanese is the language of the people in the Central and Eastern parts of
the island of Java, Indonesia.

In 1926, a standard orthography using the English Alphabet was created for the
Javanese language. This writing system uses all letters from A to Z.
The five letters A, E, I, O, and U are vowels, while all other
letters are consonants. In Javanese words vowels and consonants always
alternate. This property is quite useful when deciphering encrypted Javanese
texts.

A text <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> consists of words, each word contains only capital letters.
Let's call text <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> <SPAN  CLASS="textit">legitimate</SPAN> if in each word of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> vowels and
consonants alternate (no two vowels and no two consonants are located next to
each other).

A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">simple substitution cipher</SPAN> is applied to a text <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>

When introducing new terms consisting of several words, it is useful to use
abbreviations. An <SPAN  CLASS="textit">abbreviation</SPAN> is a word that consists of
the first letters of several consecutive words.

An abbreviation is called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">unambiguous</SPAN> if the following two conditions
are satisfied:

<UL>
<LI>It corresponds to exactly one sequence of words in a given text
(although this sequence can appear in the text more than once);
</LI>
<LI>It does not appear in the text by itself.
</LI>
</UL>

For example, in the text
``<TT>A recursive acronym KINA means "KINA is not abbreviation"</TT>'',
strings ``<TT>ARA</TT>'' and ``<TT>K</TT>'' are unambiguous abbreviations,
strings ``<TT>A</TT>'' and ``<TT>KINA</TT>'' are ambiguous abbreviations,
and strings ``<TT>RAA</TT>'' and ``<TT>KNA</TT>'' are not abbreviations.

To introduce an abbreviation in a text, it is placed in parentheses
right after the sequence of words it corresponds to. Future occurrences
of this sequence of words can be replaced by the abbreviation.
In the example text above, introduction of the abbreviation ``<TT>K</TT>'' produces the
following text:
``<TT>A recursive acronym KINA (K) means "K is not abbreviation"</TT>''.

If two occurrences of a sequence of words overlap,
only one of them can be replaced by the abbreviation.
Words in a sequence are separated by one or more non-alphabetic characters. 
Comparison of words is case-insensitive.
For example, ``<TT>i18n</TT>'' is an occurrence of the word sequence ``<TT>I n</TT>''.

The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">effectiveness</SPAN> of an abbreviation is the decrease in
the number of letters after introduction of this abbreviation.
Only letters are taken into account;
spaces, parentheses and all other non-alphabetical characters do not count.

Given a text, find an unambiguous abbreviation with the maximum effectiveness.

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

Otherwise, the first line of the output  should contain the effectiveness

Moreover, they require that all the paper (which may not be cheap, but is definitely not that expensive!) has to be used, i.e. no tiny bit may be left over.

<P>There is this big museum, full of fancy rooms and shiny corridors. It is so large that planning any tour in it becomes a serious issue. This is where your help is necessary. You are to help in planning signs that will make navigation through the whole building much easier. The idea is that if a room has d doors leading through corridors to other rooms, these doors and corresponding corridors are (locally) labeled with numbers <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1, 2,..., <I>d</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Then all visitors are advised to follow a simple procedure. If they are in room <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> at the very beginning of their tour, they should choose door labelled with 1 and pass through the corresponding corridor If they are in room <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and they entered it through door labelled with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, they should pick the door labelled with the next number (i.e. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> + 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> &lt; <I>d</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and 1 if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> = <I>d</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) and pass through corresponding corridor. Here is a simple example, in which tourists start in room 1 and visit rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in this order passing through each corridor at least once:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="447" HEIGHT="372" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/43/p4385.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4385.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>Exhibits in this museum are not only in rooms but also in corridors connecting different rooms. After all, the corridors are well suited for displaying paintings and photography! Thus we want to ensure that the tourists that follow the rules will pass through each corridor at least once, assuming they do not get bored easily and walk long enough, <SPAN CLASS="textbf">irrespectively of the room they started the tour in</SPAN>. Your task is to find such a labelling.<P>It turns out that there are at most 3 corridors outgoing from each room and the whole museum is connected, i.e. it is possible to walk between any two rooms, possibly passing through other rooms along the way.

<P>Morphic is a tree that grows very rapidly, bringing happiness to its owner. It has a single trunk consisting of a number of cells stacked one on top of another. Each cell has one of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> possible colors which determine the way it mutates during the night, while nobody can see it. Florists denote these colors by the first <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> small letters of the English alphabet and know exactly into how many cells, and of what colors, a cell of each color divides. In fact, they have wrote their knowledge down simply with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> nonempty words, each word representing the resulting sequence of colors.<P>A seed of a Morphic has a single cell of color <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and is rooted firmly in the ground. As long as the Morphic is still alive, each night all its cells simultaniously morph according to the aforementioned rules, possibly causing an exponential growth because each new cell is of the same size as the original one. For example, if rules say that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> becomes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ab</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> becomes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ca</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, then after two nights a seed will evolve to a trunk consisting of 4 cells: <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>abca</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.<P>Therefore the top of a Morphic is usually hidden in clouds. The only way to tell if it is still alive is to check if visible part of the trunk is changing colors. In order to do so, one can build enormously high (yet still of constant height) tower, and watch from its top a fixed fragment of the trunk.<P>As you can easily see, it is either sufficient to observe first <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> cells from the bottom for some fixed <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, or no matter how high the tower is, you will not be able to tell for sure if a Morphic died. The latter happens when for every <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, rules cause the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th cell to eventually stop changing colors, even though the tree is still alive and mutating.<P>To prevent waste of money on building such enormous towers, you are to write a program that determines if it is possible to monitor health of a Morphic.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several Morphics descriptions.

The Academy employs exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> professors; each of them has to give exactly one lecture. As their schedules are rather tight (they are professors, remember?), the starting and the ending time of each lecture is already fixed.

There are two strings A and B with equal length. Both strings are made up of lower case letters. Now you have a powerful string painter. With the help of the painter, you can change a segment of characters of a string to any other character you want. That is, after using the painter, the segment is made up of only one kind of character. Now your task is to change A to B using string painter. What's the minimum number of operations?

<P>Henry decides to develop a web site, which will provide the service of transit search. But he can only get the transit data of Guangzhou, so his web site can only support the transit search of Guangzhou. We suppose Guangzhou is 10240 meters by 10240 meters. The coordinate of the top-left corner is (0,0). The coordinate of the bottom-right corner is (10240,10240). The X-axis is from top to bottom and the Y-axis is from left to right. At the beginning, four pictures of the size 10cm by 10 cm make up of the whole map of Guangzhou. They are numbered from 0 to 3. It is to say at the beginning the scale of the map is 1cm:512 meters.

<BR>
One of our judges gets bored! Fortunately a toy named Hanoi Tower is there, which may help him to kill time. You know it well that the toy consists of three stacks and some disks. The size of each disk can be indicated by its radius and thickness. Tired of the usual ways of playing the toy, he devises his new rule. He uses only one stack in the game. Before the game, he colors one disk red, the others blue. Starting with an empty peg, the game runs on turn by turn. Each turn, he puts all the valid blue disks as well as the special red disk, which is not on the stack at the time, into a black box and picks out one blindly. By this way he can select one of the disks in the box with equal possibility. Which disk is so-called valid? It is decided by comparing its radius to the radius of the top-most disk on the stack. If its radius is strictly less than the top-most disk's, it's considered valid. If no disk is on the stack at that time, all the disks are considered valid. If a disk is chosen, our cute judge then puts it on the top of the stack, with one exceptional case, the red one. If the special red disk is chosen, instead of putting it onto the stack, the disk currently at the top of the stack should be removed. Wired, isn't it? 

<P>
The stack's height is given. The game ends when after some turns the total thickness of all the disks on the stack is greater than the stack's height, or the red disk is picked but the stack is empty. By then, the guy may get bored again and start to complain about his tedious work (doesn't he suppose to be a judge?) Could you help us to figure out, after how many turns expectedly will the game last?

It always shows a <b>4</b>-digit value and has a specific unlock code (An integer value). The lock is unlocked only when the unlock code is displayed. This unlock code can be made to appear quickly with the help of some of the special buttons available with that lock. Each button has a number associated with it. When any of these buttons is pressed, the number associated with that button is added with the displayed value and so a new number is displayed. The lock always uses least significant <b>4</b> digits after addition. After creating such a lock, he has found that, it is also very difficult for him to unlock the Ferulock.&nbsp; As a very good friend of Ferdaus, your task is to create a program that will help him to unlock the Ferulock by pressing these buttons minimum number of times. </span></p><h5 style='text-align:justify'><span class=stylearial16pt><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></span></h5><h5 style='text-align:justify'><span class=stylearial16pt><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Input</span></span></h5><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

In order to make the race as exciting as possible, the total length of the track should be maximized without exceeding the damage value.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<P>Bio-HRQ-Comparator is a fully automatic computer based neurological scanning system that scans brains of three persons simultaneously and ranks them 1, 2, 3 with respect to their HRQ (Human Resource Quotient) for a given activity. Bio-HRQ-Comparator has three specially designed chairs each fitted with brain scanning devise. Exactly three persons are to sit on the chairs and just think independently and simultaneously on the best possible solution of a given problem related to an activity for which HRQ is tested. The thinking process continues for a specified duration of time that is dependent on the complexity of the given problem. Bio-HRQ-Comparator captures the thinking process and ranks them with respect to their HRQ without any further scrutiny. Through rigorous testing and analysis, ranking by BioHRQ-comparator has been found to be so precise that no two ranked persons are identified to have different rank order or found to have the same HRQ.<P>The system has the potential to replace the traditional method of selection of candidates through interview, where the basic problem is to arrive at total ordering and ranking of a given set of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> (assume <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4415img1.png ALT="$ \le$">20</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) candidates with respect to their HRQ for a specific job. It is proposed to select arbitrarily <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> sets of three candidates each and rank candidates in each set using Bio-HRQ-comparator hoping that total ordering and ranking of candidates can be done successfully. However it is not always possible to arrive at total ordering and ranking of all <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> candidates using arbitrarily selected <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> sets of candidates.<P>You are required to write a program that either ranks all <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> candidates, if possible, using the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> results obtained so far or determines the minimum number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> of additional BioHRQ-comparator testing required for determining the total ordering and ranking of all <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> candidates. In case <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> additional testing are required, the program should identify <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> sets of three candidates each, for additional Bio-HRQ-comparator testing. Assume for simplicity that a candidate is not required to appear more than twice for additional testing.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Input may contain multiple test cases.

<P>Chain shopping is a new scheme introduced at a Mall to promote sale. Mall offers normal discount on every item. Under the scheme a customer makes a list of distinct items to be purchased. The list is called a purchase chain.

<P>Game U-turn is a card game of patience, played by a single player. Given a sequence of cards with some cards face up and others face down at arbitrary positions, a player is required to perform a series of operation called U-turn to make all cards face up without altering positions of cards in the sequence. A U-turn operation is performed on a sub-string of cards of any length to u-turn the face of each card in the sub-string, i.e., if the face of a card is up then put it down and if it is down then put it up, without altering positions of cards in the sub-string. The effort of a U-turn operation is the length of the sub-string on which the operation is performed. The series of U-turns should be such that the effort of each U-turn operation is distinct and the total effort of the series of operations is minimum.<P>Write a program to find the total minimum effort required to make all cards of a given sequence face up using a series of U-turn operation.

After years as a brick-layer, you've been called upon to analyze the instability of brick walls. The instability of a wall can be approximated by the maximum damage to a wall in case of taking one brick out. A brick will fall if all bricks that are directly underneath it are removed. Note that if the space underneath a brick is partially empty, it does not fall. You are given the description of all bricks in a wall, and must determine the instability of the wall as described in the following sections.

A new computer game has just arrived and as an active and always-in-the-scene player, you should finish it before the next university term starts. At each stage of this game, you have to shoot an enemy robot on its weakness point. The weakness point of a robot is always the ``center of mass" of its 2D shape in the screen. Fortunately, all robot shapes are simple polygons with uniform density and you can write programs to calculate exactly the center of mass for each polygon. 

<P>

<P>A <SPAN CLASS="textit">plotter</SPAN> is a vector graphics printing device that connects to a computer to print graphical plots. There are two types of plotters: <SPAN CLASS="textit">pen plotters</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="textit">electrostatic plotters</SPAN>. Pen plotters print by moving a pen across the surface of a piece of paper. They can draw complex line art, including text, but do so very slowly because of the mechanical movement of the pens. In this problem, we are considering this matter of slowness for our special type of pen plotter. A <SPAN CLASS="textit">discrete horizontal pen plotter</SPAN> can draw only horizontal line segments whose end points have discrete coordinates (integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>'s). The drawing method is quite simple. The pen starts its journey from the upper left corner of the page <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I> = <I>y</I> = 0)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and moves only right while drawing the specified lines on that row. Then, it moves back completely to the left, moves one row down <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>y</I> <IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4429img1.png ALT="$ \leftarrow$"> <I>y</I> + 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and repeats this task for the second row. The same is done for the next rows. In other words, the pen can move down only when it is far on the left side (i.e. when <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I> = 0</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>), and can have at most one left-to-right pass and at most one right-to-left pass on each row.<P>It takes one unit of time to move the pen one unit of length to the left <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I> <IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4429img1.png ALT="$ \leftarrow$"> <I>x</I> - 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, or to the right <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I> <IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4429img1.png ALT="$ \leftarrow$"> <I>x</I> + 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. This time is doubled if the pen is on the paper and is drawing a line segment. It takes no time to move one row down (when <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I> = 0</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>).<P>Since it might take a long time for the plotter to draw all the given line segments, we have decided to add a new feature to our plotter: drawing <SPAN CLASS="textit">time-limit</SPAN>. By specifying the time-limit, the plotter should draw the maximum number of lines (using the same drawing method given above) that can be drawn within that time-limit. Given the time-limit and line segments, you should find this maximum number.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains multiple test cases.

<P>In the recent parliament election, none of the parties have vast majority of seats, so there should be a coalition to select the members of the Management Board, which are one speaker, two deputy speakers and six secretaries. The board has a special voting system: the speaker has 25 votes, deputy speakers have 8 votes and each secretary has 1 vote.<P>ACM party decides to take a commanding role and shape the coalition, but they are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> seats short to have a majority. They know the number of seats that every other party has taken.

Have you ever thought about comparing the weight of fruits? That's what you should do in this problem! Given a series of fruit weight comparisons, you should anticipate the result of another comparison. In this problem, all fruits of the same kind are identical and have the same weights. Each fruit weight comparison is something like ``<!-- MATH
 $a \ X \le b \ Y$
 -->

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> are fruit names. Such a comparison means that the weight of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> fruits of type <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is less than or equal to the weight of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>

Mystery Science Theater 3000 is about to start, which means it's time for ``Robot Roll Call", where the name of each robot is called out, as per the list received from Earth. The expectation is that if a robot is there, it will respond by adding its name to a data stream which is then sent back to Earth. Unfortunately today, once the roll is received, communication with Earth is temporarily lost. In the meantime, the robots that are present for roll call have saved their names to the data stream. However, lots of other things are also being saved to this same stream. To help extract data later, any data placed in the stream is separated by whitespace. Once the communication problems are resolved, the contents of this stream are relayed to Earth.

<P>
Your task is as follows. Given a list of names for roll call, you must scan the accompanying data stream and determine if a given name is there. For each name that is in the roll call, report whether or not that name was in the data stream. For a name to be a match, it must appear <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">EXACTLY</SPAN> as shown in the roll. This means a match is case-sensitive and sub-string matches are not allowed.

The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submittal of the first accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every previously rejected run for that problem. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>Quite simply, one element of the optimal strategy is <SPAN CLASS="textbf">not</SPAN> to have any erroneous submissions, so the androids do not have to worry about the penalty minutes. All that remains is to determine the order in which they should submit problems.<P>Let's assume perfect knowledge -- hey, these androids are <SPAN CLASS="textbf">good</SPAN> -- so that they can make a very good estimate of the development time required for each of the problems. The task is to determine the <SPAN CLASS="textit">order</SPAN> in which the problems should be submitted. The androids realize that their best approach is for each to think independently about different problems rather than having all three work on a single problem. Furthermore, each android types infinitely fast, and does not use the computer terminal while thinking. Hence, up to three problems can be simultaneously in progress at any given time, and it is actually possible for all three bots to submit a problem within the same minute. For the same reason, the number of problems posed is larger than those posed in the contest for biological entities. Being innately fussy, if there are multiple ways to submit the problems and obtain the same score, they will submit the problem order that comes lexicographically first.<P>Determine the algorithm to solve the most problems and to obtain the best possible score for those problems.

<P>Marvin, the robot with a brain the size of a planet, followed some . . . markedly less successful robots as the product line developed. One such was Monroe, the robot -- except, to help him recognize his name, he was referred to as Moe. He is sufficiently mentally challenged that he needs external assistance to handle symbolic logic.<P>Polish notation is the prefix symbolic logic notation developed by Jan Lukasiewicz (1929). [Hence postfix expressions are referred to as being in Reverse Polish Notation -- RPN.] The notation developed by Lukasiewicz (referred to as PN below) uses upper-case letters for the logic operators and lower-case letters for logic variables (which can only be <SPAN CLASS="textbf">true</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="textbf">false</SPAN>). Since prefix notation is self-grouping, there is no need for precedence, associativity, or parentheses, unlike infix notation. In the following table the PN operator is shown, followed by its operation. Operators not having exactly equivalent C/C++/Java operators are shown in the truth table (using <TT>1</TT> for <SPAN CLASS="textbf">true</SPAN> and <TT>0</TT> for <SPAN CLASS="textbf">false</SPAN>). [The operator J is not found in Lukasiewicz' original work but is included from A.N.Prior's treatment.]<P><P><BR><IMG WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="256" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4437img1.png ALT="$\textstyle \parbox{.5\textwidth}{

A combination of symbols will fail to be a ``well-formed formula" if it is composed of a WFF followed by extraneous text, it uses an unrecognized character [uppercase character not in the above table or a non-alphabetic character], or it has insufficient operands for its operators. For invalid expressions, report the <SPAN CLASS="textbf"><SPAN CLASS="textit">first</SPAN></SPAN> error discovered in a left-toright scan of the expression. For instance, immediately report an error on an invalid character. If a valid WFF is followed by extraneous text, report that as the error, even if the extraneous text has an invalid character.<P>In addition, every WFF can be categorized as a tautology (true for all possible variable values), a contradiction (false for all possible variable values), or a contingent expression (true for some variable values, false for other variable values).<P>The simplest contingent expression is simply ``<TT>p</TT>", true when <TT>p</TT> is true, false when <TT>p</TT> is false. One very simple contradiction is ``<TT>KpNp</TT>", both <TT>p</TT> and not-<TT>p</TT> are true. Similarly, one very simple tautology is ``<TT>ApNp</TT>", either <TT>p</TT> is true or not-<TT>p</TT> is true.

Modern data centers often use large storage arrays to hold the
storage used by the servers.  The arrays take a set of physical disk
drives, remap them to LUNs (logical units), then present those LUNs
to the servers.  To the server operating system, these LUNs appear to
be disk drives that are connected to the server, in the same way that
physical drives connected directly by cables do.  The storage arrays
can present logical units of arbitrary sizes, provide built-in
redundancy for reliability, and provide other advanced storage
management features.
<P>
There are several protocols that can be used between servers and
storage arrays, but the most common at present is Fibre Channel.  A
server has one or more Fibre Channel Host Bus Adapter (HBA) ports that
connect to Fibre Channel switch(es).  An array also has one or more
(usually several) Fibre Channel ports that connect to the switches.
Logical paths between the servers and arrays are defined in the
switches-these paths are known as zones.
<P>

</DIV>

<P>
An array has LUNs of varying sizes defined on it, and these LUNs are
presented to specific servers using specified Fibre Channel ports on
the array.  A LUN may be presented to more than one server.
<P>
Server and array Fibre Channel ports are identified by their ``Port
World Wide Name" (PWWN).  A PWWN is a globally-unique 64-bit address.
A server sees the PWWNs of the arrays it uses storage on; the array
sees the PWWNs of the servers that connect to it.  The server PWWNs
are used to define which servers have access to each LUN.
<P>
Over time, servers are added and removed from large data centers.
The storage administrators are certainly notified when servers are
added so they can create and allocate new LUNs-but they are not
necessarily notified when servers are removed or server
configurations change.  This means that there may be storage on an
array that is configured but not actually in use (``dark" or
``stranded" storage).  It is not unheard of for terabytes of storage
to be stranded in large data centers.
<P>
There are commercial tools that cost thousands of dollars to help
find this storage (among other features).  However, in the interest
of saving money, the management of one such data center has decided
to ask programming contest teams to develop a tool to find stranded
storage instead.

<P>
The relationships between the storage array LUNs, the servers, and
the switches are defined in pairwise relationships:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A LUN is mapped to a storage port (possibly more than one)
</LI>
<LI>A LUN is masked to a server HBA (possibly more than one)
</LI>
<LI>A storage port has a PWWN
</LI>
<LI>A server has one or more server HBAs, each with a PWWN
</LI>
<LI>A switch zone connects a storage PWWN to a server HBA PWWN
 (a given storage PWWN may be zoned to multiple server HBA PWWNs, and
 a given server HBA PWWN may be zoned to multiple storage PWWNs)
</LI>
<LI>A server file system resides on a LUN or logical volume
 (a LUN may hold multiple server file systems)
</LI>
<LI>A server logical volume uses one or more LUNs
</LI>
</UL>

A server HBA or port PWWN is a 64-bit value expressed as eight pairs

A LUN ID is a hexadecimal value from 0 to FFFF<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUB>16</SUB></SPAN>.  Case is not
significant.  The same LUN ID value may be used on different storage

<P>
For a storage LUN to be used, it must be mapped to a storage port,
masked to one or more HBAs on one or more servers, connected with one
or more zones between the storage port(s) and the server(s), and then
used on one or more file systems.  A server file system may reside
directly on a LUN or use a logical volume that is made up of one or
more LUNs.
<P>
Your program is to read a set of descriptions as defined above and
determine which storage LUNs are defined in LUN mapping or masking
entries but are not actually in use.

<P>
If you think participating in a programming contest is stressful, imagine being an air traffic controller. With human lives at stake, an air traffic controller has to focus on tasks while working under constantly changing conditions as well as dealing with unforeseen events. 

<P>
Consider the task of scheduling the airplanes that are landing at an airport. Incoming airplanes report their positions, directions, and speeds, and then the controller has to devise a landing schedule that brings all airplanes safely to the ground. Generally, the more time there is between successive landings, the ``safer" a landing schedule is. This extra time gives pilots the opportunity to react to changing weather and other surprises. 

<P>
Luckily, part of this scheduling task can be automated - this is where you come in. You will be given scenarios of airplane landings. Each airplane has a time window during which it can safely land. You must compute an order for landing all airplanes that respects these time windows. Furthermore, the airplane landings should be stretched out as much as possible so that the minimum time gap between successive landings is as large as possible. For example, if three airplanes land at 10:00am, 10:05am, and 10:15am, then the smallest gap is five minutes, which occurs between the first two airplanes. Not all gaps have to be the same, but the smallest gap should be as large as possible.

<P>A logic circuit maps its input through various gates to its output with no feedback loops in the circuit.

<P>Carl the ant is back! When we last left him (Problem A, 2004 World Finals), Carl was a little mixed-up, always taking strange, zigzag paths when traveling. But now, Carl has straightened out his life - literally. He now always takes the straightest, shortest path between any pair of points. This sounds simple, except for one small thing: Carl now spends most of his time on a paperweight in the shape of a regular octahedron.

Handling traffic congestion is a difficult challenge for young urban planners. Millions of drivers, each with different goals and each making independent choices, combine to form a complex system with sometimes predictable, sometimes chaotic behavior. As a devoted civil servant, you have been tasked with optimizing rushhour traffic over collections of roads. 

<P>
All the roads lie between a residential area and a downtown business district. In the morning, each person living in the residential area drives a route to the business district. The morning commuter traffic on any particular road travels in only one direction, and no route has cycles (morning drivers do not backtrack). 

<P>
Each road takes a certain time to drive, so some routes are faster than others. Drivers are much more likely to choose the faster routes, leading to congestion on those roads. In order to balance the traffic as much as possible, you are to add tolls to some roads so that the perceived ``cost" of every route ends up the same. However, to avoid annoying drivers too much, you must not levy a toll on any driver twice, no matter which route he or she takes. 

<P>
Figure 5 shows a collection of five roads that form routes from the residential area (at intersection 1) to the downtown business district (at intersection 4). The driving cost of each road is written in large blue font. The dotted arrows show the three possible routes from 1 to 4. Initially the costs of the routes are 10, 8 and 12. After adding a toll of cost 2 to the road connecting 1 and 4 and a toll of cost 4 to the road connecting 3 and 4, the cost of each route becomes 12.

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 5: Roads connecting residential area at intersection 1 to business district at intersection 4

<P>
You must determine which roads should have tolls and how much each toll should be so that every route from start to finish has the same cost (driving time cost + possible toll) and no route contains more than one toll road. Additionally, the tolls should be chosen so as to minimize the final cost. In some settings, it might be impossible to impose tolls that satisfy the above conditions.

<P>Uncle Magnus has planted some young saplings on his farm as part of his reforestation project. Unfortunately, deer like to eat tender sapling shoots and leaves, making it necessary to build protective fences around them. Since deer and other sapling nibblers can reach partway over the fence, every fence must lie at least a minimum distance (a <SPAN CLASS="textit">margin</SPAN>) from each sapling.<P>Deer-proof fencing is quite expensive, so Uncle Magnus wants to minimize the total length of fencing used. Your job is to write a program that computes the minimum length of fencing that is required to enclose and protect the saplings. Fences may include both straight and curved segments. You may design a single fence that encloses all saplings or multiple fences that enclose separate groups of saplings.<P>Figure 6 shows two example configurations, each consisting of three saplings with different margin requirements. In the top configuration, which corresponds to the first sample input, the minimum-length solution consists of two separate fences. In the bottom configuration, which corresponds to the second sample input, the minimum-length solution consists of a single fence.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="1033" HEIGHT="974" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/p4450.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4450.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 6: Deer-proof fences.</DIV><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of multiple test cases.

<P>Axel and Birgit like to play a card game in which they build a house of cards, gaining (or losing) credits as they add cards to the house. Since they both have very steady hands, the house of cards never collapses. They use half a deck of standard playing cards. A standard deck has four suits, two are red and two are black. Axel and Birgit use only two suits, one red, one black. Each suit has 13 ranks. We use the notation <TT>1R</TT>, <TT>2R</TT>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN>, <TT>13R</TT>, <TT>1B</TT>, <TT>2B</TT>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN>, <TT>13B</TT> to denote ranks and colors.<P>The players begin by selecting a subset of the cards, usually all cards of rank up to some maximum value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>. After shuffling the modified deck, they take eight cards from the top of the deck and place them consecutively from left to right to form four ``peaks." For instance, if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I> = 13</SPAN> and if the first ten cards (from 26) are:<P><TT>6B 3R 5B 2B 1B 5R 13R 7B 11R 1R</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN><P>then the game starts off with four peaks and three valleys as shown in Figure 7.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="469" HEIGHT="190" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/p4451.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4451.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 7: Peaks and valleys formed by the top 8 cards in the deck.</DIV><P>The remaining cards are placed face up, in a single row.<P>Each player is identified with a color, red or black. Birgit is always black and Axel is always red. The color of the first card used for the peaks and valleys determines which player has the first turn. For the example in Figure 7, Birgit has the first turn since the first card is <TT>6B</TT>.<P>Players alternate taking turns. A turn consists of removing the card from the front of the row of cards and then doing one of the following:<P><OL><LI>Holding the card until the next turn (this is a ``held card"). </LI><LI>Covering the valley between two peaks with the drawn card or the held card, forming a ``floor". The remaining card, if any, is held. </LI><LI>Placing two cards over a floor, forming a peak (one of the cards must be a ``held'' card). </LI></OL><P>Not all options are always available. At most one card may be held at any time, so the first option is possible only if the player is not already holding a card.<P>Since the cards in the row are face up, both players know beforehand the order in which the cards are drawn.<P>If the player forms a downward-pointing triangle by adding a floor, or an upward-pointing triangle by adding a peak, then the scores are updated as follows. The sum of the ranks of the three cards in the triangle is added to the score of the player whose color is the same as the majority of cards in the triangle. If no triangle is formed during a play, both scores remain unchanged.<P>In the example from Figure 7, if Birgit places her card (<TT>11R</TT>) on the middle valley, she gains 14 points. If she places her card on the left valley, Axel gains 19 points. If she places her card on the right valley, Axel gains 29 points.<P>If no more cards remain to be drawn at the end of a turn, the game is over. If either player holds a card at this time, the rank of that card is added to (subtracted from) that player's score if the color of the card is the same as (different from) that player's color.<P>When the game is over, the player with the lower score pays a number of Swedish Kronor (Kronor is the plural of Krona) equal to the difference between the two scores to the other player. In case of a tie there is no pay out.<P>You must write a program that takes a description of a shuffled deck and one of the players' names and find the highest amount that player can win (or the player's minimum loss), assuming that the other player always makes the best possible moves.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input file contains multiple test cases representing different games.

The ministers of the remote country of Stanistan are having severe problems with their decision making. It all started a few weeks ago when a new process for deciding which bills to pass was introduced. This process works as follows. During each voting session, there are several bills to be voted on. Each minister expresses an opinion by voting either ``yes" or ``no" for some of these bills. Because of limitations in the design of the technical solution used to evaluate the actual voting, each minister may vote on only at most four distinct bills (though this does not tend to be a problem, as most ministers only care about a handful of issues). Then, given these votes, the bills that are accepted are chosen in such a way that each minister gets more than half of his or her opinions satisfied. 

<P>
As the astute reader has no doubt already realized, this process can lead to various problems. For instance, what if there are several possible choices satisfying all the ministers, or even worse, what if it is impossible to satisfy all the ministers? And even if the ministers' opinions lead to a unique choice, how is that choice found? 

<P>
Your job is to write a program to help the ministers with some of these issues. Given the ministers' votes, the program must find out whether all the ministers can be satisfied, and if so, determine the decision on those bills for which, given the constraints, there is only one possible choice.

<P><SPAN CLASS="textit">Struts</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="textit">springs</SPAN> are devices that determine the way in which rectangular windows on a screen are resized or repositioned when the enclosing window is resized. A window occupies a rectangular region of the screen, and it can enclose other windows to yield a hierarchy of windows. When the outermost window is resized, each of the immediately enclosed windows may change position or size (based on the placement of struts and springs); these changes may then affect the position and/or size of the windows they enclose.<P>A <SPAN CLASS="textit">strut</SPAN> is conceptually a fixed length rod placed between the horizontal or vertical edges of a window, or between an edge of a window and the corresponding edge of the immediately enclosing window. When a strut connects the vertical or horizontal edges of a window, then the height or width of that window is fixed. Likewise, when a strut connects an edge of a window to the corresponding edge of the immediately enclosing window, then the distance between those edges is fixed. <SPAN CLASS="textit">Springs</SPAN>, however, may be compressed or stretched, and may be used in place of struts.<P>Each window except the outermost has six struts or springs associated with it. One connects the vertical edges of the window, and another connects the horizontal edges of the window. Each of the other four struts or springs connects an edge of the window with the corresponding edge of the enclosing window. The sum of the lengths of the three vertical struts or springs equals the height of the enclosing window; similarly, the sum of the lengths of the three horizontal struts or springs equals the width of the enclosing window. When the enclosing window's width changes, any horizontal springs connected to the window are stretched or compressed in equal proportion, so that the new total length of struts and springs equals the new width. A similar action takes place for a change in the enclosing window's height. If all three vertical or horizontal components are struts, then the top or rightmost strut, respectively, is effectively replaced by a spring.<P>You must write a program that takes the initial sizes and positions of a set of windows (with one window guaranteed to enclose all others), the placement of struts and springs, and requests to resize the outermost window and then determines the modified size and position of each window for each size request.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Input consists of multiple test cases corresponding to different sets of windows.

The next two integers give the initial width and height of the window. Each of the final six integers is either 0 (for a strut) or 1 (for a spring).

<P>Like most modern cities, Stockholm has a well-developed public transportation system. The heart of public transportation in Stockholm is the subway. A topological map of the subway system illustrates the different subway lines and how they are connected, as illustrated in Figure 8.

Fortunately, those travel times are known, so you do not have to measure the times yourself. But the actual travel times are given in seconds, while the times must be written on the map as estimates of integral numbers of minutes.<P>A natural way of estimating times might be to simply round all the travel times to the nearest minute. However, this can cause huge cumulative errors. For instance, in the Stockholm map, this estimation method could result in an error as large as 15 minutes in the total travel time between some pairs of stations. In order to counter this, your program may choose to round some travel times up and round other travel times down.

<P>As computer programmers, you have likely heard about regular expressions and context-free grammars. These are rich ways of generating sets of strings over a small alphabet (otherwise known as a formal language). There are other, more esoteric ways of generating languages, such as tree-adjoining grammars, context-sensitive grammars, and unrestricted grammars. This problem uses a new method for generating a language: a suffixreplacement grammar.<P>A suffix-replacement grammar consists of a starting string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> and a set of suffix-replacement rules. Each rule is of the form <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I> <IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4455img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"> <I>Y</I></SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> are equal-length strings of alphanumeric characters. This rule means that if the suffix (that is, the rightmost characters) of your current string is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN>, you can replace that suffix with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>. These rules may be applied arbitrarily many times.<P>For example, suppose there are 4 rules A <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4455img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> B, AB <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4455img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> BA, AA <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4455img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> CC, and CC <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4455img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> BB. You can then transform the string AA to BB using three rule applications: AA <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4455img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> AB (using the A <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4455img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> B rule), then AB <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4455img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> BA (using the AB <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4455img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> BA rule), and finally BA <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4455img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> BB (using the A <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4455img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> B rule again). But you can also do the transformation more quickly by applying only 2 rules: AA <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4455img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> CC and then CC <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4455img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> BB.<P>You must write a program that takes a suffix-replacement grammar and a string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> and determines whether the grammar's starting string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> can be transformed into the string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>. If this is possible, the program must also find the minimal number of rule applications required to do the transformation.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of several test cases.

<P>During junior chess tournaments, a player may be paired in matches with another player of a different age. However, at the end of the tournament, players with the best score for each age (where age is calculated on the day of the tournament) are recognized separately. In the case of a tie, all players attaining the highest score are recognized. For the sake of clarity, a birthday is defined as the day that a person turns a year older. For example, a person born on the 2nd June 1996 is five (5) years old on the 1st June 2002, is six (6) years old on the 2nd June 2002 and will be considered in the age category of six (6) in a tournament held on the 2nd June 2002. Note that a person born on the 29th February becomes a year older on the 29th February in leap years and on the 1st March in non-leap years.<P>Your task is to write a program to identify the winners, and co-winners, amongst those participating in a junior chess tournament.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input starts with an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4457img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>N</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/4457img1.png ALT="$ \le$">200</SPAN>, on a separate line that represents the number of contests to be processed.

In the land of ACMania the calendar is somewhat different to the Gregorian 
calendar that we are familiar with and use. The ACManian Calendar does not 
have 12 months and the months have an irregular number of days in them. 
They do, however still have a moon and it has a regular cycle with full moons 
being exactly the same number of days apart from each other. When the moon 
is full for the second time in the month, they call that a Blue Moon. Whenever 
there is a Blue Moon, the ACManians have a Blue Moon Festival that

The input consists of a series of scenarios for calculating the date of the next 
Blue Moon Festival. The first line in each scenario consists of a positive 
integer, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>, which is the number of months in the year <!-- MATH

<P>Mr. Walker is a person who is known for his ability to walk fast. He accepts an attractive offer to get as much free land as he can cover by a walk on an open uneven huge piece of land within a specified time and following certain conditions.<P>A walk is a sequence of paths, starting at a marked spot on the land and ending at the same spot where the walk starts. The first path in a walk begins at the marked spot and extends in one of the four directions: North (<TT>N</TT>), South (<TT>S</TT>), East (<TT>E</TT>) or West (<TT>W</TT>). It ends at the point where the direction changes.<P>Each of the other paths in a walk begins at the point where the previous path ends and ends either at a point where the direction changes or when the walk ends.

When he changes a direction he must keep the direction always to one of the four directions <TT>N</TT>, <TT>S</TT>, <TT>E</TT> or <TT>W</TT>. Paths are distinct and nonintersecting; for example, a path in <TT>E</TT> or <TT>W</TT> direction cannot cross another in <TT>N</TT> or <TT>S</TT> direction.<P>Given a walk, you are required to write a program that finds the area of land covered by the walk.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of multiple test cases.<P>For each test case there is only one input line.

<P>Suppose there are some groups of friends who all believe fervently in numerology. They decide to choose the best group among them by aligning the vowels of their names. In order to account for mismatches in the number of vowels, a special symbol `<TT>-</TT>' is introduced that can augment the total number of vowels to make them the same. A symmetric matrix of size <SPAN CLASS="MATH">6 <TT>x</TT> 6</SPAN> is conceived to encode the scores of matching each vowel plus the gap to every other vowel and the gap. Even though the scores can be positive and negative, certain constraints apply.<P>For example, the score of a vowel with itself is positive, while that of a gap with any character (including another gap) is negative. When aligning their names, the column-wise scores are accumulated. For each column, the score is the cumulative of the pair-wise scores.

<P>A couple of years ago, a new world wide crisis started, leaving many people with economical problems. Some workers of a particular company are trying to ask for an increase in their salaries.<P>The company has a strict hierarchy, in which each employee has exactly one direct boss, with the exception of the owner of the company that has no boss. Employees that are not bosses of any other employee are called <SPAN CLASS="textit">workers</SPAN>. The rest of the employees and the owner are called <SPAN CLASS="textit">bosses</SPAN>.<P>To ask for a salary increase, a worker should file a petition to his direct boss. Of course, each boss is encouraged to try to make their subordinates happy with their current income, making the company's profit as high as possible. However, when at least <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> percent of its direct subordinates have filed a petition, that boss will be pressured and have no choice but to file a petition himself to his own direct boss. Each boss files at most 1 petition to his own direct boss, regardless on how many of his subordinates filed him a petition.

<P>In the land of ACM ruled a great King who became obsessed with order. The kingdom had a rectangular form, and the King divided the territory into a grid of small rectangular <SPAN CLASS="textit">counties</SPAN>. Before dying, the King distributed the counties among his sons.<P>However, he was unaware that his children had developed a strange rivalry: the first heir hated the second heir, but not the rest; the second heir hated the third heir, but not the rest, and so on ...Finally, the last heir hated the first heir, but not the other heirs.<P>As soon as the King died, the strange rivalry among the King's sons sparked off a generalized war in the kingdom. Attacks only took place between pairs of adjacent counties (adjacent counties are those that share one vertical or horizontal border). A county <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> attacked an adjacent county <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> whenever the owner of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> hated the owner of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>. The attacked county was always conquered by the attacking brother. By a rule of honor all the attacks were carried out simultaneously, and a set of simultaneous attacks was called a <SPAN CLASS="textit">battle</SPAN>. After a certain number of battles, the surviving sons made a truce and never battled again.<P>For example, if the King had three sons, named 0, 1 and 2, the figure below shows what happens in the first battle for a given initial land distribution:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="790" HEIGHT="259" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/p4473.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4473.eps}"></DIV><P>You were hired to help an ACM historian determining, given the number of heirs, the initial land distribution and the number of battles, what was the land distribution after all battles.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several test cases.

<P>The University administration plans to build a new dinner hall, to replace the several small (and rather inadequate) dinner halls spread over the campus. To estimate the number of places needed in the new dinner hall, they performed an experiment to measure the maximum total number of clients inside the existing dinner halls at any time. They hired several students as <SPAN CLASS="textit">pollers</SPAN>, and positioned one poller at each entrance and each exit of the existing dinner halls. The pollers' task was to note in small cards the time each client entered or exited the hall (one card for each event). In each card they wrote the time, in the format HH:MM:SS, and the associated event (letter `<TT>E</TT>' for an entry, letter `<TT>X</TT>' for and exit).<P>The experiment started in the morning, before breakfast, and ended in the evening, after dinner. The pollers had their watches synchronized, and the halls were empty both before and after the experiment (that is, no client was inside a hall before the experiment began, and no client remained in a hall after the experiment ended). The pollers wrote exactly one card for every client who entered a hall and for every client who exited a hall.<P>After the experiment, the cards were collected and sent to the administration for processing. The task, however, was not as easy as planned, because two problems were detected. Firstly, the cards were bunched together in no particular order and therefore needed sorting; that is fairly easy, but time-consuming to do by hand. But what is worse is that, although all cards had a valid time, some pollers forgot to write the letter specifying the event. The University administration decided they needed help from an expert!<P>Given a set of cards with times and the indication of the event (the indication of the event may be missing), write a program to determine the maximum number of clients that could possibly had been inside the dinner halls in a given instant of time.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several test cases.

This means that, when calculating the amount to pay, the first 100 CWh have a price of 2 
Americus each; the next 9900 CWh (between 101 and 10000) have a price of 3 Americus each 
and so on. 

<P>
For instance, if you consume 10123 CWh you will have to pay <!-- MATH
 $2 \times 100+3 \times 9900 +
5 \times 123 = 30515$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">2 <TT>x</TT> 100 + 3 <TT>x</TT> 9900 + 5 <TT>x</TT> 123 = 30515</SPAN> Americus. 

<P>
The evil mathematicians from the company have found a way to gain even more money. Instead 
of telling you how much energy you have consumed and how much you have to pay, they will 
show you two numbers related to yourself and to a random neighbor: 

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>A:</DT>
<DD>the total amount to pay if your consumptions were billed together; and 
</DD>
<DT>B:</DT>
<DD>the absolute value of the difference between the amounts of your bills. 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
If you can't figure out how much you have to pay, you must pay another 100 Americus for such 
a ``service". You are very economical, and therefore you are sure you cannot possibly 
consume more than any of your neighbors. So, being smart, you know you can compute how 
much you have to pay. For example, suppose the company informed you the following two 
numbers: <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I> = 1100</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I> = 300</SPAN>. Then you and your neighbor's consumptions had to be 150 CWh 
and 250 CWh respectively. The total consumption is 400 CWh and then <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> is <!-- MATH
 $2 \times 100 + 3
\times 300 = 1100$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">2 <TT>x</TT> 100 + 3 <TT>x</TT> 300 = 1100</SPAN>. You have to pay <!-- MATH
 $2 \times 100 + 3 \times 50 = 350$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">2 <TT>x</TT> 100 + 3 <TT>x</TT> 50 = 350</SPAN> Americus, while your 
neighbor must pay <!-- MATH
 $2 \times 100 + 3 \times 150 = 650$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">2 <TT>x</TT> 100 + 3 <TT>x</TT> 150 = 650</SPAN> Americus, so <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> is <!-- MATH
 $|350 - 650| = 300$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">| 350 - 650| = 300</SPAN>.

<P>Your school has a computer that is used as a web server for hosting its institutional web site, personal pages of the staff, sites for research groups, subjects, and many others.<P>Recently, the hard disk table was corrupted, so the organization of all the files was lost. Sadly enough, there are no backups of that information. The only hope is to look through the entire disk data and try to find out which parts correspond to each file. Fortunately, the disk was using a file system that kept each individual file contiguous, so only contiguous pieces of data need to be inspected.<P>The disk data is a sequence of bytes. Each byte in this particular disk can store an English alphabet letter (distinguishing lowercase and uppercase), a decimal digit, a point or a comma, making a total of 64 different characters.<P>While you were thinking about how to solve the problem, you suddenly remembered that the file system also maintained multiple copies of each file, so only the pieces of contiguous bytes that are repeated had a chance of being a file. Moreover, for each repetition of the same contiguous bytes, only one copy needs to be checked. For instance, if the data is `<TT>ababcabb</TT>', the contiguous subsequences `<TT>a</TT>', `<TT>b</TT>' and `<TT>ab</TT>' are repeated, but nothing containing `<TT>c</TT>', nor `<TT>ba</TT>' or `<TT>bb</TT>' is.

<P>
In Quadradonia, all rural properties are square, all have the same area, all are perfectly 
flat and all have the sides aligned to the North-South and West-East axes. 

<P>
Since properties are flat, the hills in Quadradonia look like a series of huge stairs' 
steps, with different heights. In a certain mountain, an interesting situation occurs in a 
rectangular area of <!-- MATH
 $N \times M$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>M</I></SPAN> properties. Starting from anywhere within the region, 
traversing it in the West to East direction, the properties have non-descending heights. 
Similarly, traversing that region in the North to South direction, starting from anywhere, 
the properties have also non-descending heights. 

<P>
A large wine company in Quadradonia wants to rent some properties from that region to grow 
wine grapes. The company is interested in some special varieties of wine grapes, which are 
productive only if grown in properties whose heights are within a certain interval. That 
is, the company is interested in renting properties whose heights are equal to or higher 
than a given altitude <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN>, and equal to or lower than a given altitude <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>U</I></SPAN>. To make it easier 
for harvesting, the rented properties must form a contiguous area. And since everyone in 
Quadradonia likes squares, the area to be rented must have the shape of a square. 

<P>
The company has not yet decided which variety of grapes it will grow, and therefore it has 
a list of queries involving intervals, one for each grape variety. The figure below shows 
an area of interest of dimensions <!-- MATH
 $4 \times 5$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">4 <TT>x</TT> 5</SPAN> (in number of properties) with examples of areas 
the company could rent to grow grapes in heights within the intervals given in the picture.

<P>
You must write a program that, given the description of the rectangular area of interest 
in the mountain, and a list of queries containing height intervals, determines, for each 
query, the largest side, in number of properties, of a contiguous square area with heights 
within the specified interval.

<P>In a Latin American high school, the klingon language has become so popular that many of the students have begun learning this artificial language on their own. After becoming aware of the situation, the directors have decided to implement formal klingon courses. The problem is that kids have different starting levels of knowledge of the language. Therefore, the directors decided to offer two course levels: basic and advanced.<P>The school has several divisions, with each student belonging to exactly one division. Because of bureaucracy and schedule conflicts, students of different divisions cannot be in the same klingon course. Also, to be fair, the basic and advanced klingon levels should be offered to all divisions, and have the same level of difficulty among the divisions.<P>Therefore, each division will be partitioned into two groups: one group will be assigned a basic level course, and the other group an advanced level course. It is possible, also, that a division does not contain any students in one of the levels.<P>To assign the levels, a klingon test has been previously taken by all students of the school, each getting an integer grade between 0 and 1000, inclusive. To accomplish the aforementioned goals, the school directors have decided that all students with a score greater than or equal to some <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> will be assigned the advanced level, and all students with a score less than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> will be assigned the basic level.<P>However, they cannot decide on the best value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>. They would like a value that evenly splits all divisions.

You live in a village but work in another village. You decided to follow the straight path 
between your house (A) and the working place (B), but there are several rivers you need 
to cross. Assume B is to the right of A, and all the rivers lie between them. 

<P>
Fortunately, there is one ``automatic" boat moving smoothly in each river. When you arrive 
the left bank of a river, just wait for the boat, then go with it. You're so slim that 
carrying you does not change the speed of any boat. 

<P>
Days and days after, you came up with the following question: assume each boat is 
independently placed at random at time 0, what is the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">expected time</SPAN> to 
reach B from A? Your walking speed is always 1. 

<P>
To be more precise, for a river of length <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN>, the distance of the boat (which could be 
regarded as a mathematical point) to the left bank at time 0 is 
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">uniformly chosen</SPAN> from interval <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[0, <I>L</I>]</SPAN>, and the boat is equally 
like to be moving left or right, if it's not precisely at the river bank.

<P>Jiajia downloads a lot, a lot more than you can even imagine. Some say that he starts downloading up to 20,000 files together. If 20,000 files try to share a limited bandwidth then it will be a big hazard and no files will be downloaded properly. That is why, he uses a download manager.<P>If there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> files to download, the download manger uses the following policy while downloading files:<P><OL><LI>The download manager gives the smaller files higher priority, so it starts downloading the smallest <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> files at startup. If there is a tie, download manager chooses the one with less bytes remaining (for download).

When a file is completely downloaded its bandwidth is instantaneously given to the next file. If there are no more files left except the files that are being downloaded, this bandwidth is immediately shared equally by all remaining files that are being downloaded. </LI></OL><P>Given the size and completed percentage of each file, your task is to intelligently simulate the behavior of the download manager to find the total time required to download all the files.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The will be at most 10 test cases.

So the download manager chooses the 6th, 5th and 4th files for download as they have less bytes remaining. All these files get equal bandwidth (30.00 Megabyte/Sec). Of these three files the 8th file is finished first. So instantaneously the 2nd file starts downloading. Then, 5th file is finished. So the next larger file (3rd file) starts downloading.

<P>You're playing an RPG, which is arguably the best Chinese RPG in 2007. You got to the final combat. You want to win as soon as possible. Do you know what I am talking about?<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">For competitors who're not familiar with the game:</SPAN> we're giving a brief introduction to the combat system and the characters involved in that last combat very soon.<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">For competitors who're too familiar with the game:</SPAN> we're simplifying and/or changing the rules and facts for this problem. We apologize if you feel unhappy about that.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="1203" HEIGHT="901" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/p4488.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4488.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Fig. The final combat</DIV><P>The screenshot above gives you some idea about the combat system and the characters, which can be summarized as follows:<P><P><BR><UL><LI>You have 4 heroes: Yun Tianhe (YTH), Han Lingsha (HLS), Liu Mengli (LML) and Murong Ziying (MRZY). Before the combat begins, you need to choose <SPAN CLASS="textbf">exactly</SPAN> three heroes and rearrange them in some order. Let's call the 1st, 2nd and 3rd hero <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN>, respectively. In this screenshot above, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> is YTH, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> is HLS and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN> is LML. (Sorry for the Ziying fans!) </LI><LI>There are two bosses: Xuan Xiao (XX) and Su Yao (SY), both in the back of the screenshot. </LI><LI>The goal of this combat is to defeat SY. In this problem, you can assume that XX is immortal, although it's possible to defeat him in the real game. </LI></UL><P><P><BR>The key to this problem is to understand the ``semi" round-based combat system. See the ``<SPAN CLASS="textbf">progress bar</SPAN>" on the top of the screen? Each hero has a very small <SPAN CLASS="textbf">progress ball</SPAN> (in light-blue) on the bar, with an icon above the ball. Similarly, each boss also has a ball (in red), but the icon is below the ball. When the combat begins, all the progress balls start moving from the left corner of the bar. When a ball reaches the right corner, the corresponding character is able to act. If more than one character can act, they make actions one by one, according to this precedence order: YTH, HLS, LML, MRZY, XX, SY. When a character is acting, all progress balls stopped moving. After a character finished an action, his/her progress ball is reset to the left corner of the progress bar. When nobody is acting, all progress balls go right simultaneously (but possibly with different speeds, see below).<P><P><BR>In this problem, each character has 4 main properties: <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Jing</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Shen</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Su</I></SPAN>.<P><UL><LI><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Jing</SPAN> means ``health". When a character's <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Jing</I></SPAN> reaches zero or negative, he/she is defeated. A character's maximum <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Jing</I></SPAN> is denoted by parameter <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>maxjing</I></SPAN>. </LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Qi</SPAN> means ``vitality". It is used by special-skill attacks. When <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN> is not enough, certain special-skill attacks cannot be performed. A character's maximum <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN> is always 100. </LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Shen</SPAN> means ``spirit". It is used by Xian Shu (something similar to, but more amazing than ``magic"). When <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Shen</I></SPAN> is not enough, certain Xian Shu cannot be performed. A character's maximum <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Shen</I></SPAN> is denoted by parameter <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>maxshen</I></SPAN>. </LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Su</SPAN> means ``speed". It affects how quick a character's progress ball moves. Su is always a positive integer <SPAN CLASS="textbf">less</SPAN> than 5. If a character's <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Su</I></SPAN> is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>, it takes <SPAN CLASS="MATH">5 - <I>x</I></SPAN> units time for his/her progress ball to move from left corner to the right corner of the progress bar. A character's <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Su</I></SPAN> (which is never changed during the combat) is denoted by parameter <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>su</I></SPAN>. </LI></UL><P><P><BR>For simplicity, you may assume that both XX and SY use the same strategy:<P><P><BR><UL><LI>In his/her <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(4<I>n</I> + 1)</SPAN>-th action <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>n</I> = 0, 1, 2,...)</SPAN>, make a weapon attack upon <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>. </LI><LI>In his/her <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(4<I>n</I> + 2)</SPAN>-th action <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>n</I> = 0, 1, 2,...)</SPAN>, make a weapon attack upon <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>. </LI><LI>In his/her <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(4<I>n</I> + 3)</SPAN>-th action <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>n</I> = 0, 1, 2,...)</SPAN>, make a weapon attack upon <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN>. </LI><LI>In his/her <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(4<I>n</I> + 4)</SPAN>-th action <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>n</I> = 0, 1, 2,...)</SPAN>, make a special-skill attack upon all the heroes. </LI></UL><P>Now we introduce four more parameters for each hero. The first two, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I>1<I>x</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I>2<I>x</I></SPAN>, are the damages that the hero takes on XX's weapon attack and special-skill attack, respectively. For SY's attacks, we define <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I>1<I>s</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I>2<I>s</I></SPAN> similarly.<P>You're very tired, so you don't want to waste your time designing complex tactics. When a hero is about to act, you only consider the following actions:<P><P><BR><UL><LI><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Make a physical weapon attack</SPAN> upon either XX or SY (cannot attack both). Be warned though, SY is surrounded by swords (see the screenshot), so making weapon attacks upon her would hurt the attacker himself/herself. The amount of ``reflection damage" that the attacker takes is the same as the ``physical damage" that SY takes. Attacking XX (yes, you <SPAN CLASS="textbf">can</SPAN> do that, if you like) does <SPAN CLASS="textbf">not</SPAN> suffer from physical reflection. </LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Use Xian Shu to recover Jing.</SPAN> To make your brain easier, you decided <SPAN CLASS="textbf">not</SPAN> to recover other heroes' <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Jing</I></SPAN>. In this problem, the only Xian Shu that you can use is called "Yu Run", which recovers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>yurun</I><IMG WIDTH="44" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/p4488.png ALT="$ \_jing$"></SPAN> points of Jing (if the resulting Jing exceeds his/her maximum Jing, it is reduced to the maximum) and uses <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>yurun</I><IMG WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/p4488.png ALT="$ \_shen$"></SPAN> points of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Shen</I></SPAN>. </LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Use items to recover Shen.</SPAN> To make your brain easier, you decided <SPAN CLASS="textbf">not</SPAN> to recover other heroes' <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Shen</I></SPAN>. In this problem, the only item that you can use is called "Shu Er Guo", which recovers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>shuerguo</I><IMG WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/p4488.png ALT="$ \_shen$"></SPAN> points of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Shen</I></SPAN> (if the resulting <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Shen</I></SPAN> exceeds his/her maximum <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Shen</I></SPAN>, it is reduced to the maximum). You have an infinite number of Shu Er Guo. </LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Make a special-skill attack</SPAN> if his/her <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN> is enough. Each hero has exactly one special-skill attack, attacking both XX and SY. Note that some special-skill attacks are physical. Using a physical special-skill attack makes you take the same damage as SY, just like weapon attacks. </LI></UL><P><P><BR>Now it's time to introduce four more parameters for each hero: <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>wad</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ssd</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ssq</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ssp</I></SPAN>. The number of Jing points that SY takes by the hero's weapon attacks and special-skill attacks are denoted by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>wad</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ssd</I></SPAN>, respectively. The special-skill attack is physical if and only if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ssp</I> = 1</SPAN> (otherwise, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ssp</I> = 0</SPAN>). It needs <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ssq</I></SPAN> points of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN>.<P>As you may have noticed, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN> cannot be recovered by Xian Shu or items. There are only two ways to increase <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN>: make a weapon attack, or get hit by a weapon attack. Being hurt by physical reflection does <SPAN CLASS="textbf">not</SPAN> earn you extra <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN>.<P>So here come the last two parameters for each hero: <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>, that means making a weapon attack increases <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> points of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN> (whether or not you're reflected), while getting hit by a weapon attack increases <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> points of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN>. If the resulting <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN> exceeds his/her maximum <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN> (which is always 100), it is reduced to the maximum. Again, performing a special-skill attack never increases your <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN>. Getting hurt by the bosses' special-skill attacks never increases your <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN>, either.<P>As a perfectionist, you don't want any hero to be defeated even temporarily (in the real game you can rebirth a hero with certain Xian Shu or items) -- for example, it's <SPAN CLASS="textbf">not</SPAN> allowed to make YTH and SY defeated at the same time (it can happen, for example, after YTH has performed a powerful physical special-skill attack).<P>Finally comes the question: what is the earliest time (we only care about ball-moving time, not including time needed to make attacks) that you can win the combat, if you play optimally?

You can't use <TT>HLS</TT>'s weapon attack, since she'll get defeated by physical reflection. <TT>LML</TT>'s weapon attack is weak, but she can use her special-skill attack even though she'll get hurt by reflection (her special-skill attack is physical), since <SPAN CLASS="MATH">400 &lt; 450</SPAN>. For <TT>MRZY</TT>, his special-skill is physical, and too powerful, so we can't use it, since <SPAN CLASS="MATH">700 &gt; 600</SPAN>.<P>To summarize, we can use <TT>YTH</TT>'s weapon attack (damage=300), <TT>HLS</TT>'s special-skill attack (damage=300), <TT>LML</TT>'s weapon attack (damage=100) and special-skill attack (damage=400), and <TT>MRZY</TT>'s weapon attack (damage=250). It's not hard to see, the only possible combination that can finish the combat in the quickest way is <TT>YTH</TT>, <TT>HLS</TT> and <TT>LML</TT> (use special-skill attack), the ordering is arbitrary. Note that the combat ends immediately after SY is defeated, so don't worry about the terrible attacks of XX and SY.<P>In the second sample, <TT>YTH</TT> is too weak so we ignore him immediately. You can't avoid XX's first attack, which is able to defeat everyone except <TT>LML</TT>, so <TT>LML</TT> seems to be the only possible <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>. However, <TT>HLS</TT> moves before XX, so she can also be <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> if she uses Yu Run in her first action. Unfortunately, <TT>MRZY</TT> can't be <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>, since he's not quick enough to recover Jing before XX attacks.<P>All the weapon attacks are too weak, so the best strategy is to accumulate <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN> first, then perform the powerful special-skill attacks when possible. <TT>LML</TT>'s su is too low, but her <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN> is enough at startup. All she needs to do is to recover <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Shen</I></SPAN>, then recover <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Jing</I></SPAN>, and then do the attack (Why so complex? because her powerful special-skill attack is physical <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN>). Note that SY is only able to attack two heroes before the combat ends, so <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN> has one fewer chance to increase <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN> by reflection. Actually, it can be proven that neither <TT>HLS</TT> nor <TT>MRZY</TT> can be <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN> -- if so, they'll be unable to gain enough <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Qi</I></SPAN> for their special-skill attacks.<P>To summarize, <TT>HLS</TT> can be <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>, <TT>LML</TT> can be all, while <TT>MRZY</TT> can only be <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>. So the only possible ordering is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>1</SUB> =</SPAN><TT> HLS</TT>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>2</SUB> =</SPAN><TT> MRZY</TT>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>3</SUB> =</SPAN><TT> LML</TT>.<P>In the third sample, it seems that you can defeat SY with HLS's special-skill attack (damage=6861) and <TT>LML</TT>'s specialskill attack (damage=24850). However, <TT>LML</TT> needs to recover <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Jing</I></SPAN> to avoid being defeated, but her initial <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Shen</I></SPAN> is not enough. If we changed her initial Shen to 543 (enough for Yu Run), the answer would become ``<TT>6 LYH LYM</TT>".<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001003000000000000000">Sample Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P><PRE>

<P>
There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> books on his bookshelf. We define the 
mess value to be the number of segments of <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">consecutive equal-height books</SPAN>. 
For example, if the book heights are 30, 30, 31, 31, 32, the mess value is 3, that of 30, 32, 32, 31 
is also 3, but the mess value of 31, 32, 31, 32, 31 is 5 -- it's indeed in a mess! 

<P>
Bubu wants to reduce the mess value as much as possible, but he's a little bit tired, so he 
decided to take out at most <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> books, then put them back somewhere in the shelf. Could you 
help him?

<P>
I live in a crazy city full of crossings and bidirectional roads connecting them. On most 
of the days, there will be a celebration in one of the crossings, that's why I call this 
city crazy. 

<P>
Everyday, I walk from my home (at crossing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>) to my office (at crossing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I></SPAN>). I don't like 
crowds, but I don't want to waste time either, so I always choose a shortest path among 
all possible paths that does not visit the crossing of the celebration. If no such path 
exists, I don't go to work (it's a good excuse, isn't it)! 

<P>
In order to analyze this ``celebration effect" in detail, I need <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> pairs of values <!-- MATH
 $(l_{i}, c_{i})$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>l</I><SUB>i</SUB>, <I>c</I><SUB>i</SUB>)</SPAN>, 
where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>l</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> is the length of the shortest path from crossing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> to crossing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I></SPAN>, not visiting 
crossing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> is the number of such shortest paths (not visiting crossing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>). Could 
you help me? Note that if I can't go to work when celebration is held at crossing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>, 
define <!-- MATH
 $l_{i}=c_{i}=0$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>l</I><SUB>i</SUB> = <I>c</I><SUB>i</SUB> = 0</SPAN>. This includes the case when there is no path between <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I></SPAN> even if 
there's no celebration at all.

Ah, wait a moment. Please don't directly give me the values - that'll drive me crazy 
(too many numbers!). All I need is finding some interesting conclusions behind the 
values, but currently I've no idea what exactly I want. 

<P>
Before I know what you should calculate, please prove that you can indeed find all the 
pairs <!-- MATH

<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>l</I><SUB>i</SUB>, <I>c</I><SUB>i</SUB>)</SPAN> by telling me the value of <!-- MATH

l_{3}x^{4}+c_{3}x^{5}+\ldots +l_{n}x^{2n-2}+c_{n}x^{2n-1}) \bmod 19880830$

<P>
Jiajia wants to do some experiments on his two-eyed robot. Each eye of the robot shoots a 
very thin laser beam from it, which goes infinitely (i.e. a mathematical ``ray"). Restricted 
by the internal structure, the two laser beams from the eyes must always form a right 
angle (i.e. two rays must be perpendicular to each other). 

<P>
To help the robot localize 
itself, Jiajia placed two linear-shaped special materials called MA and MB. If one of the 
rays intersects with MA, while the other ray intersects with MB, the robot is able to 
gather enough spatial information for the localization.

The weird shape in the picture above is the collection of points from which the robot can

Though the task seems a little bit difficult, can you tell me the total area of these points?

But now, sites like <span class=SpellE>facebook</span>, twitter and communication devices/software like mobile phones, messengers have made the professional match makers jobless. So these angry and jobless match makers have gathered together to make the government pass a law in the parliament that will stop people from choosing their life partners. The law is stated below:</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

Then next senior bachelor will then marry a spinster whose age is nearest to him (of course if there is a tie, marrying anyone of them will do) excluding the spinster that has already got married. This process continues until there is no bachelor or spinster left. Of course a bachelor cannot marry two spinsters and a spinster cannot marry two bachelors. For example in a community there are four bachelors who are 21, 25, 26, 2 years old and four spinsters who are 26, 24, 25 and 35 years old. The diagram below shows the only possibility of marriage: (<span class=SpellE>eg</span>: The 26 year old bachelor marries the 25 years old spinster)</span></p><p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><img width=226 height=205 id="_x0000_i1026" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/44/d_files/image004.gif></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=stylearial16pt><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:normal'>Now given the ages of the bachelors and the Spinsters in a community you will have to find the number of bachelors left, after all the marriages have taken place according to the law mentioned above.

At the start of the game, each cell contains a piece colored red or blue. The two players make moves alternately  SOHA, being player 1, makes the first move. In each move, a player chooses a colored cell (that is a cell with a blue or a red piece in it). After making a move, all the reachable cells from that selected cell vanishes. Two cells are reachable if you can start from one and end on the other by making moves in the direction up, down, left or right and all the pieces in the path has the same color.

font-family:Verdana'>Nadia wants to create two email accounts (one for her personal use and another for official use) in a popular emailing site named <span class=SpellE>bestmail</span>. One of the important parts of creating an account is choosing a password. <span class=SpellE>Bestmail</span> provides some rules for choosing a password. Here are the rules:</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

115%;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Password should not be less than a given integer A.</span></p><p class=listparagraph style='text-align:justify;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>3.</span><span style='font-size:7.0pt;line-height:

font-family:Verdana'>Nadia thinks choosing two different passwords for two different accounts is difficult to remember. So she decided she will choose one integer satisfying the rules for her first account and will use reverse of that integer for the second account. By this way she has to remember the password of first account only. Reverse of an integer can be found by reversing the order of the digits of the integer and removing the leading zeros. For example, reverse of 1203 is 3021, reverse of 1050 is 501.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>After deciding this, she found that many integers are satisfying the rules but reverse of those are not always satisfying the rules. So she is interested about how many options she has to choose a password for her first account so that she can set the password for her second account just by reversing the first password.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p><h5 style='text-align:justify'><span class=stylearial16pt><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Input</span></span></h5><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

The total market value of all its items is around 20 trillion dollars and so guarding them is a very difficult job as antique buyers and businessmen are willing to pay any amount to get hold of them. So the Museum authority does not depend on human guards any more. They have placed many CCTV cameras in the Museum. Now they want to place one high powered, fast revolving CCTV camera at one position of the ceiling. As this type of camera is very costly, so they have decided to install only one such camera per floor.&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

font-family:Verdana'>All floors in the Museum are rectangular shaped and so it is possible to place the camera in a place from where all the valuables items on display can be seen. But there is a problem in the ground floor which also consists of the Head Office of the Museum. The head office has a circular shape and is somewhere strictly within the rectangular room. So it is possible that there are places in the floor from where all the valuable items are not visible. Your job is to find a place from where maximum number of items is visible and report this maximum number of valuable items. You can assume that the museum is so large compared to the valuable items that each valuable items can be denoted by a point in the 2 dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p><div align=center><table class=MsoNormalTable border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 style='border-collapse:collapse;mso-padding-alt:0in 0in 0in 0in'><tr style='mso-yfti-irow:0;mso-yfti-firstrow:yes'><td width=421 valign=top style='width:315.9pt;border:solid windowtext 1.0pt;

The circle is strictly within the rectangular room. You can also assume that walls of the museum are axis-parallel and the coordinate of the lower left corner of the room is at the origin (0, 0). So the coordinate of the upper right corner is (W, H). Each of the next N lines contains two integers which denote the coordinate of one valuable items of the museum. You can safely assume that no two items will be on the same coordinate, all items will be strictly inside the room but no items will be inside the Museum office or even on the boundary of office or room.&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

You dont need to print the coordinate of the place from where maximum number of items is visible because there may be more than one such place. Look at the output for sample input for details.

Every day, you need to go to work from home through a one-way road that can be modeled as a series of straight line segments (aka piece-wise linear) of positive length. To be more explicit, suppose there are one way straight line paths named P, Q and R in your way. P starts at your home &amp; ends at the starting point of Q. Q starts from the ending point of P &amp; ends at starting point of R. Similarly, R starts at ending point of Q &amp; ends at your destination. Two non-adjacent line segments in a road will never intersect with each other. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

font-family:Verdana'>Now, you start from home for work and immediately get irritated by the heavy and annoying traffic jam. So you wish you could fly to your destination in order to avoid spending the whole day on road. Your new vehicle <span class=SpellE>Aerocar</span> comes as the solution to you. With this car, you can fly from any point on the road (The <span class=SpellE>aerocar</span> has a vertical take-off &amp; landing similar to that of a helicopter) and land back to any point on the road any time. Now, though you would have liked to fly all the way and thus avoiding the traffic, you need to resist the temptation due to the fact that flying requires more fuel than driving. You need 1 unit of fuel to travel every unit distance along the path while F units per unit distance while flying. Now you need to write a program that, given the description of the road, can calculate the minimum possible fuel amount needed to complete your journey.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><a name=mhvd></a><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

font-family:Verdana'>A classical problem of number theory is Find the number of trailing zeroes in N<sup>M</sup>, in base B. This problem is quite conventional and easy. But a number can have same number of trailing zeroes in more than one base. For example, if decimal number 24 is written in 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 based number system, it will look like 80, 60, 40, 30, 20 and 10 respectively. So in all number systems it has only one trailing zero. Given a number N<sup>M</sup>, your job is to find out the number of integer bases in which it has exactly T trailing zeroes.&nbsp; </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=stylearial16pt><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Input</span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
