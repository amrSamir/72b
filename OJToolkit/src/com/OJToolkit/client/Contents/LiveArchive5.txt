Johnny and his friends have decided to spend Halloween night doing the usual
candy collection from the households of their village. As the village is too
big for a single group to collect the candy from all houses sequentially,
Johnny and his friends have decided to split up so that each of them goes to a
different house, collects the candy (or wreaks havoc if the residents don't
give out candy), and returns to a meeting point arranged in advance.

<P>
There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> houses in the village, the positions of which can be identified
with their Cartesian coordinates on the Euclidean plane. Johnny's gang is also
made up of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> people (including Johnny himself). They have decided to
distribute the candy after everybody comes back with their booty. The houses
might be far away, but Johnny's interest is in eating the candy as soon as
possible.

<P>
Keeping in mind that, because of their response to the hospitality of some
villagers, some children might be wanted by the local authorities, they have
agreed to fix the meeting point by the river running through the village, which
is the line <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I> = 0</SPAN>. Note that there may be houses on both sides of the river,
and some of the houses may be houseboats (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I> = 0</SPAN>). The walking speed of every
child is 1 meter per second, and they can move along any direction on the
plane.

<P>
At exactly midnight, each child will knock on the door of the house he has
chosen, collect the candy instantaneously, and walk back along the shortest
route to the meeting point.  Tell Johnny at what time he will be able to start
eating the candy.

Last night, Tom went on a date with a really nice girl. However, he forgot to
take his credit card with him and he had no cash in his wallet, so he ended up
working at the restaurant to pay for the bill. His task is to take plates from
the waiter when he comes from the tables, and pass them along when the
diswasher requests them. It is very important for the plates to be washed in
the same order as they are brought from the tables, as otherwise it could take
too long before a plate is washed, and leftover food might get stuck.  Trying
to hold all the plates in his hands is probably not a great idea, so Tom puts
them on a table as soon as the waiter hands them over to him, and picks them up
from the table again when the time comes to pass them along to the dishwasher.
There is space for only two piles of plates on the table, which will be
referred to as pile 1 and pile 2. There is only one table Tom can use.

<P>
Tom won last year's SWERC, so he is certainly capable of optimizing for
efficiency. You have to output a transcript of one possible way in which Tom
might decide to organize the plates on the table during the process, given the
sequence of plates and requests he receives.

<TT>DROP m</TT> or <TT>TAKE m</TT>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I> &gt; 0</SPAN> is the number of plates to
take or drop. <TT>DROP m</TT> represents that the next event is the waiter
bringing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> plates to Tom, one by one, so he has to drop them on the table; 
<TT>TAKE m</TT> represents that the next event is Tom taking <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> plates from
the table, one by one, and passing them along in the right order.  You can assume that he
never receives a <TT>TAKE m</TT> instruction when there are fewer than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>
plates on the table, and that the sum <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> of all values of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> corresponding to
<TT>DROP</TT> operations does not exceed <SPAN CLASS="MATH">100&nbsp;000</SPAN>.  Note that there might be
plates left on Tom's table when the last request is issued, as Tom might be
relieved of his duty to stay until the restaurant closes.

For every test case, the output will be a series of lines describing the
operations to be performed with the plates. The content of each line will be
one of the following:

You must output at most <SPAN CLASS="MATH">6<I>N</I></SPAN> lines, and the total number of movements of plates
in your transcript (that is, the sum of the <TT>m</TT>'s printed in your

the work.

<P>
Note that Tom must obey the commands in the same order as they are issued. This
means that, if he receives a TAKE <TT>m</TT> command, he must perform a certain
number of MOVE and TAKE operations such that the sum of the numbers of plates
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">taken</SPAN> adds up exactly to <TT>m</TT> before performing the operations
corresponding to the next command; and if he receives a <TT>DROP m</TT>
command, he must perform a number of DROP or MOVE operations for which the sum
of the numbers of plates <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">dropped</SPAN> adds up exactly to <TT>m</TT> before
performing the operations corresponding to the next command.

<P>
Of course, it is also forbidden to take plates from the waiter or pass them
along to the dishwasher in the absence of the corresponding order.

There <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">must</SPAN> be an empty line between the outputs of different cases.

Any solution satisfying these conditions will be accepted.

<P>John has <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> light bulbs and a switchboard with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> switches; each bulb can be either on or off, and pressing the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> -</SPAN>th switch changes the state of bulb <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> from on to off, and viceversa.

After a long week of work at the ICPC Headquarters, Bill and his friends
usually go to a small pub on Friday evenings to have a couple of beers and play
darts. All of them are well aware of the fact that their ability at darts
decreases at the same rate as the amount of beer left in their mugs.

<P>
They always play <SPAN CLASS="MATH">501</SPAN>, one of the easiest games. Players start with a score of
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> points (typically, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = 501</SPAN>, hence the name) and take turns throwing darts.
The score of each player decreases by the value of the section hit by the dart,
unless the score becomes negative, in which case it remains
unchanged.  The first player to reach a score of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">0</SPAN> wins. The figure below
shows the dartboard with which the game is played.

As the clock ticks closer to midnight and they start running out of beer,
everyone wonders the same: is it worth trying to aim the dart at a specific
section? Or is it better just to throw the dart at a random section on the
dartboard? You are asked to deal with the question by finding out what would
happen if two players (A and B) applying these two different strategies were to
play against each other:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Player A throws the darts at random, and consequently they land with
equal probability in each of the sections of the dartboard.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If Player B aims at a certain section, the dart has the same probability
of landing in the correct one as in each of the two adjacent ones (the
neighbouring regions to the left and right).  Moreover, he is completely aware
of his ability and sober enough to aim at the section that maximizes his
probability of winning.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Given the initial score of both players, can you determine the probability that
the first player wins? Of course, being the first to throw a dart might be
advantageous, so the answer depends on who plays first.

<P>A colony of alien bacteria has recently been discovered close to a crater in New Mexico. Dr. Poucher is in charge of the scientific team at the ICPC BioLab committed to the study of the alien DNA structure. We briefly sketch their discoveries here.<P>Alien DNA molecules have the structure of a circular sequence. Each sequence is composed of nucleotides. There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH">26</SPAN> different types of nucleotides, and each of them can occur in two faces. It is very important to remark that in any given alien DNA molecule, every nucleotide either does not appear at all or appears exactly twice (hence, the length of a DNA molecule is an even integer between <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">52</SPAN>). In case a nucleotide occurs twice, each occurrence can be of either type independently. Alien bacteria have two types of extremities, which in the technical biological jargon are referred to as arms and legs. A major discovery of Dr. Poucher's team is a method to determine the exact number of arms and legs of a bacterium by examining its DNA structure.<P>Here we represent each nucleotide as a letter of the alphabet. We refer to the different nucleotides as <TT>a</TT>, <TT>A</TT>, ...<TT>z</TT>, <TT>Z</TT>, where the lowercase and uppercase forms of a letter represent the two possible faces a nucleotide may appear with; we shall also use <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I>/<I>A</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I>/<I>B</I></SPAN>, ... <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I>/<I>Z</I></SPAN> to refer to a nucleotide in either face.<P>To determine the number of extremities, Dr. Poucher starts by initializing two counters of arms and legs to zero, and then proceeds to perform a number of surgeries, transforming a DNA sequence into another one. After each transformation, you may need to increase some of the counters, depending on the type of surgery applied. When the empty sequence of nucleotides (which will be denoted by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4508img1.png ALT="$ \emptyset$"></SPAN>) has been reached, the number of extremities of the original molecule has been found. The possible surgeries are:<P><OL><LI>Eliminate consecutive instances of a given nucleotide appearing with opposite faces. The number of arms and legs is preserved. For example: <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="59" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4508img1.png ALT="$ \tt aBbCaC$"> <IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4508img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"> <IMG WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4508img1.png ALT="$ \tt aCaC$"></SPAN> by eliminating <TT>Bb</TT>.

Tonight is Halloween and Scared John and his friends have decided to do
something fun to celebrate the occasion: crossing the graveyard. Although
Scared John does not find this fun at all, he finally agreed to join them in
their adventure. Once at the entrance, the friends have begun to cross the
graveyard one by one, and now it is the time for Scared John. He still
remembers the tales his grandmother told him when he was a child. She told him
that, on Halloween night, ``haunted holes'' appear in the graveyard. These are
not usual holes, but they transport people who fall inside to some point in the
graveyard, possibly far away. But the scariest feature of these holes is that
they allow one to travel in time as well as in space; i.e., if you fall inside
a ``haunted hole'', you appear somewhere in the graveyard a certain time before
(or after) you entered the hole, in a parallel universe otherwise identical to
ours.

<P>
The graveyard is organized as a grid of <!-- MATH
 $W \times H$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>H</I></SPAN> cells, with the entrance
in the cell at position <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(0, 0)</SPAN> and the exit at <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>W</I> - 1, <I>H</I> - 1)</SPAN>.  Despite the
darkness, Scared John can always recognize the exit, and he will leave the moment
he reaches it, determined never to set foot anywhere in the graveyard again.
On his way to the exit, he can walk from one cell to an adjacent one, and he
can only head to the North, East, South or West.  In each cell there can be either one
gravestone, one ``haunted hole'', or grass:

<UL>
<LI>If the cell contains a gravestone, you cannot walk over it, because gravestones are too high to climb.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If the cell contains a ``haunted hole'' and you reach it, you will
appear somewhere in the graveyard at a possibly different moment in time. The
time difference depends on the particular ``haunted hole'' you fell into, and
can be positive, negative or zero.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Otherwise, the cell has only grass, and you can walk freely over it.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
He is terrified, so he wants to cross the graveyard as quickly as possible. And
that is the reason why he has phoned you, a renowned programmer. He wants you
to write a program that, given the description of the graveyard, computes the
minimum time needed to go from the entrance to the exit. Scared John accepts
using ``haunted holes'' if they permit him to cross the graveyard quicker, but
he is frightened to death of the possibility of getting lost and being able to
travel back in time indefinitely using the holes, so your program must report
these situations.

<P>You work as an engineer for the <SPAN CLASS="textit">Inane Collaboration for Performance Computing</SPAN>, where you are in charge of designing an intercommunication network for their computers. The network is arranged as a rectangular array of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>n</I> - 1</SPAN> rows, each having <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<SUP>n-1</SUP></SPAN> switches. A switch is a device with two input wires, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>, and two output wires, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X'</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y'</I></SPAN>. If the switch is off, data from input <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> will be relayed to output <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X'</I></SPAN>, and data from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y'</I></SPAN>. If it is on, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> will be connected to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y'</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X'</I></SPAN>. Additionally, there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<SUP>n</SUP></SPAN> computers in the topmost and bottommost rows, and messages need to be sent between pairs of them. Notice that data from two different sources cannot share a wire but, of course, both pieces of data can be routed through the same switch on different inputs.<P>You have come to the conclusion that the network that best suits your purposes has the Bene&#353; topology. A <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1</SPAN>-Bene&#353; network is just a switch.

Dr.&nbsp;Ellie Arroway has established contact with an extraterrestrial
civilization. However, all efforts to decode their messages have failed so far
because, as luck would have it, they have stumbled upon a race of stuttering
aliens!  Her team has found out that, in every long enough message, the most
important words appear repeated a certain number of times as a sequence of
consecutive characters, even in the middle of other words. Furthermore,
sometimes they use contractions in an obscure manner.  For example, if they
need to say <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>bab</I></SPAN> twice, they might just send the message <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>babab</I></SPAN>, which has
been abbreviated because the second <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN> of the first word can be reused as the
first <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN> of the second one.

<P>
Thus, the message contains possibly overlapping repetitions of the same words
over and over again.  As a result, Ellie turns to you, S.R.&nbsp;Hadden, for help in
identifying the gist of the message.

<P>
Given an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>, and a string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>, representing the message, your task is
to find the longest substring of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> that appears at least <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> times. For
example, in the message <!-- MATH
 $baaaababababbababbab$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>baaaababababbababbab</I></SPAN>, the length-<SPAN CLASS="MATH">5</SPAN> word <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>babab</I></SPAN> is
contained <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3</SPAN> times, namely at positions <SPAN CLASS="MATH">5</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">7</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">12</SPAN> (where indices start
at zero). No substring appearing <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3</SPAN> or more times is longer (see the first
example from the sample input).  On the other hand, no substring appears <SPAN CLASS="MATH">11</SPAN>
times or more (see example <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2</SPAN>).

<P>
In case there are several solutions, the substring with the rightmost
occurrence is preferred (see example <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3</SPAN>).

<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input contains several test cases.  Each test case consists of a

 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

followed by a line containing a string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> of length between <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">40&nbsp;000</SPAN>,
inclusive. All characters in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> are lowercase characters from ``a'' to ``z''.
The last test case is denoted by
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I> = 0</SPAN> and must not be processed.

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
Print one line of output for each test case.  If there is no solution, output
<TT>none</TT>; otherwise, print two integers in a line, separated by a space.
The first integer denotes the maximum length of a substring appearing at least
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> times; the second integer gives the rightmost possible starting position of such a
substring.

<P>In UNIX<IMG WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="27" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4517img1.png ALT="\textregistered">-like operating systems, the <SPAN CLASS="textit">fork</SPAN> system call creates a new process (an independent executable object) that is uniquely identified by an integer ``process ID". This new process is a ``child" of its parent process (the process that executed the <SPAN CLASS="textit">fork</SPAN> system call). Of course, a child process could itself execute <SPAN CLASS="textit">fork</SPAN> and create its own children; there is no conceptual limit to the number of generations of processes that may exist, nor is there a limit on the number of child processes a parent may have (at least for this problem).<P>Another system call, <SPAN CLASS="textit">wait</SPAN> (in real systems there is a family of wait-like system calls; we consider only a single simple wait system call in this problem.), allows a parent process to delay its execution (if necessary) until it receives notice that one of its child processes has terminated. If a child process terminates before its parent calls <SPAN CLASS="textit">wait</SPAN>, then the child becomes a so-called <SPAN CLASS="textit">zombie</SPAN> process -- it continues to exist but does not actually execute; if the parent later calls <SPAN CLASS="textit">wait</SPAN> and at least one of its children has become a zombie, then the parent continues execution and the child process becomes completely terminated. If the parent should terminate before waiting for the termination of one or more of its children, then those remaining children become ``wards of the state" -- they are effectively adopted by a system process that spends it life repeatedly executing the <SPAN CLASS="textit">wait</SPAN> system call, efficiently ``reaping" terminated child processes that were abandoned by their parents. If a parent calls <SPAN CLASS="textit">wait</SPAN> and there are no child processes, the <SPAN CLASS="textit">wait</SPAN> call is effectively ignored and the parent continues execution. In this problem, a process terminates (or perhaps becomes a zombie) by executing the <SPAN CLASS="textit">exit</SPAN> system call. What we seek to find in this problem is the state of all processes after a sequence of fork, exit, and wait system calls has been executed.<P>We assume that there is initially only a single process, with a process ID of 1, running at the beginning of each case. It's ``parent" is the operating system, so when it exits, it is immediately ``reaped" by the system.<P>If there are multiple zombie children from which a parent could select when it executes <SPAN CLASS="textit">wait</SPAN>, then it selects the one with the smallest process ID.<P>Any zombie children of a parent are ``reaped" (that is, completely terminated) as soon as the parent executes the <SPAN CLASS="textit">exit</SPAN> system call.<P>When a process forks, the child process it creates is assigned the smallest positive process ID that has never been used.

<P>A binary operation on a set <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> is a mapping of every ordered pair of elements from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> to another element of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>. Addition of integers is such an operation, since the sum of every pair of integers is another integer. But division of integers is not a binary operation, since the result of some division operations is not an integer.<P>The word <SPAN CLASS="textit">ordered</SPAN> is important in the definition of a binary operation, since changing the order of the operands may well yield a different result. For example, in integer subtraction, the result of 1 - 2 is certainly not the same as 2 - 1. Binary operations for which the order of the operands is unimportant are called <SPAN CLASS="textit">commutative</SPAN>. That is, if for some operator `<code>@</code>' we have <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN> <code>@</code> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I> = <I>b</I></SPAN> <code>@</code> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN> for all possible values of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>, then the operator `<code>@</code>' is commutative.<P>The examples used above, integer addition and subtraction, are defined on infinite sets. But many operations are defined on sets with a finite number of elements. For example, logical operations like and, or, and exclusive or are defined on the set of logical values, false and true. In this problem we are concerned only with operators on finite sets.<P>A convenient way of documenting an operator is to enumerate the elements of the (finite) set on which it is defined, and to display a table showing the result of the operator. Each row and each column in this table is labeled with a set element, and the result of the operator is given in the body of the table.<P>For example, consider the logical and operator. The set of elements is, of course {false, true}, and the table might be displayed as follows:<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=3 BORDER FRAME=BOX RULES=GROUPS><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><TBODY><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>false</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>true</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>false</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>false</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>false</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>true</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>false</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>true</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P><P><BR>A binary operator `<code>@</code>' is said to be associative if, for all possible operands <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN> we have <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>a</I></SPAN> <code>@</code> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I>)</SPAN> <code>@</code> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I> = <I>a</I></SPAN> <code>@</code> <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>b</I></SPAN> <code>@</code> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I>)</SPAN>.

<P>An eastern European country called Beevaria is setting up a new jail. It is an unusual jail in that all of the cells are made with walls that are clear and unbreakable. The government wants to cut costs and, as such, has selected an unusual jail cell arrangement: each cell is a hexagon. The government has contracted with a construction firm to make these jails in various parts of the country using standardized materials. All that the construction firm needs to know is the size of the building, which the government specifies using the number of cells across the top.<P>Consider the figure below. The size of this jail is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I> = 3</SPAN>, consisting of 3 alternating pairs of rows starting with 3 hexagons and then 2 hexagons each, i.e. 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2. If the construction crew builds a jail of size <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I> = 2</SPAN>, the arrangement is 2, 1, 2, 1. For <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I> = 4</SPAN>, it is 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3. Each cell also has a number, as shown in the diagram. The numbering scheme matches the value for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>, of course, so that for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I> = 5</SPAN> the first row contains 0..4, the second contains 5..8, etc.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="456" HEIGHT="343" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/p4520.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4520.eps}"></DIV><P>Beevaria never has many criminals; jails are rarely full. In fact, a prison is never so full that the number of prisoners plus guards exceeds the number of cells. In the interests of saving money, the Beevaria government has opted to only supply a sufficient number of guards as needed to watch all of the prisoners. Since the walls are clear, this makes sense; if there is a prisoner in cell 13 and another in cell 14, only one guard is needed as long as the guard sits in cell 11. That guard can see both prisoners at the same time. Guards can only see into cells that are along a line of sight perpendicular to any of the six glass walls of the cell where they are located. For instance the guard in cell 11 can watch 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, and 14 but cannot watch 0, 2, 3, 4, 10 or 12.<P>Both a guard and a prisoner cannot occupy a cell: these prisoners may be dangerous criminals!<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Examples</SPAN><P>Here are some combinations to think about, using the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I> = 3</SPAN> diagram from above:<P><P><BR><TABLE COLS=5><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COL ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>Prisoners:</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>0, 1, 2</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>Guard position(s):</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>6</TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>1, 4, 5</TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>6, 11</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>(for example, also others)</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>9, 11, 13</TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>7</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>(note that the guard can see all three)</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>5, 6, 12, 13</TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>3</TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>0, 5, 9, 10, 12</TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>3, 8</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>(for example, also 3, 4, and others)</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>2, 4, 6, 8, 10</TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>1, 5, 7</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>(for example)</TD></TR></TABLE><P><P><BR>When presented with a value for prison size <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> and a set of cell numbers for prisoners, determine the <SPAN CLASS="textit">minimum number</SPAN> of guards that are needed to keep watch over all of the prisoners.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>There will be multiple prison descriptions in the input.

<P>No wonder Rome fell. Their numbering system was just messed up. Consider the number 4, which in Roman Numerals is ``<TT>IV</TT>". If I reverse the letters and make ``<TT>VI</TT>" I get 6.

Frugal Floors is in the business of selling and installing carpet and 
hardwood floors. Part of their job is to accurately determine the amount 
of material needed to cover the floor in a room. Because many rooms aren't 
simple rectangles, Frugal Floors employs a small robot to record the 
outline of the floor. Assuming the room is empty (or at least has all 
the furniture moved away from the walls), the robot starts at the 
intersection of two walls. It then moves along a wall, always staying 
in contact with a wall, recording its path, until it returns to the 
starting point. Frugal Floors - as part of being frugal -- always requires 
their customer's rooms to have square corners. Their employees are also 
careful to close the doors to the rooms being measured to avoid having 
their robot wander into other rooms! 

<P>
Once the robot completes its trip around the room's periphery, the data 
it recorded is downloaded to a computer and used to compute various items. 
In particular, the area of the floor is an important value. In this 
problem you will write a program that will compute that area from the 
robot's route. 

<P>
The route data is simple: it consists of a sequence of pairs (distance,
direction), where ``distance" is the distance the robot travels along a 
wall, and ``direction" is left or right, indicating the way the robot 
turned to continue along the next wall. Let's consider a few examples.

<P>

In the room on the left, the robot begins in the lower right corner and 
travels 20 feet, as indicated by the arrow. It then turns left and travels 
another 20 feet. It turns left again and travels 10 feet. After a right 
turn it travels 40 feet. Another left turn, 10 feet more, another left 
turn, and 60 feet more bring the robot back to its starting point. 

<P>
To illustrate the input data format, let's consider the robot's data 
for the room on the right. It will be this: 

<P>
<PRE>

</PRE>

<P>
The input is an integer giving the number of distance units (we use the 
foot as the unit of measurement in this problem, but the real robot can 
be configured to use much smaller units, like centimeters, for accuracy.)
the robot moved, a space, the letter <TT>L</TT> or <TT>R</TT>, a space, 
another integer distance, and so forth until the robot reaches its 
starting point, at which point it emits the letter <TT>X</TT> and the end 
of line (instead or <TT>L</TT> or <TT>R</TT>). 

<P>
The problem, of course, is to determine the area of the room measured 
by the robot. You are assured that the robot's data is correct, and that 
only real rooms with positive non-zero areas are being measured. You may 
also safely assume the area of each room is no greater than 100,000 square 
feet, and that no wall is longer than 1,000 feet.

Adjacent items are separated by exactly one space. The end of line

Frugal Floors (of problem 9 fame) wants to provide ``frugal" floorplans 
to their customers showing the layout of rooms. Being frugal, they have 
an inexpensive printer that can only print text characters with fixed 
widths (that is, it uses ``monospaced" fonts). It also has no facility 
for backspacing, doing ``reverse line feeds" (that is, moving the paper 
backward), or overprinting. But the printer can still display a simple 
text-mode approximation of a floorplan. 

<P>
They would like to employ exactly the same input data used in the program 
that calculates the area of a room (see problem 9 for details). At the 
intersection of each pair of walls, they want to display a plus sign 
(`<TT>+</TT>'). They want to display hyphens (`<TT>-</TT>') or vertical strokes (`<TT>|</TT>') for 
the walls, using whichever is appropriate. 

<P>
For a wall of length <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>, they want to use <!-- MATH
 $2 \times N + 1$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">2 <TT>x</TT> <I>N</I> + 1</SPAN> characters; 
two of these will be plus signs, and the remainder will be hyphens or 
vertical strokes. The only other characters that may ``appear" in the 
floorplan are spaces (blanks) and end of line characters. 

<P>
Consider a few examples. For a square room with 6-foot walls they want 
the diagram shown on the left below. And for a similar room with a 
1-foot square inset at the lower right corner, they want the diagram 
shown on the right.

Although these diagrams are correct, the vertical and horizontal sizes 
of a character cell on the printer differ, so the diagrams appear 
elongated. That's certainly expected. 

<P>
And since the robot that prepares the data could be started at the 
intersection of any pair of walls, and can move clockwise or 
counterclockwise around the room's periphery, the diagrams may be 
rotations or mirror images of those shown in these examples. You may be 
assured that this behavior is anticipated as well, and is acceptable. 

<P>
Although real printers have limitations on the widths of the lines they 
may display, Frugal apparently forgot this, and therefore didn't specify 
the scaling of floorplans that are wider than the printer. When such 
wide floorplans are printed, the long lines may wrap around or be 
truncated, but that's not your problem.

<P>By 2100, space travel will be a reality for the Milky Way (Solar Galaxy) residents. The Interstar Transport Travel agency operates scheduled direct space transports (flights) between some of the most popular planet destinations in the Milky Way. The cost of these scheduled direct transports are predetermined in Galaro (Galaxy Currency unit) and are published in many different languages. For travel to planets that is not on the schedule, there are slower, yet free, space flights from the closest planet that is on the direct transport list. To help travelers plan their itinerary, the Interstar Transport wants to offer a mobile application that can find the best traveling option, based on the total cost of the direct transports on the itinerary. Given the starting and destination planets on the itinerary, find the sequence of direct transports that has the lowest total traveling cost. Output all the planets in sequence that one must pass through on this best route.

<P>Dr. Wolf is an employee of Academic Cipher Machinery (ACM). His work is to secure a plenty of electronic documents by using a cipher machine invented by ACM. Given a document, the cipher machine is capable of making it encrypted whenever an arbitrary prime number, called the <SPAN CLASS="textit">key prime</SPAN>, is provided. In mathematics, a prime number is a positive integer which has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. Of course, an encrypted document can be decrypted if the corresponding key prime is available.<P>As a consequence, Dr. Wolf picked many key primes for those documents to be secured. This seems to be an easy task. However, Dr. Wolf found that it is very difficult for him to remember so many key primes. Therefore, he decided to write down some information of the key primes in a notebook. To ensure safety, only a <SPAN CLASS="textit">clue</SPAN> is recorded for each key prime. Let <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>0</SUB></SPAN> be a key prime. Dr. Wolf produces a clue <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>0</SUB></SPAN> according to the following strategy. Initially, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> is an empty sequence. In Step 1, select an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4525img1.png ALT="$ \ge$">1</SPAN> as well as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I> - 1</SPAN> prime numbers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>k</I><SUB>2</SUB>,..., <I>k</I><SUB>r-1</SUB></SPAN> that are not larger than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>0</SUB></SPAN>, and then include <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I></SPAN> into <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>. In Step 2, for each <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">0<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4525img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>i</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4525img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>r</I> - 1</SPAN>, either include <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> into <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>, or partition <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> into smaller positive integers (adding up to exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>) and then include the smaller integers into <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>. Finally, in Step 3, rearrange the integers in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> non-decreasingly. For example, a clue for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>0</SUB> = 13</SPAN> is made as follows. In Step 1, select <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I> = 4</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>k</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>k</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>k</I><SUB>3</SUB>) = (5, 5, 7)</SPAN>, and include 4 into <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>. In Step 2, partition <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>0</SUB> = 13</SPAN> into (2, 4, 7), partition <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>1</SUB> = 5</SPAN> into (1, 4), partition <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>2</SUB> = 5</SPAN> into (2, 3), and partition <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>3</SUB> = 7</SPAN> into (1, 1, 5). After Step 2, we have <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I> = (4, 2, 4, 7, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 5)</SPAN>. Finally, in Step 3, we obtain a clue <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I> = (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 7)</SPAN>.<P>Dr. Wolf would use clues to recover the original key primes. Unfortunately, Dr. Wolf found that there is a drawback in his strategy: the key prime that can be inferred from a given clue may not be unique! For example, consider the clue <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I> = (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 7)</SPAN>. We may conclude <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>0</SUB> = 13</SPAN> by letting <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I> = 4</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>k</I><SUB>0</SUB>, <I>k</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>k</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>k</I><SUB>3</SUB>) = (2 + 4 + 7, 1 + 4, 2 + 3, 1 + 1 + 5) = (13, 5, 5, 7)</SPAN>. However, we may also conclude <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>0</SUB> = 17</SPAN> by letting <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I> = 4</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>k</I><SUB>0</SUB>, <I>k</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>k</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>k</I><SUB>3</SUB>) = (2 + 4 + 7 + 4, 1 + 2, 3, 1 + 1 + 5) = (17, 3, 3, 7)</SPAN>, or conclude <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>0</SUB> = 29</SPAN> by letting <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I> = 2</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>k</I><SUB>0</SUB>, <I>k</I><SUB>1</SUB>) = (2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 7, 1 + 1 + 1) = (29, 3)</SPAN>. To overcome this drawback, Dr. Wolf calls a clue of a key prime <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>0</SUB></SPAN> good if the largest key prime that can be inferred from it is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>0</SUB></SPAN>. In the above example, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I> = (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 7)</SPAN> is good if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I><SUB>0</SUB> = 29</SPAN>. In order to produce good clues, Dr. Wolf needs a program that computes the largest key prime that can be inferred from a given clue.

<P>A factory produces products as follows. There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> days in the coming production season. Each morning the factory orders materials. At noon the materials will arrive and shipped into a warehouse. In the afternoon the factory produces products using the material in the warehouse. There is only one kind of material and one kind of product, and one unit of materials can make one unit of product. The factory needs to produce exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> products on the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>-th day of the production season, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> is between 1 and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>. Also if the factory does not use all the materials in the warehouse, it can use them later, but the material can only be stored in the warehouse for up to 2 days, after that they cannot be used to make products.

<P>To prepare for the flu pandemic, country E wants to set up some vaccination centers. There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> regions in the country, numbered <SPAN CLASS="MATH">0, 1, 2,..., <I>n</I> - 1</SPAN>. The costs associated with the vaccination plan are the set up cost and the administration cost. The set up cost, namely <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>, is the expense to build a vaccination center at region <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>, for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> = 0</SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> - 1</SPAN>. The administration cost mainly consists of the transportation cost for people to travel to nearby regions if no center established in their own region. It is certainly a difficult task to find out the set up costs and administration costs. Fortunately, the transportation bureau and the center for disease control have those numbers. Their investigation determined that the administration cost is a function of the distance from one region to the region where the closest vaccination center resides. More specifically, if there is no vaccination center in region <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> and region <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN> is the nearest region of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> with a vaccination center, the administration cost of region <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> would be the length of the shortest path from region <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> to region <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN>. It is clear that the administration cost for a region with a vaccination center will be zero. Since E is famous for its efficiency, their transportation system connects all the regions. However, the structure of the road system is a tree. That is, there is only one route from one region to another. Now, the authority has decided that the number of vaccination centers must be smaller or equal to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>. Once a set of regions <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN> has been decided as the vaccination centers, the total set up cost will be the sum of the set up cost for each chosen region; the total administration cost will be the summation of the administration costs of all regions, and the total cost will be the sum of the total set up cost and the total administration cost. You are to write a program to select at most <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> vaccination centers so that the total cost is minimized.<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Technical Specification</SPAN><OL><LI><SPAN CLASS="MATH">3<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4527img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>n</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4527img1.png ALT="$ \le$">30</SPAN>. </LI><LI><!-- MATH

<P>In a factory, there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> pairs of jobs, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>p</I><SUB>i</SUB>, <I>q</I><SUB>i</SUB>)</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> = 1, 2,..., <I>n</I></SPAN>, to be scheduled.

One day, Happyland is struck by a typhoon and the electrical power system is destroyed.<P>The mayor of Happyland has a mobile nuclear power generator that can provide electricity to all of the house in the island. The power generator can be placed at any place in the Happyland. Each family has a power cord of length <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>l</I></SPAN>.

<P><SPAN CLASS="textit">All Cool Movie</SPAN> (ACM) is a company that runs a website with many movie DVDs for online rental service. A user who subscribes to the service not only can rent DVDs by a few online clicks, but also can rate the movies that she has seen using ranks of <TT>one-star</TT>, <TT>two-star</TT>, <TT>three-star</TT>, <TT>four-star</TT>, or <TT>five-star</TT>. <TT>One-star</TT> means that the user absolutely hates the movie, and <TT>five-star</TT> means that the user likes it very much. ACM's success is based on a simple but robust model that predicts the users' preferences on unseen movies. In particular, the company uses the ratings that were gathered to predict the users' preferences on unseen movies.<P>ACM's model is as follows. Assume that there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>U</I></SPAN> users and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> movies in the system, and user <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> rates movie <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN> as rank <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I><SUB>i, j</SUB></SPAN>. ACM tries to decompose the rank into two factors: the user factor <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>u</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> and the movie factor <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I><SUB>j</SUB></SPAN>. In other words, it seeks to find a real value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>u</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> and a real value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I><SUB>j</SUB></SPAN> such that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4531img1.png ALT="$ \hat{{r}}_{{i,j}}^{}$"> = <I>u</I><SUB>i</SUB> + <I>m</I><SUB>j</SUB> <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4531img1.png ALT="$ \approx$"> <I>r</I><SUB>i, j</SUB></SPAN>. For calibration, there is assumed to be a pseudo user 0 with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>u</I><SUB>0</SUB> = 0</SPAN> that rates every movie as rank 3 (i.e., <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I><SUB>0, j</SUB> = 3</SPAN> for all <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4531img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>j</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4531img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>M</I></SPAN>). There is also a pseudo movie 0 with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I><SUB>0</SUB> = 0</SPAN> that gets rank 3 from every user (i.e., <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I><SUB>i, 0</SUB> = 3</SPAN> for all <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4531img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>i</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4531img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>U</I></SPAN>).<P>After gathering <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> tuples of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>i</I>, <I>j</I>, <I>r</I><SUB>i, j</SUB>)</SPAN> pairs from the users, ACM then determines the optimal values of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>u</I><SUB>1</SUB>,<SUP> ... </SUP>, <I>u</I><SUB>i</SUB>,<SUP> ... </SUP>, <I>u</I><SUB>U</SUB>)</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>m</I><SUB>1</SUB>,<SUP> ... </SUP>, <I>m</I><SUB>j</SUB>,<SUP> ... </SUP>, <I>m</I><SUB>M</SUB>)</SPAN> by minimizing the sum of squared error <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I><SUB>i, j</SUB> - <IMG WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4531img1.png ALT="$ \hat{{r}}_{{i,j}}^{}$">)<SUP>2</SUP></SPAN> over all the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> tuples, the ranks from pseudo user 0 and the ranks for pseudo movie 0.<P>Because of the success in business, ACM decides to run a promotion as a thank-you gesture to its users. During the promotion period, each user would be freely awarded with one movie--no more, no less--that she/he has not rated (which is taken to mean that she/he has not seen the movie). Of course, ACM doesn't have many DVDs for each movie, and thus can  only give the same movie to at most two different users.

<P>A young magician, David Jr., just learned an <SPAN CLASS="textit">Ancient Cord Magic</SPAN> (ACM) that he can teleport a number of objects at a time to anywhere as he wishes. However, since David Jr. is not proficient in ACM yet, he still needs to use the tool, called <SPAN CLASS="textit">Magic Rope</SPAN>, to surround the objects, and all the objects enclosed by the magic rope will be teleported together in an attempt.<P>David Jr. can teleport four objects at most at a time. David Jr. is liked by everyone because of his special skill of ACM. For example, he is very helpful when his friends are moving in/out the student dorm every year. However, David Jr. sets some rules as follows.<P><P><BR><OL><LI>His friends need to pay him the moving cost, which is measured by the length of the <SPAN CLASS="textit">Magic Rope</SPAN> used in teleporting. </LI><LI>To save his friends' money, David Jr. will always move four objects at a time. Moreover, he will always use as least length of the magic rope as possible to surround the four objects (i.e., forming a quadrangle, which might be convex or concave, with the minimum circumference) in each teleporting. </LI><LI>If there are two groups of objects (four objects in each group) that can be surrounded by the least length of the magic rope, David Jr. will teleport the group that has the smallest X-coordinate value among the <SPAN CLASS="textit">distinct</SPAN> objects of the two groups, i.e., the objects that belong to exact one (but not both) of the two groups. </LI><LI>Every time after David Jr. finishes one round of teleporting, he will make the decision of the next four objects to be teleported, based on the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> coordinate values of the rest objects. </LI></OL><P><P><BR>For example, there are eight objects on the plane, and their coordinates are (3.02, 2.02), (3.03, 2.03), (3.075, 2.025), (3.055, 2.005), (3.025, 2.075), (3.005, 2.055), (3.095, 2.017) and (3.123, 2.048) respectively. In the first round, David Jr. has two candidate groups of objects to teleport: the first group is (3.02, 2.02), (3.03, 2.03), (3.075, 2.025), and (3.055, 2.005); and the second group is (3.02, 2.02), (3.03, 2.03), (3.025, 2.075), and (3.005, 2.055). Both groups can be surrounding by a magic rope of the cord length 0.1258. However, since there are only four distinct objects in the two groups, i.e., (3.075, 2.025), (3.055, 2.005), (3.025, 2.075), and (3.005, 2.055), and the second group has the object (3.005, 2.055) which has the smallest X-coordinate value among the four distinct objects, David Jr. will teleport the second group in the first round. Then, he will teleport the remaining objects in the second round (cord length is 0.1650). The total length of the magic rope used is 0.1258 + 0.1650 = 0.2908.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="771" HEIGHT="425" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/p4532.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4532.eps}"></DIV><P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Technical Specification</SPAN><OL><LI>There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH">4<I>N</I></SPAN> objects. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> is an integer, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/p4532.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>N</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/p4532.png ALT="$ \le$">50</SPAN>. </LI><LI>The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I>, <I>Y</I></SPAN> coordinates of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>-th object is <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>X</I><SUB>i</SUB>, <I>Y</I><SUB>i</SUB>)</SPAN>. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> are positive real numbers; moreover, <!-- MATH

<P>Challenge 24 is a popular mathematics game used in many grade schools. In each game, contestants are given a card with four positive integers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>i</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>i</I><SUB>3</SUB>, <I>i</I><SUB>4</SUB></SPAN> on it, and the first one who can use all of these numbers and any combination of the four basic arithmetic operations to get 24 wins. Each of the numbers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>i</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>i</I><SUB>3</SUB>, <I>i</I><SUB>4</SUB></SPAN> must be used exactly once. Division can be used only if the divisor evenly divides the dividend (i.e., you can perform 6/2 but not 6/4). For example, if the card contains the numbers 7, 2, 5 and 1, possible solutions are <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(7 - 2) <TT>*</TT> 5 - 1</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(7 + 1) <TT>*</TT> (5 - 2)</SPAN>. Hmmm <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN> this sounds like a source of a good programming problem.<P>Write a program that determines the longest consecutive sequence of integers that can be obtained by different ways of arithmetically combining the four integers.

<P>
``The Price is Right" is a popular game show where contestants play 
various games to win fabulous prizes. One of the games played on the 
show is called ``Cover Up" whose object is to guess a 5-digit number 
(actually, the price of a new car). In the actual game, contestants 
are given two numbers to choose from for the first digit, three 
numbers to choose from for the second digit, and so on. A contestant 
selects one number for each digit (from the set of yet unpicked numbers 
for that digit) and then is told which ones are correct; if at least 
one is correct, the player is allowed to guess again for all incorrect 
digits. The contestant keeps guessing as long as they keep getting at 
least one new digit correct. The game ends when either all the digits 
are correct (a win for the contestant) or after a turn when no new digit 
is guessed correctly (a loss). 

<P>
Typically this game is not sheer luck. For example, suppose you had the 
following five possibilities for the last digit: 1, 3, 5, 8 and 9. Many 
car prices end with either a 5 or a 9, so you might have, say, a 70% 
chance that one of these two numbers is correct; this breaks down to a 
35% chance for either the 5 or the 9 and a 10% chance for each of the 
other three digits. Now say you pick the 5 and it's wrong, but some 
other guess you made was right so you still get to play. With this 
additional information the probabilities for the remaining 4 numbers 
change: the probability for the 9 is now close to around 54%, while 
each of the other three numbers now has a little over a 15% chance. 
(We'll let you figure out how we got these values). We'll call the 5 
and the 9 in the original group the known candidates, and typically 
there are known candidates in other columns as well. For example, if 
the two numbers for the first (high order) digit are 1 and 9, the 
contestant can be 100% sure that the 1 is the correct digit (there 
aren't too many $90,000 cars to be given away). 

<P>
For this problem, you are to determine the probability of winning the
game if an optimal strategy for picking the numbers (based on 
probabilities such as those described above) is used.

<P>One well known method to compress image files is the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) encoding, created by CompuServe in 1987. Here's a simplified version applied to strings of alphabetic characters. Essential for this compression is a dictionary which assigns numeric encodings (we'll use base 10 numbers for this problem) to different strings of characters. The dictionary is initialized with mappings for characters or substrings which may appear in the string. For example, if we expect to encounter all 26 letters of the alphabet, the dictionary will initially store the encodings <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>A</I>, 00),(<I>B</I>, 01),(<I>C</I>, 02),...,(<I>Z</I>, 25)</SPAN>.

<P>Little Bobby Roberts (son of Big Bob, of Problem G) plays this solitaire memory game called Flipper. He starts with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> cards, numbered 1 through <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>, and lays them out in a row with the cards in order left-to-right. (Card 1 is on the far left; card <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> is on the far right.) Some cards are face up and some are face down. Bobby then performs <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> - 1</SPAN> flips -- either right flips or left flips. In a right flip he takes the pile to the far right and flips it over onto the card to its immediate left. For example, if the rightmost pile has cards A, B, C (from top to bottom) and card D is to the immediate left, then flipping the pile over onto card D would result in a pile of 4 cards: C, B, A, D (from top to bottom). A left flip is analogous.<P>The very last flip performed will result in one pile of cards - some face up, some face down. For example, suppose Bobby deals out 5 cards (numbered 1 through 5) with cards 1 through 3 initially face up and cards 4 and 5 initially face down. If Bobby performs 2 right flips, then 2 left flips, the pile will be (from top to bottom) a face down 2, a face up 1, a face up 4, a face down 5, and a face up 3.<P>Now Bobby is very sharp and you can ask him what card is in any position and he can tell you!!! You will write a program that matches Bobby's amazing feat.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Each test case will consist of 4 lines.

<P>Bob Roberts (father of Little Bobby of problem D) works at the Traffic Commission for a medium size town. Bob is in charge of monitoring the traffic lights in the city and dispatching repair crews when necessary. Needless to say, Bob has a lot of free time, so to while away the hours he tries to figure out the quickest way to take short trips between various points in the city. Bob has at his disposal a lot of information: the layout of streets in the city and the location and cycle times for all of the traffic lights. To simplify the solution process, he makes the following assumptions:<P><P><BR><OL><LI>All cars travel at the same top speed, and, if sitting at a red light, take 5 seconds to react and get up to speed. (That is, Bob assumes the car is essentially standing still for 5 seconds, then proceeds at top speed. Bob also assumes the light will not have turned back to red in the 5 seconds it takes to get going.) </LI><LI>Each car approaches a light at full speed and either passes through the light if it is green or yellow, or comes to an immediate stop if it is red. Cars are allowed to pass through a light if they hit it just as it is turning to green. Cars must stop if they reach the light just as it is turning to red. </LI><LI>The time to make turns through a light is ignored. It is possible to travel between any two lights, although perhaps not directly. Even given these assumptions, Bob has difficulty coming up with minimum time paths. Let's see if you can help him. </LI></OL><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The first line of each test case will contain four positive integers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>e</I></SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(2<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4539img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>n</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4539img1.png ALT="$ \le$">100)</SPAN> is the number of traffic lights (numbered 0 through <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> - 1</SPAN>), <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> is the number of roads between the traffic lights, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>e</I></SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>s</I> <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/4539img1.png ALT="$ \neq$"> <I>e</I>)</SPAN> are the starting and ending lights for the desired trip.

Usually the path in a maze is calculated as the sum of steps taken from the 
starting point until the ending point, assuming that the distance of one step 
is exactly 1. Lets assume that we could ``stretch" (shorten or extend) the maze 
in vertical dimension (north-south). By stretching, we are just changing the 
passed distance between two cells. (it becomes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> instead of one). We have a 
two dimensional maze which has `<TT>#</TT>' for walls, `<TT>S</TT>' in the 
starting cell and `<TT>E</TT>' at the ending cell. 

<P>
Due to outside conditions, we need to make the shortest path to be exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> 
in size. 

<P>
We are not allowed to change the maze configuration, nor to make any 
changes in the horizontal dimension. We are only allowed to stretch the 
vertical dimension, and that can be done by any percentage. 

<P>
Find the percentage of the stretch <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>, for which the shortest path of the maze 
will be exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN>.

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Explanation of the first test case in the example:</SPAN> On the original maze, 
the length of the shortest path is 3 because there are two horizontal steps and a 
vertical one. Our goal is to make the length of the shortest path to be 2.5. That's 
why we have to ``stretch" the vertical dimension of the maze by a percentage value 
less than 100. In this case it is 50% which actually changes the vertical distance 
between two cells to 0.5.

<P>Making revolutions in the software industry is not an easy task. That's why this problem is about something else. Stanescu has just invented a new super-cool way to develop software. It is similar to writing program code, but instead of writing it, you ask some else to do it. In such way, one could create great software, without even knowing what a Turing Machine is. As you can see, this is not just software industry revolution. Really, Stanescu does not care about the software industry at all.

<P>John and Brus are playing a military strategic game on a PC. The game is played on the flat world map. At the beginning of the game Brus places his army. Then John has to choose strategic points for his army according to the following rules:<P><UL><LI>each strategic point must be a lattice point <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>)</SPAN> (a lattice point is a point with integer coordinates) such that <!-- MATH

<P>John and Brus believe that number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> is a very bad number. Thus they try to avoid it every time and everywhere.<P>Now the guys would like to represent number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> as a sum of positive numbers, each of which not exceeding <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>. But don't forget about the bad number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I>!</SPAN> Each summand must not be divisible by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>, moreover the number of summands also must not be divisible by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>.<P>Your task is to find the minimal possible number of summands in such representation of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>.<P>For example, if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = 3</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I> = 11</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I> = 6</SPAN> then we can represent <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> as 5+6, but as far as 6 is divisible by 3 we must have at least 3 summands. But as far as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = 3</SPAN> we can't have 3 summands and thus the answer is 4.

<P>
Some automobiles display the estimated driving range, that is, the distance you can expect 
to drive it (without adding fuel) before running out of fuel. Here is how it works: 
periodically, the vehicle's computer records the odometer reading and the weight of 
fuel in the fuel tank. From this data, the fuel consumption over a certain distance can 
be computed. From the fuel consumption and the most recent measurement of fuel tank 
contents (which we assume is current for all practical purposes), the range can be calculated.

<P>
Intervals over which the quantity of fuel increased (fuel was added to the tank) will not be 
used in the computations. For example, in the first problem instance of the sample input, 
the interval where the fuel weight increased from 29.9 kilograms to 34.2 kilograms will not 
be used. In this example, 16.3 kilograms of fuel were consumed over a distance of 228.6 
kilometers. Therefore, the most recently measured fuel contents of 31.2 kilograms will 
enable you to drive another 438 kilometers (rounded to the nearest integer). The input 
will always contain at least one interval (two consecutive lines of input) where no fuel 
was added to the tank.

</H2>

<P>
The input contains data for a number of problem instances. Each problem instance consists 
of three or more (odometer reading, fuel weight) pairs, one pair per line. Distances are 
measured in kilometers and fuel weight in kilograms. All input numbers will be given to 
one decimal place.

<P>
The end of each problem instance will be signaled by a (0.0, 0.0) pair. The last problem 
instance will be followed by a (-1.0, -1.0) pair.

<P>A cell phone user is travelling along a line segment with end points having integer coordinates. In order for the user to have cell phone coverage, it must be within the transmission radius of some transmission tower.

<P>Clickomania is a puzzle in which one starts with a rectangular grid of cells of different colours. In each step, a player selects (``clicks") a cell. All connected cells of the same colour as the selected cell (including itself) are removed if the selected cell is connected to at least one other cell of the same colour. The resulting ``hole" is filled in by adjacent cells based on some rule, and the object of the game is to remove all cells in the grid.<P>In this problem, we are interested in the one-dimensional version of the problem. The starting point of the puzzle is a string of colours (each represented by an uppercase letter). At any point, one may select (click) a letter provided that the same letter occurs before or after the one selected. The substring of the same letter containing the selected letter is removed, and the string is shortened to remove the hole created. To solve the puzzle, the player has to remove all letters and obtain the empty string. If the player obtains a non-empty string in which no letter can be selected, then the player loses.<P>For example, if one starts with the string `<TT>ABBAABBAAB</TT>', selecting the first ``B" gives `<TT>AAABBAAB</TT>'. Next, selecting the last `<TT>A</TT>' gives `<TT>AAABBB</TT>'. Selecting an `<TT>A</TT>' followed by a `<TT>B</TT>' gives the empty string. On the other hand, if one selects the third `<TT>B</TT>' first, the string `<TT>ABBAAAAB</TT>' is obtained. One may verify that regardless of the next selections, we obtain either the string `<TT>A</TT>' or the string `<TT>B</TT>' in which no letter can be selected. Thus, one must be careful in the sequence of selections chosen in order to solve a puzzle. Furthermore, there are some puzzles that cannot be solved regardless of the choice of selections. For example, `<TT>ABBAAAAB</TT>' is not a solvable puzzle.<P>Some facts are known about solvable puzzles:<P><UL><LI>The empty string is solvable. </LI><LI>If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> are solvable puzzles, so are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>xy</I></SPAN>, <TT>A</TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN><TT>A</TT>, and <TT>A</TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN><TT>A</TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN><TT>A</TT> for any uppercase letter <TT>A</TT>. </LI><LI>All other puzzles not covered by the rules above are unsolvable. </LI></UL><P>Given a puzzle, your task is to determine whether it can be solved or not.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Each case of input is specified by a single line.

<P>An investor invests a certain percentage of his assets into <TT>NINSTRUMENTS</TT> financial instruments. After each term, these instruments deduct a certain fixed administrative cost, followed by a fee that is a percentage of the amount that was invested at the beginning of the term, and then add a return, which is a (positive or negative) percentage of the amount invested at the beginning of the term. If any account drops to zero or below after such a transaction, it is considered closed (no fees are charged against it, and is treated as simply zero) until a rebalancing occurs.<P>Rebalancing occurs after every <TT>NREBALANCE</TT> terms, where the total assets of the investor are redistributed according to the original ratios for the instruments. Without rebalancing, the investor's assets would become dominated by the higher return instruments, which would expose them to more risk compared to a balanced investment plan. Note that it is possible that all instruments drop to zero, in which case they all remain closed for the remaining terms.<P>You are to model the value of such an investment strategy and report the ending value in each instrument (before rebalancing, if it happens to land on a term when a rebalance is due).

<P>Every electrical appliance (such as a light bulb) has a certain resistance. If the appliance is connected to a given voltage, the higher its resistance, the lower the current flowing through the appliance. The unit of measurement for resistance is the ohm. In order to avoid round-off errors that can affect floating-point numbers, we will use rational numbers (quotients of positive integers) to represent the resistance of an appliance numerically.<P>There are two basic ways to connect two or more appliances into a configuration of appliances: serially (Figure 1) or parallel (Figure 2).<P>Two or more configurations can be further connected serially or parallel to yield another (more complex) configuration yet, and this process of building more complex configurations from existing ones can be repeated any number of times (Figure 3).<P>In general, a configuration is either a single appliance, or a serial connection of two or more configurations, or a parallel connection of two or more configurations.<P>The resistance of a configuration of resistors can be computed according to the following two rules:<OL><LI>The resistance of a serial configuration is the sum of the resistances of its component configurations. </LI><LI>The resistance of a parallel configuration is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of its component configurations. </LI></OL><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="907" HEIGHT="345" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/p4566a.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p4566a.eps}"></DIV><P>In Figure 1, the resistance of the configuration is 3/2 + 3/4 + 1/4 = 5/2 ohm.<P>Figure 2, the resistance of the configuration is 1/(1/(3/2) + 1/(1/2) + 1/ (1/4)) = 3/20 ohm<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="792" HEIGHT="383" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/p4566a.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p4566b.eps}"></DIV><P>In Figure 3, we first calculate 1/(1/(1/2) + 1/(2/3)) + 2/5 = 24/35 and 1/2 + 1/(1/(2/3) + 1/(2/5)) + 3/2 = 9/4.

<P>A casino owns an expensive card shuffling machine which may shuffle up to 520 cards at a time (there are 52 cards in each deck). For convenience, we will simply label the cards <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1, 2, 3,..., <I>N</I></SPAN> where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> is the total number of cards, and copies of the same card (e.g. Ace of Spades) from different decks are considered different. Unfortunately, the card shuffling machine is defective, and it always shuffles the cards the same way. The company that produces these machines is out of business because of the economic downturn. There is no one who can fix the machine, and a new machine is too expensive.<P>Being a brilliant employee of the casino, you realized that all is not lost. You can shuffle the cards differently simply by using the machine zero or more times. For example, suppose that the machine shuffles the cards 1, 2, 3, 4 into the order 2, 3, 4, 1. If you put the cards into the machine, take the shuffled cards out and insert them into the machine again (without changing the order), you will get the order 3, 4, 1, 2. That way, it is possible to shuffle the cards in many different ways even though it may take longer. But this is not a significant issue since decks do not have to be reshuffled often, and used decks can be shuffled while other decks are being used to avoid any waiting time.<P>Unfortunately, not all shufflings can be produced in this way in general, and you wish to know if this procedure ``stack the decks" in a favorable way for the casino or the player. As a first step, you wish to know which shufflings are possible to produce, and how many times you need to use the machine on the deck in order to produce the shuffling.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input for each case consists of three lines.

The second line consists of the integers <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1, 2,..., <I>N</I></SPAN> listed in some order and separated by a space. The list gives the order of the shuffling performed by the machine when the input cards are ordered <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1, 2,..., <I>N</I></SPAN>. The third line is in the same format as the second line, and gives the shuffling we wish to obtain.

<P>This problem is based on a children's game, Chutes and Ladders, where players take turns jumping a number of steps along a path. If they land on the base of a ladder, they rise to the top of the ladder in the same turn. If they land at the top of a chute, they slide down to the bottom in the same turn. The idea is to get to the final step on the path. In the children's game the number of steps to move in a turn is determined randomly, so the game requires no decisions. In the version here, Up and Down, players get to choose the number of steps to jump forward in each turn. Both figures above show spaces numbered from 0 to 28, with several chutes and ladders. They show two different possible sequences of moves, assuming jumps of 1, 2 or 3 are allowed. Each jump is illustrated starting at a gray dot and ending at an arrowhead, jumping 1-3 places ahead, sometimes ending there, and sometimes shifting up a ladder or down a chute. The players in Figures 1 and 2 finish in 5 and 4 turns respectively. Figure 2 demonstrates the minimum number of turns for this path configuration and a maximum jump of 3.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="1269" HEIGHT="604" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/p4570.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4570.eps}"></DIV><P>It gets harder a figure out the best path if there are more chutes and ladders and many more spaces along the path!

<P>
In Windows, a DLL (or dynamic link library) is a file that contains a collection of 
pre-compiled functions that can be loaded into a program at runtime. The two primary 
benefits of DLLs are (1) only one copy of a DLL is needed in memory, regardless of how 
many different programs are using it at the same time, and (2) since they are separate 
from programs, DLLs can be upgraded independently, without having to recompile the 
programs that use them. (DLLs have their problems, too, but we'll ignore those for now.) 
Your job is to calculate the maximum memory usage when running a series of programs 
together with the DLLs they need. 

<P>
The DLLs in our system are not very exciting. These dull DLLs (or DuLLs) each require a 
fixed amount of memory which never changes as long as the DuLL is in memory. Similarly, 
each program has its own fixed memory requirements which never change as long as the 
program is executing. Each program also requires certain DuLLs to be in memory the entire 
time the program is executing. Therefore, the only time the amount of memory required 
changes is when a new program is executed, or a currently running program exits. When a 
new program begins execution, all DuLLs required by that program that must be loaded into 
memory if they are not there already. When a currently running program exits, all DuLLs 
that are no longer needed by any currently running programs are removed from memory. 

<P>
Remember, there will never be more than one copy of a specific DuLL in memory at any given 
time. However, it is possible for multiple instances of the same program to be running at 
the same time. In this case each instance of the program would require its own memory; 
however, the instances still share DuLLs in the same way two unrelated programs would.

This problem is based on the game of Black Vienna. In this version there are three players 
and 18 cards labeled A-R. Three of the cards are set aside (hidden) and form the ``Black 
Vienna" gang. The remaining cards are shuffled and dealt to the players so that each player 
has 5 cards. Players never reveal their cards to each other. There is a separate deck of 
``interrogation cards" which contain three distinct letters in ascending order, like ACG 
or BHR. Turns rotate through players 1, 2, and 3. On each player's turn, that player 
selects an interrogation card, puts it face up in front of another player, and that 
other player must indicate the total number of these cards being held, without saying 
which ones. All players see the result of the ``interrogation". The play continues until 
a player deduces the three cards in the ``gang". 

<P>
For example, suppose the cards are distributed as follows, and the game then proceeds:

In fact, the game does not need to get to turn 9. With enough thought, player 1 can deduce 
after turn 8 that the gang is BIK. It is your job to analyse records of games and deduce 
the earliest time that the gang could be determined for sure.

<P>Roman numerals use symbols I, V, X, L, C, D, and M with values 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 respectively.

<P>Cell phones generally provide service by connecting to a nearby cellular tower. At any given time there may be several towers in range. The cell phone, however, will only connect to the one with the best signal strength. The purpose of this problem is to track a traveler carrying a cell phone. At each mile marker along a road, note which tower the cell phone is using, and report when it is different from the previous marker.<P>The position of towers will be specified as X-Y coordinates in miles relative to some arbitrary origin. The traveler will travel down a road composed of straight line segments laid end to end. The road will not intersect itself. Assume that there are markers occurring every mile along the road, with mile marker zero being at the starting point. If the road ends at least 0.5 miles past the last mile marker, the end of the road is labeled with the next mile. For instance if the road is 8.6 miles long, the endpoint is labeled as mile 9. If the road is 8.2 miles long, regular mile marker 8 is the last.<P>If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN> is the distance to a tower with power <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>, the signal strength for the tower will be calculated as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I>/<I>d</I><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="textbf">rounded</SPAN> to the nearest integer. A tower will never be placed at the position of a mile marker.<P>Consider the examples shown in the Figures below. Each shows a road and labeled mile markers and cell towers.<P>In Figure 1, where the segments of the road all follow the background grid, mile markers come at intersections in the grid. The cell towers A and B are at (1, 4) and (5, 4). Both have power 1,000. At mile markers 0 and 1 the strength of A is greater. At mile markers 2 - 4 the strength of A and B are equal. In such cases you are to note the cell tower with the label closer to the <SPAN CLASS="textit">beginning</SPAN> of the alphabet, so it continues to be A. At mile markers 5 - 9 B is stronger. At mile 10 the towers are of equal strength, but the one with first letter is reported, A. Tower A remains strongest to the end. The long crossbars show the mile markers where the reported strongest tower is different than at the previous marker.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="1110" HEIGHT="420" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/p4577.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4577.eps}"></DIV><P><P><BR>The example in Figure 2 has three towers: A at (0, 0) and C at (6, 6), both with power 1,000, while tower B at (6, 0) has a power of 600.

Initially tower A is the strongest. Tower C is strongest at mile markers 3 - 8. The end of the road at (5, 2) is more than a half mile from mile 8, so it is labeled as mile 9. At the endpoint, B is strongest, unlike at mile 8, so a report is made for the endpoint.<P>Figure 3 is similar to Figure 2, except it shifts the beginning of the road and changes the power of cell tower B to 300. Tower A starts as the strongest, and then at mile markers 2 - 7 tower C is strongest.

<P>
Business has been slow at Gleamin' Lemon Used Auto Sales. In an effort to bring in new 
customers, management has created the Rebate Incentive Program Of Fabulous Fun (or RIPOFF). 
This is a simple game which allows customers to try and win a rebate on an automobile 
purchase. The RIPOFF game is a board game where each square is labeled with a rebate 
amount. The customer advances through the board by spinning a spinner. Each square he 
lands on adds to his total rebate amount. When he reaches the end of the board he is 
rewarded with the total rebate amount. 

<P>
Of course, given the company involved, it should come as no surprise that there are a 
couple of catches written in the fine print. The first is that there is a limit to the 
number of turns the customer has to finish the game; if he doesn't reach the end within 
the allotted number of turns then he loses his rebate. The second is that some of the 
squares actually have a negative amount which subtract from the rebate instead of 
adding to it. A particularly unlucky customer might even come out of the game with a 
negative rebate. 

<P>
Even with these catches, the management of Gleamin' Lemon is concerned that someone might 
win a particularly large rebate -- something they would like to avoid at all costs. Your 
job is to take a particular configuration for the RIPOFF game and decide the maximum 
rebate a customer could possibly obtain. 

<P>
Consider, for example, the game board below. Assume we have 5 turns to finish the game, 
and each turn we can move between 1 and 4 spaces depending on what we spin. Notice that 
we must start just before the board begins, so spinning a 1 causes us to land on the 
first square. Also notice we must end by landing past the end of the last square. 
It does not have to be exact; any number that gets us off of the board will work.

<P>

</DIV>

<P>
The illustration shows two different possible ways the game might go. Following the arrows 
on the top, if we spin a 2, 3, 4, 1, and 1 respectively, we will win a total rebate of 
50 + 30 + 20 + 70 = $170. However, the best possible rebate we could win would be $220. 
We would win this amount if we spun a 1, 3, 2, 4, and 1 respectively, as shown by the 
lower path. Notice that we did not land on every square with a positive number; if we 
had we wouldn't have been able to make it to the end of the board before the 5 turns was up.

<P>
The illustration in Figure 2 shows a game where we have 4 turns to finish the game, and 
can move up to 3 spaces each turn. Again, two different paths are shown, the one on top 
earning a rebate of -$150, and the one on bottom earning a rebate of -$100. In fact, 
-$100 is the highest possible rebate we could earn for this game (a fact that would no 
doubt please the management of Gleamin' Lemon). Of course, there also might be a 
sequence of moves in which we do not reach the end before the turn limit -- e.g. 
spinning a 1 every time. Although not finishing would actually be preferable to 
finishing with a negative rebate, in this problem we are only going to consider 
sequences of moves which allow us to reach the end before the turn limit.

<P>
The output for each data set is one line containing only the maximum possible rebate that 
can be earned by completing the game. 

<P>
To complete the game you must advance a total of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> + 1</SPAN> spaces in at most <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> turns, each 
turn advancing from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> spaces inclusive. It will always be possible to complete a 
game. However, there may be a very large number of different turn sequences that will 
finish, so you will need to be careful in choosing your algorithm.

<P>Henry has a time lapse camera that can take a set of 3 images in one shot. The three images are taken by the camera at different time lapse. For example, if the first image is taken at 0.33 seconds after the shot, then the second image is automatically taken at 0.51 seconds and the third image is taken at 0.62 seconds after the shot. The time lapses of taking the images are not reliable but the spatial coordinate <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>)</SPAN> between images remain the same due to high speed shutter.<P>One nice evening during a sport festival, Henry placed a grid net in front of camera and started shooting the movement of a ball. Once the images were developed, Henry measured and recorded the coordinates of the ball on each image. Now he wants to know the highest height that the ball had achieved in a set of 3 images.<P>You need to help Henry by writing a program to compute the approximation of height that the ball has achieved in each set of images by assuming that the movement of the ball forms a parabolic curve.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>A test case consists of the coordinate of 3 points where the ball was captured by the camera.

<P>International Cyber Police Corporation (ICPC) had built a new mega-tall business center to host its headquarters and to lease some space for extra profit. It has so many floors, that it is impractical to have a separate button in each of its <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> elevator cars for each individual floor. Instead, each elevator car has just two buttons. One button in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>-th elevator car makes it move up <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>u</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> floors, the other makes it move down <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> floors. The business center is so high, that we can ignore its height for this problem (you will never reach the top floor), but you cannot go below the ground floor.

<P>Peter studies the theory of relational databases. Table in the relational database consists of values that are arranged in rows and columns.<P>There are different <SPAN CLASS="textit">normal forms</SPAN> that database may adhere to. Normal forms are designed to minimize the redundancy of data in the database. For example, a database table for a library might have a row for each book and columns for book name, book author, and author's email.<P>If the same author wrote several books, then this representation is clearly redundant. To formally define this kind of redundancy Peter has introduced his own normal form. A table is in Peter's Normal Form (PNF) if and only if there is no pair of rows and a pair of columns such that the values in the corresponding columns are the same for both rows.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=3 BORDER FRAME=BOX RULES=GROUPS><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=LEFT><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>How to compete in ACM ICPC</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>Peter</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>peter@neerc.ifmo.ru</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>How to win ACM ICPC</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>Michael</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>michael@neerc.ifmo.ru</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>Notes from ACM ICPC champion</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>Michael</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>michael@neerc.ifmo.ru</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P>The above table is clearly not in PNF, since values for 2rd and 3rd columns repeat in 2nd and 3rd rows.

<P>
Having studied mutual exclusion protocols in the previous year's competition you are now facing a more challenging problem. You have a 
big enterprise system with a number concurrently running processes. The system has several resources -- databases, message queues, etc. 
Each concurrent process works with two resources at a time. For example, one process might copy a job from a particular database into the 
message queue, the other process might take a job from the message queue, perform the job, and then put the result into some other message 
queue, etc. 

<P>
All resources are protected from concurrent access by mutual exclusion protocols also known as locks. For example, to access a particular 
database process acquires the lock for this database, then performs its work, then releases the lock. No two processes can hold the same 
lock at the same time (that is the property of mutual exclusion). Thus, the process that tries to acquire a lock <SPAN  CLASS="textit">waits</SPAN> if that 
lock is taken by some other process. 

<P>
The main loop of the process that works with resources <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN> looks like this: 

<P>
<PRE>
     loop forever
       DoSomeNonCriticalWork()
       P.lock()
       Q.lock()
       WorkWithResourcesPandQ()
       Q.unlock()
       P.unlock()
     end loop
</PRE> 

<P>
The order in which locks for resources P and Q are taken is important. Consider a case where
process <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN> had acquired lock <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> with <TT>P.lock()</TT> and is waiting for lock <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN> in <TT>Q.lock()</TT>.
It means that lock <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN> is taken by some other process <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN>. If the process <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN> is working (not
waiting), then we say that there is a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">wait chain</SPAN> of length 1. If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN> had acquired lock <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN>
and is waiting for another lock <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN>, which is acquired by a working process <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>e</I></SPAN>, then we say 
that there is a wait chain of length 2, etc. If any process in this <SPAN  CLASS="textit">wait chain</SPAN> waits for 
lock <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> that is already taken by process <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN>, then we say that the wait chain has infinite length and 
the system <SPAN  CLASS="textit">deadlocks</SPAN>. 

<P>
For this problem, we are interested only in alternating wait chains where processes hold their first locks and wait for the second ones. 
Formally:

<P>There is a well know game with words. Given a word you have to write as many other words as possible using the letters from the given word. If the letter repeats multiple times in the original word, you can use it up to as many times in the new words. The order of letters in the original word does not matter.

<P>
You have a revolver gun with a cylinder that has n chambers. Chambers are located in a circle on a cylinder. Each chamber can be 
empty or can contain a round. One chamber is aligned with the gun's barrel. When trigger of the gun is pulled, the gun's cylinder 
rotates, aligning the next chamber with the barrel, hammer strikes the round, making a shot by firing a bullet through the barrel. 
If the chamber is empty when the hammer strikes it, then there is no shot but just a ``click".

<P>
You have found a use for this gun. You are playing Russian Roulette with your friend. Your friend loads rounds into some chambers, 
randomly rotates the cylinder, aligning a random chamber with a gun's barrel, puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger. 
You hear ``click" and nothing else -- the chamber was empty and the gun did not shoot. 

<P>
Now it is your turn to put the gun to your head and pull the trigger. You have a choice. You can either pull the 
trigger right away or you can randomly rotate the gun's cylinder 
and then pull the trigger. What should you choose to maximize the chances of your survival?

represents the pattern of rounds that were loaded into the gun's chambers. ``<TT>0</TT>" represent an empty chamber, ``<TT>1</TT>" represent a 
loaded one. In this representation, when cylinder rotates before a shot, the next chamber to the right gets aligned with the barrel for a shot. 
Since the chambers are actually located on a circle, the first chamber in this string follows the last one. There is at least one ``<TT>0</TT>"

Nodes of the graph represent different points in ski resort and edges of the graph represent slopes between the points, with the direction of edges going downwards.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="342" HEIGHT="297" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/45/p4597.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4597.eps}"></DIV><P>Your team has to inspect each slope of the ski resort. Ski lifts on this resort are not open yet, but you have a helicopter. In one flight the helicopter can drop one person into any point of the resort. From the drop off point the person can ski down the slopes, inspecting each slope as they ski. It is fine to inspect the same slope multiple times, but you have to minimize the usage of the helicopter. So, you have to figure out how to inspect all the slopes with the fewest number of helicopter flights.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>Input consists of several datasets.

<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Each guard works during the same time intervals every day. 
</LI>
<LI>Each guard works within his/her time windows of availability, which 
s/he specifies. 
</LI>
<LI>Each guard works at most the amount of time s/he is able, which s/he also 
specifies. 
</LI>
<LI>The guards can only shift (start or stop working) on half hour boundaries. 
(e.g. 04:00 or 04:30, but not 04:15). 
</LI>
<LI>The guards are only scheduled for shifts if they are available to work at all times 
during those shifts. (e.g. if a guardÃ¢Â€ÂŸs window of availability opens at 03:05, they 
cannot be scheduled at 03:00.)

Write a program to help the museum staff determine the maximum number of guards that they can 
maintain at all times throughout a 24-hour day, given the constraints of the guards' 
availability. You may assume that guard exchanges are instantaneous. That is, if 2 guards 
leave and 2 other guards arrive at the same time, the museum is guarded by 2 guards 
through this exchange.

<P>Marcia loves to knit. As she knits, she wonders how many stitches the project she is working on will take to complete.<P>On every project, she starts with a row of a given number of stitches, and then adds more rows. Sometimes the next row will have the same number of stitches as the previous row and other times the next row will have more or less stitches than the previous row.<P>For example, a pattern for a triangular shawl may begin with just 3 stitches and add 2 stitches on each row. So, the first row will have 3 stitches, the second row will have 5 stitches, the third will have 7 stitches, and so on. If the project has a total of 3 rows, then it has a total of 15 stitches.<P>A more complex scarf project may have a 4 row repeating pattern that increases 6 stitches on the first row of the pattern, decreases 2 stitches on each of the next two rows, and has no change on the final row of the pattern. So, a scarf that has 50 stitches on the first row will have 56 on the second row, 54 on the third row, 52 on the fourth row, and 52 on the fifth row. On the sixth row, the pattern repeats, so there will be an increase of 6 stitches for a total of 58 stitches on that row. If the project stops there at 6 rows, then it will have a total of 322 stitches.<P>You will write a program to help Marcia figure out how many stitches a project will take to complete.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input to your program will be information about one or more projects.

<P>
You have entered a robot in a Robot Challenge. A course is set up in a 100m by 100m space. 
Certain points are identified within the space as targets. They are ordered -- there is a 
target 1, a target 2, etc. Your robot must start at (0,0). From there, it should go to 
target 1, stop for 1 second, go to target 2, stop for 1 second, and so on. It must 
finally end up at, and stop for a second on, (100,100). 

<P>
Each target except (0,0) and 
(100,100) has a time penalty for missing it. So, if your robot went straight from target 1 
to target 3, skipping target 2, it would incur target 2's penalty. Note that once it hits 
target 3, it cannot go back to target 2. It must hit the targets in order. Since your robot
 must stop for 1 second on each target point, it is not in danger of hitting a target 
accidentally too soon. For example, if target point 3 lies directly between target points 
1 and 2, your robot can go straight from 1 to 2, right over 3, without stopping. Since it 
didn't stop, the judges will not mistakenly think that it hit target 3 too soon, so they 
won't assess target 2's penalty. Your final score is the amount of time (in seconds) your 
robot takes to reach (100,100), completing the course, plus all penalties. Smaller scores 
are better. 

<P>
Your robot is very maneuverable, but a bit slow. It moves at 1 m/s, but can turn 
very quickly. During the 1 second it stops on a target point, it can easily turn to face the 
next target point. Thus, it can always move in a straight line between target points. 

<P>
Because your robot is a bit slow, it might be advantageous to skip some targets, and incur their 
penalty, rather than actually maneuvering to them. Given a description of a course, determine
your robot's best (lowest) possible score.

For example, the expression above can be represented by the graph on the right in the figure. While the tree contains 21 nodes, the graph just contains 7 nodes.<p class="noindent">Since the tree on the left in the figure is also a graph, the representation using graphs is not necessarily unique.

Each number points to the root node of the subexpression which should be inserted at that position. Nodes are numbered sequentially, starting with 1; this numbering includes just the nodes of the graph (not those which have been replaced by numbers). Numbers must point to nodes written down before (no forward pointers). For our example, we obtain &#8220;a(b(f(a,4),b(3,f)),f(2,6))&#8221;.<p class="noindent"><span class="cmbx-10">Sample Input </span><div class="alltt"><p class="noindent"><div class="obeylines-v"><br /><span class="cmtt-10">3</span><br /><span class="cmtt-10">this(is(a,tiny),tree)</span><br /><span class="cmtt-10">a(b(f(a,a),b(f(a,a),f)),f(b(f(a,a),b(f(a,a),f)),f))</span><br /><span class="cmtt-10">z(zz(zzzz(zz,z),zzzz(zz,z)),zzzz(zz(zzzz(zz,z),zzzz(zz,z)),z))</span><br /></div></div><p class="noindent"><span class="cmbx-10">Sample Output </span><div class="alltt"><p class="noindent"><div class="obeylines-v"><br /><span class="cmtt-10">this(is(a,tiny),tree)</span><br /><span class="cmtt-10">a(b(f(a,4),b(3,f)),f(2,6))</span><br /><span class="cmtt-10">z(zz(zzzz(zz,z),3),zzzz(2,5))</span><br /></div></div></body></html>

With only a single lane, this is a bottleneck for two-way traffic. Your job is to schedule incoming cars at both ends so that the last car leaves the road as early as possible.<p class="noindent">Each car is specified by three values: the direction in which it is going, the arrival time at the corresponding beginning of the road, and the driving time this car needs to get through, provided it is not slowed down by other cars in front. Cars cannot overtake each other on the mountain road, and reordering cars in the queues at the ends of the road is not allowed.<p class="noindent">For safety reasons, two successive cars going in the same direction may not pass any point of the road within less than 10 seconds. This ensures that the second car will not crash into the first car if the latter brakes hard. However, if another car passes in the other direction in between, it will be clear that the road is empty, so in this case, this rule does not apply.<p class="noindent"><span class="cmbx-10">Input</span><br class="newline" />The first line of the input consists of a single integer <span class="cmmi-10">c </span>(1 <span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span class="cmmi-10">c </span><span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span>200), the number of test cases.<p class="noindent">Then follow the test cases, each beginning with a single line consisting of an integer <span class="cmmi-10">n </span>(1 <span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span class="cmmi-10">n </span><span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span>200), the number of cars you are to consider in this test case.

However, most people probably do not think of it that way &#8211; even though it makes travel in the city a lot easier, we generally want to spend as little time as possible on the subway.<p class="noindent">After your experience in NWERC 2009, Nuremberg holds a special place in your heart, and some years later you decide to move here. Your only problem is to figure out which part of Nuremberg to move to. Naturally, you want to move to a nice neighborhood, but since most parts of the city are nice there are still a lot of choices. Being naturally averse to spending hours each day on commuting, you instead decide to choose a place based on the amount of time you will have to spend on the subway.<p class="noindent">Now, if you were only going to go to one place, it would be easy to find the best place to live. But of course, there are several places where you anticipate that you will go regularly, such as work, friends, and the occasional Christkindlesmarkt. In order to be able to work this out, you have written a list of all the places which you want to visit regularly, along with estimates of how often you want to go there. For simplicity, you assume that you will always go somewhere and then back home, e.g., if you are going to Christkindlesmarkt after work you will drop by your house on the way from work before going to the markt, rather than going to the markt directly from work. Now, you have to find the place to live for which the total travel time is minimal.<p class="noindent">Because Nuremberg has an extensive public transportation system, you will be using the subway for traveling. The subway net is quite big, but is still fairly easily maneuvered because it is shaped like a tree. In other words, there is always a unique path between any pair of subway stations. (This is not quite true for the Nuremberg subway of today, but when you move here in a few years, we anticipate that it will be true.)<p class="noindent"><span class="cmbx-10">Input</span><br class="newline" />The input consists of several test cases. The first line of input contains an integer <span class="cmmi-10">c </span>(1 <span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span class="cmmi-10">c </span><span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span>200), giving the number of test cases. Then, each test case starts with an integer <span class="cmmi-10">n </span>(1 <span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span class="cmmi-10">n </span><span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span>50000), giving the number of subway stations in Nuremberg. Then follow <span class="cmmi-10">n </span><span class="cmsy-10">- </span>1 lines, describing the subway net. Each of these lines contains three integers <span class="cmmi-10">a</span>, <span class="cmmi-10">b</span>, and <span class="cmmi-10">t </span>(1 <span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span class="cmmi-10">a,b </span><span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span class="cmmi-10">n</span>, and 1 <span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span class="cmmi-10">t </span><span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span>300), indicating that stations <span class="cmmi-10">a </span>and <span class="cmmi-10">b </span>are adjacent and that it takes <span class="cmmi-10">t </span>seconds to travel between them. This is followed by a line containing an integer <span class="cmmi-10">m </span>(0 <span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span class="cmmi-10">m </span><span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span class="cmmi-10">n</span>), denoting the number of stations which you want to go to regularly. Then follow <span class="cmmi-10">m </span>lines. Each of these lines contains two integers <span class="cmmi-10">a </span>and <span class="cmmi-10">f</span> (1 <span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span class="cmmi-10">a </span><span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span class="cmmi-10">n</span>, 1 <span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span class="cmmi-10">f </span><span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span>500), where <span class="cmmi-10">a </span>is the station you want to visit and <span class="cmmi-10">f </span>is the number of times you want to visit this station in a year. No station will occur in this list more than once.<p class="noindent"><span class="cmbx-10">Output</span><br class="newline" />For each test case, first output a line containing the number of seconds spent in traffic during a year, provided you choose an optimal place to live.

The organizer of the congress reserved exactly one hotel room for each inventor. Each inventor, however, had its own preference regarding which room he would like to stay in. Being a clever inventor himself, the organizer soon found an objective way of doing the room assignments in a fair manner: each inventor wrote two different room numbers on a fair coin, one room number on each side. Then, each inventor threw his coin and was assigned the room number which was shown on the upper side of his coin. If some room had been assigned to more than one inventor, all inventors had to throw their coins again.<p class="noindent">As you can imagine, this assignment process could take a long time or even not terminate at all. It has the advantage, however, that among all possible room assignments, one assignment is chosen randomly according to a uniform distribution. In order to apply this method in modern days, you should write a program which helps the organizer.<p class="noindent">The organizer himself needs a hotel room too. As the organizer, he wants to have some advantage: he should be able to rate each of the rooms (the higher the rating, the better), and the program should tell him which two room numbers he should write on his coin in order to maximize the expected rating of the room he will be assigned to. The program also has access to the choices of the other inventors before making the proposal. It should never propose two rooms for the organizer such that it is not possible to assign all inventors to the rooms, if a valid assignment is possible at all.<p class="noindent"><span class="cmbx-10">Input</span><br class="newline" />The input starts with a single number <span class="cmmi-10">c </span>(1 <span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span class="cmmi-10">c </span><span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span>200) on one line, the number of test cases. Each test case starts with one line containing a number <span class="cmmi-10">n </span>(2 <span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span class="cmmi-10">n </span><span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span>50000), the number of inventors and rooms. The following <span class="cmmi-10">n </span><span class="cmsy-10">- </span>1 lines contain the choices of the <span class="cmmi-10">n </span><span class="cmsy-10">- </span>1 guests (excluding the organizer). For each inventor, there is a line containing two numbers <span class="cmmi-10">a </span>and <span class="cmmi-10">b </span>(1 <span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span class="cmmi-10">a &#x003C; b </span><span class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span class="cmmi-10">n</span>), the two room numbers which are selected by the inventor.

This board consists of hexagonal resource tiles containing five different resources: clay, lumber, wool, grain, and ore.

Therefore, we have invented a new way of creating the playing board. Starting in the middle and spiraling outwards, each time we add a new tile to the board we choose the resource of the tile according to the following rules:<ul class="itemize1"><li class="itemize">the new tile must be different from its neighboring tiles on the board so far; </li><li class="itemize">in case multiple tiles are possible, we choose a resource that occurs the least number of times on the board so far; </li><li class="itemize">in case multiple tiles are still possible, the new resource must have the lowest number possible.</li></ul><p class="noindent">The figure underneath shows how to spiral outwards and which resource tiles are chosen first.

<P>You had an accountant, who recorded all your expenses. Each day you sent her notes on expenses and she appended them to a single big summary file. Each of your notes consisted of several rows, like the following:<P><PRE>
bed = 100 
table = 150 
furniture = bed + table 
furniture = furniture + 10
</PRE><P>which (probably) meant that you spent 250 on furniture and 10 on transport (probably). More generally, each row in your note was one of the following:<P><PRE>
name = number 
name = item + item
</PRE><P>where <TT>item</TT> was either <TT>number</TT> or <TT>name</TT>, <TT>number</TT> was a natural number not exceeding <SPAN CLASS="MATH">10<SUP>9</SUP></SPAN> (with no leading zeroes) and name was an arbitrary sequence of small and capital letters.<P>While transferring your notes to the summary file, the accountant neither changed the order of rows of a note nor shuffled rows of difflerent notes.

<P>The Company is testing its brand new face recognition solution. The application is supposed to recognize people given their profiles. It is fed with a number of test cases to check if everything is working fine. Each test consists of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>n</I></SPAN> photos of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> persons; there is a left profile and a right profile of each person in a single test case. The program matches left profiles with right profiles, but it is still far from perfect, so sometimes several right profiles are assigned to a single left profile (and vice versa). A <SPAN CLASS="textit">consistent reconstruction</SPAN> is an assignment of <SPAN CLASS="textit">difflerent</SPAN> right profiles to <SPAN CLASS="textit">all</SPAN> left profiles, such that all the pairs matched were proposed by the program.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="918" HEIGHT="208" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/46/p4624.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4624.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">The program output (on the left) and four possible consistent reconstructions.</DIV><P>In order to test the program, it is necessary to verify every possible consistent reconstruction.

<P>Garland decorator is a profession which recently gained in importance, especially during Christmas time. Any kid can decorate a christmas tree, any parent can put gifts in sockets, and even anyone can start believing in Santa Claus, but hanging christmas garlands is a completely difflerent story. As you will learn, it is an extremely important, responsible and tough job.<P>A garland consists of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> pieces of equal length. Due to decorations like christmas balls attached to garlands, piece <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> has its own weight <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>. The garland has to be attached to the ceiling in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> spots, where the very beginning of the garland should be attached to spot 1 and its end to spot <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>. The garland should also be hooked to the remaining spots, which divides it into segments, each consisting of several consecutive pieces. There are, however, several rules that every respectable garland decorator should keep in mind.<P><P><BR><DL COMPACT><DT>(i)</DT><DD>Each segment should contain a positive even number of pieces. Due to this condition, we may divide a segment into two <SPAN CLASS="textit">half-segments</SPAN>.</DD><DT>(ii)</DT><DD>To minimize the chance that a guest hits your precious garland with their head (and tears it into pieces), the garland cannot hang too low: each half-segment can contain at most <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN> pieces.</DD><DT>(iii)</DT><DD>Finally, to keep the ceiling from falling on people heads, the decorator should minimize the weight of the heaviest half-segment.</DD></DL><P><P><BR>An example of an optimally hanging garland (consisting of twelve pieces in three segments) is presented below; weights of respective pieces are given in circles.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="730" HEIGHT="228" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/46/p4625.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4625.eps}"></DIV><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>The input contains several test cases.

<P>Bob is the leader of a team developing a hypervisor system <SPAN CLASS="textit">MacrOS</SPAN>. The project is huge and comprises lots of packages. Since some of them may depend on others, the installation process of the whole system is rather complicated. MacrOS is in alpha stage now, so there are many customers testing the new product. The installation process is overwhelming for many of them, and unfortunately the technical support is Bob's responsibility as well.<P>Bob had been given a list of dependencies by his team of programmers before the alpha tests started. Each dependency reads ``package <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> depends on <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>", i.e., one has to install package <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> before <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>. This is denoted <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I>&nbsp;<I>B</I></SPAN> in short. Of course, if package <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> depends on <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> in turn depends on <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>, then <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> depends on <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> as well, i.e., the dependencies are transitive. For example, the initial list of dependencies can be as follows:<P><P><BR><IMG WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="131" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/46/4626img1.png ALT="$\textstyle \parbox{.5\textwidth}{

\begin{center}
\mbox{}
\epsfbox{p4626.eps}
\end{center}}$"><P>As the product develops, the programmers sometimes call Bob to inform of new dependencies. Further, being in charge of technical support, Bob often receives phone calls from customers with questions which packages should be installed first. To no surprise, after several calls from programmers and customers, Bob realized how difficult it is to keep track of dependencies and answer queries on-line at the same time, and. For automatizing this process, he wrote a program which generated two log files. The first one contains the history of all phone calls. An entry `<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1&nbsp;<I>A</I>&nbsp;<I>B</I></SPAN>' denotes a new dependency introduced by the programmers, and `<SPAN CLASS="MATH">0&nbsp;<I>A</I>&nbsp;<I>B</I></SPAN>' denotes a query from a customer meaning ``should I install <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> before <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>?". The second log is a history of all answers given to customers. An example is given in Table 1.<P>After a long period of testing, MacrOS is finally ready to enter beta stage. But Bob wants to be sure that there were no mistakes during the alpha testing. He wants to check if the answers given in the second log file are correct, and you are to help him. However, Bob does not give you the second log file. Moreover, he modified the first log in a tricky way: after each line corresponding to customer phone call that should have been answered with <TT>NO</TT>, he started/stopped reversing all lines corresponding to programmers calls; see the example below. Taking into account the Bob's modification of the first log file, you should give all the answers to the customers' questions.<P><P><BR><IMG WIDTH="338" HEIGHT="342" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/46/4626img1.png ALT="$\textstyle \parbox{.6\textwidth}{

<P>Deep in the Carribean, there is an island even stranger than the Monkey Island, dwelled by Horatio Torquemada Marley. Not only it has a rectangular shape, but is also divided into an <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>m</I></SPAN> grid. Each grid field has a certain height. Unfortunately, the sea level started to raise and in year <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>, the level is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> meters. Another strange feature of the island is that it is made of sponge, and the water can freely flow through it. Thus, a grid field whose height is at most the current sea level is considered <SPAN CLASS="textit">flooded</SPAN>. Adjacent unflooded fields (i.e., sharing common edge) create unflooded areas. Sailors are interested in the number of unflooded areas in a given year.<P>An example of a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">4 <TT>x</TT> 5</SPAN> island is given below.

He is also a man, which means that he knows the names of no more than six colors, cannot tell the difflerence between ecru and white and associates plum only with fruits. But today he is leaving for a conference. He has just pulled a set of single socks out of washing machine and must pair them. He can say which sock is similar to which one, and he may pair only these socks which seem similar. However, many socks are similar to many others. Worse than that, similarity relation is not necessarily transitive. For example, for Jack blue feels similar to seagreen and seagreen to green, but Jack can distinguish between blue and green and say that they are not similar.<P>Jack wonders if there is exactly one way to pair all his socks.

Go is an oriental board game played on a <!-- MATH
 $19 \times 19$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">19 <TT>x</TT> 19</SPAN> grid, with two 
players taking turns to place black and white markers (called stones) 
on the grid intersections. A chain is a collection of stones defined by 
the following property: two stones of the same colour on the board are 
in the same chain if there is a path between those stones (following 
grid lines on the board) such that each intersection on the path is 
occupied by a stone of that colour. A chain is assigned the colour 
of the stones it contains. 

<P>
The number of liberties of a chain is the number of unoccupied 
intersections that are immediately adjacent to stones in the chain 
(again, following grid lines). If at some stage, a chain is reduced 
to zero liberties, it is captured by the opponent. 

<P>
Given representations of Go boards, you are required to output the 
number of liberties of each chain on the board.

<P>
The first line of the input will be a positive integer, indicating how 
many Go boards will follow. On the next line, the representation of 
the first board will begin. Each boardÃ¢Â€Â™s representation consists of 19 
lines, and boards will be separated by a blank line. Each line consists 
of 19 characters, each character denoting whether the corresponding 
intersection of the board is empty(<TT>.</TT>), occupied by a white stone (<TT>W</TT>), 
or occupied by a black stone (<TT>B</TT>). 

<P>

Every year, the Association for Confusing Mnemonics (ACM) runs a 
puzzle-solving competition. They borrowed the rules from the International 
Collegiate Programming Challenge, but simplified the rules about breaking 
ties. Like the ICPC, the contest runs for 300 minutes (5 hours). 

<P>
Teams may keep submitting solutions until they get a problem right. Each 
submission is given a submission time, which is the number of minutes from 
the start of the contest until the submission. Submission times are rounded 
to whole minutes, so they are integer values between 0 and 300 inclusive. 

<P>
Teams are ranked first by the number of problems solved. Where teams have 
solved the same number of problems, they are ranked by total time. The time 
consumed for a solved problem is the submission time of the correct 
submission, plus twenty penalty minutes for each incorrect submission on 
that problem. The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each 
solved problem; there is no time consumed for problems that are never 
solved. If there is still a tie, the judges allocate the order of the 
tied teams randomly. 

<P>
There is an electronic scoreboard that runs during the contest, and shows 
the current problems solved, failed attempts, and total time consumed for 
each team. To keep the final results secret until the presentation of 
awards, the scoreboard is frozen partway through the contest. Submissions 
whose time (after rounding) is strictly less than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> are reflected on the 
scoreboard, while submissions whose time (after rounding) is greater than 
or equal to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> are not shown. 

<P>
At the presentation ceremony, the top <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> teams are awarded prizes, and in 
each case, the number of problems solved and the total time is announced. 
For all the other teams, only the number of problems solved is announced. 

<P>
Many teams would like to be able to claim to have beaten their traditional 
rivals, but it may not be obvious from the final standings whether this is 
the case. Your task is to examine the information from the frozen scoreboard 
and the announced final results, and answer queries of the form ``might t
eam A have beaten team B?"

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The information is guaranteed to be consistent. For example, the final 
number of problems solved will never be less than the number on the 
frozen scoreboard. While there is no limit on the number of times a 
problem may be attempted, the input file will not contain any number 
larger than 10 000.

they placed (the winning team appearing first, then the second-place team 
etc). The remaining teams are listed in arbitrary order. 

<P>
The remainder of the test case consists of query lines. Each query line 
consists of two distinct team names, separated by a space. The test case 
is terminated by a line containing two dashes separated by a space, 
``<TT>- -</TT>". Each test case contains between 2 and 100 queries,

The end of input is indicated by a line containing a single zero.

<P>
You are responsible for implementing a driver to communicate telemetry 
data to an external device. The particular external device in question 
happens to use a very basic microprocessor that only has an 8-bit 
accumulator register. During normal operations, your program will 
send a short sequence of signed 8-bit values to the external device 
(between 1 and 10 such numbers in any given sequence). 

<P>
The external device will compute the sum of all the values in a given 
sequence, by starting with the first one, then adding the second to it, 
then adding the next one to the result, and so on. Unfortunately, you 
have discovered (after extensive debugging after midnight) that the 
microprocessor of the external device crashes if you send it particular 
sequences of values. More debugging revealed that any sequence that 
produces a result outside of the range -128..127 during the calculation 
of the sum will cause the microprocessor of the external device to crash. 
(Your favourite hypothesis on this behaviour is that the developer of the 
software of the external device forgot to turn off the processor 
exception caused by the overflow, and that no interrupt handler was set up.) 

<P>
Since you can not fix the external device, you have to code a workaround 
on your side. The simplest solution seems to be to reorder the sequence 
to guarantee that all intermediate values stored in the accumulator while 
computing the sum are in the range -128..127. But first you have to write 
a program to count how many valid orderings of the sequence can be formed.

You are a member of a notorious gang of bank robbers. Part of your success 
has always been due to your impressive getaway strategies. Your next 
target is a bank in Manhattan, and you are concerned that a clean 
getaway may be hampered by the traffic on the roads. 

<P>
To help you to plan the best possible escape route you have collected 
information on the average time required to traverse a given section 
of the road under the expected traffic conditions at the time of the 
robbery. You have measured the time needed to travel from one 
intersection to the next, including the delay spent waiting at 
the first intersection of that road segment. Incidentally, it would 
appear that you wait exactly one minute at each intersection. 

<P>
With this detailed information you set about planning an optimal escape 
route. From experience, you know that you will have to get out of 
Manhattan extremely quickly, or you are sure to be caught. The only 
way to reduce the travel time would be to skip some of the intersections, 
i.e., to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> stop at all of the traffic lights. This is clearly 
a risky proposition, so using accident statistics you have derived a 
probability figure for successfully crossing each intersection, taking 
into account that the light may be red in your direction. Given your 
chosen profession, you are clearly willing to take some risks, but you 
are not willing to accept a route that has a total probability of 
avoiding collisions of less than 0.5. 

<P>
Your objective is therefore to find the quickest route from the bank to 
your exit point, while keeping in mind that you can skip some of the 
traffic lights, shaving one minute off those segments in the process.

<SPAN  CLASS="textit">International Center for Picassonian Cubism</SPAN> is a Spanish national museum of cubist artworks, 
dedicated to Pablo Picasso. The center held a competition for an artwork that will be 
displayed in front of the facade of the museum building. The artwork is a collection of 
cubes that are piled up on the ground and is intended to amuse visitors, who will be curious 
how the shape of the collection of cubes changes when it is seen from the front and the sides. 

<P>
The artwork is a collection of cubes with edges of one foot long and is built on a Ã¯Â¬Â‚at ground 
that is divided into a grid of one foot by one foot squares. Due to some technical reasons, 
cubes of the artwork must be either put on the ground, fitting into a unit square in the grid, 
or put on another cube in the way that the bottom face of the upper cube exactly meets the 
top face of the lower cube. No other way of putting cubes is possible. 

<P>
You are a member of the judging committee responsible for selecting one out of a plenty of 
artwork proposals submitted to the competition. The decision is made primarily based on 
artistic quality but the cost for installing the artwork is another important factor. Your 
task is to investigate the installation cost for each proposal. The cost is proportional to 
the number of cubes, so you have to figure out the minimum number of cubes needed for 
installation. 

<P>
Each design proposal of an artwork consists of the front view and the side view (the view 
seen from the right-hand side), as shown in Figure 1.

<P>
The front view (resp., the side view) indicates the maximum heights of piles of cubes for 
each column line (resp., row line) of the grid. 

<P>
There are several ways to install this proposal of artwork, such as the following figures.

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

 ALT="\epsfbox{p4636b.eps}">
</DIV>

<P>
In these figures, the dotted lines on the ground indicate the grid lines. The left figure 
makes use of 16 cubes, which is not optimal. That is, the artwork can be installed with a 
fewer number of cubes. Actually, the right one is optimal and only uses 13 cubes. Note that, 
a single pile of height three in the right figure plays the roles of two such piles in the 
left one. 

<P>
Notice that swapping columns of cubes does not change the side view. Similarly, swapping 
rows does not change the front view. Thus, such swaps do not change the costs of building 
the artworks. For example, consider the artwork proposal given in Figure 2.

<P>
Despite urging requests of the townspeople, the municipal office cannot afford to improve 
many of the apparently deficient city amenities under this recession. The city swimming 
pool is one of the typical examples. It has only two swimming lanes. The Municipal Fitness 
Agency, under this circumstances, settled usage rules so that the limited facilities can 
be utilized fully. 

<P>
Two lanes are to be used for one-way swimming of different directions. Swimmers are requested 
to start swimming in one of the lanes, from its one end to the other, and then change the 
lane to swim his/her way back. When he or she reaches the original starting end, he/she 
should return to his/her initial lane and starts swimming again. 

<P>
Each swimmer has his/her own natural constant pace. Swimmers, however, are not permitted 
to pass other swimmers except at the ends of the pool; as the lanes are not wide enough, 
that might cause accidents. If a swimmer is blocked by a slower swimmer, he/she has to 
follow the slower swimmer at the slower pace until the end of the lane is reached. Note 
that the blocking swimmer's natural pace may be faster than the blocked swimmer; the 
blocking swimmer might also be blocked by another swimmer ahead, whose natural pace is 
slower than the blocked swimmer. Blocking would have taken place whether or not a faster 
swimmer was between them. 

<P>
Swimmers can change their order if they reach the end of the lane simultaneously. They 
change their order so that ones with faster natural pace swim in front. When a group of 
two or more swimmers formed by a congestion reaches the end of the lane, they are 
considered to reach there simultaneously, and thus change their order there. 

<P>
The number of swimmers, their natural paces in times to swim from one end to the other, 
and the numbers of laps they plan to swim are given. Note that here one ``lap" means 
swimming from one end to the other and then swimming back to the original end. Your 
task is to calculate the time required for all the swimmers to finish their plans. All the 
swimmers start from the same end of the pool at the same time, the faster swimmers in front. 

<P>
In solving this problem, you can ignore the sizes of swimmers' bodies, and also ignore the 
time required to change the lanes and the order in a group of swimmers at an end of the lanes.

Origami is the traditional Japanese art of paper folding. One day, Professor Egami found 
the message board decorated with some pieces of origami works pinned on it, and became 
interested in the pinholes on the origami paper. Your mission is to simulate paper 
folding and pin punching on the folded sheet, and calculate the number of pinholes on 
the original sheet when unfolded. 

<P>
A sequence of folding instructions for a Ã¯Â¬Â‚at and square piece of paper and a single 
pinhole position are specified. As a folding instruction, two points <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN> are given. 
The paper should be folded so that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> touches <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN> from above (Figure 4). To make a fold, we 
first divide the sheet into two segments by creasing the sheet along the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">folding line</SPAN>, 
i.e., the perpendicular bisector of the line segment <SPAN  CLASS="textit">PQ</SPAN>, and then turn over the 
segment containing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> onto the other. You can ignore the thickness of the paper.

</DIV>

<P>
The original Ã¯Â¬Â‚at square piece of paper is folded into a structure consisting of layered 
paper segments, which are connected by linear hinges. For each instruction, we fold one 
or more paper segments along the specified folding line, dividing the original segments 
into new smaller ones. The folding operation turns over some of the paper segments (not 
only the new smaller segments but also some other segments that have no intersection with 
the folding line) to the reÃ¯Â¬Â‚ective position against the folding line. That is, for a 
paper segment that intersects with the folding line, one of the two new segments made 
by dividing the original is turned over; for a paper segment that does not intersect 
with the folding line, the whole segment is simply turned over. 

<P>
The folding operation is carried out repeatedly applying the following rules, until we 
have no segment to turn over.

<P>Consider a closed world and a set of features that are defined for all the objects in the world. Each feature can be answered with ``yes" or ``no". Using those features, we can identify any object from the rest of the objects in the world. In other words, each object can be represented as a fixed-length sequence of booleans. Any object is different from other objects by at least one feature.<P>You would like to identify an object from others. For this purpose, you can ask a series of questions to someone who knows what the object is. Every question you can ask is about one of the features. He/she immediately answers each question with ``yes" or ``no" correctly. You can choose the next question after you get the answer to the previous question.<P>You kindly pay the answerer 100 yen as a tip for each question. Because you don't have surplus money, it is necessary to minimize the number of questions in the worst case. You don't know what is the correct answer, but fortunately know all the objects in the world.

<P>ICPC (International Connecting Points Company) starts to sell a new railway toy. It consists of a toy tramcar and many rail units on square frames of the same size. There are four types of rail units, namely, straight (S), curve (C), left-switch (L) and right-switch (R) as shown in Figure 9. A switch has three ends, namely, branch/merge-end (B/M-end), straight-end (S-end) and curve-end (C-end).<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="998" HEIGHT="203" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/46/p4644a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4644a.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 9: Four rail types</DIV><P>A switch is either in ``through" or ``branching" state. When the tramcar comes from B/M-end, and if the switch is in the through-state, the tramcar goes through to S-end and the state changes to branching; if the switch is in the branching-state, it branches toward C-end and the state changes to through. When the tramcar comes from S-end or C-end, it goes out from B/M-end regardless of the state. The state does not change in this case.<P>Kids are given rail units of various types that fill a rectangle area of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>h</I></SPAN>, as shown in Figure 10(a). Rail units meeting at an edge of adjacent two frames are automatically connected. Each rail unit may be independently rotated around the center of its frame by multiples of 90 degrees in order to change the connection of rail units, but its position cannot be changed.<P>Kids should make ``valid" layouts by rotating each rail unit, such as getting Figure 10(b) from Figure 10(a). A layout is valid when all rails at three ends of every switch are directly or indirectly connected to an end of another switch or itself. A layout in Figure 10(c) is invalid as well as Figure 10(a). Invalid layouts are frowned upon.<P>When a tramcar runs in a valid layout, it will eventually begin to repeat the same route forever. That is, we will eventually find the tramcar periodically comes to the same running condition, which is a triple of the tramcar position in the rectangle area, its direction, and the set of the states of all the switches.<P><P><BR>A periodical route is a sequence of rail units on which the tramcar starts from a rail unit with a running condition and returns to the same rail unit with the same running condition for the first time.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="1111" HEIGHT="526" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/46/p4644a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4644b.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 10: Rail units in <SPAN CLASS="MATH">5 <TT>x</TT> 2</SPAN> matrix form</DIV><P>A periodical route through a switch or switches is called the ``fun route", since kids like the rattling sound the tramcar makes when it passes through a switch. The tramcar takes the same unit time to go through a rail unit, not depending on the types of the unit or the tramcar directions. After the tramcar starts on a rail unit on a ``fun route", it will come back to the same unit with the same running condition, sooner or later. The fun time <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> of a fun route is the number of time units that the tramcar takes for going around the route.<P>Of course, kids better enjoy layouts with longer fun time. Given a variety of rail units placed on a rectangular area, your job is to rotate the given rail units appropriately and to find the fun route with the longest fun time in the valid layouts.<P>For example, there is a fun route in Figure 10(b). Its fun time is 24. Let the toy tramcar start from B/M-end at (1, 2) toward (1, 3) and the states of all the switches are the through-states. It goes through (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2) and (1, 2). Here, the tramcar goes through (1, 2) with the same position and the same direction, but with the different states of the switches. Then the tramcar goes through (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1) and (1, 2). Here, the tramcar goes through (1, 2) again, but with the same switch states as the initial ones. Counting the rail units the tramcar visited, the tramcar should have run 24 units of time after its start, and thus the fun time is 24.<P>There may be many valid layouts with the given rail units. For example, a valid layout containing a fun route with the fun time 120 is shown in Figure 11(a). Another valid layout containing a fun route with the fun time 148 derived from that in Figure 11(a) is shown in Figure 11(b). The four rail units whose rotations are changed from Figure 11(a) are indicated by the thick lines.<P>A valid layout depicted in Figure 12(a) contains two fun routes, where one consists of the rail units (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2) with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I> = 8</SPAN>, and the other consists of all the remaining rail units with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I> = 18</SPAN>.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="866" HEIGHT="448" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/46/p4644a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4644c.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 11: valid layouts</DIV><P>Another valid layout depicted in Figure 12(b) has two fun routes whose fun times are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I> = 12</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I> = 20</SPAN>. The layout in Figure 12(a) is different from that in Figure 12(b) at the eight rail units rotated by multiples of 90 degrees. There are other valid layouts with some rotations of rail units but there is no fun route with the fun time longer than 20, so that the longest fun time for this example (Figure 12) is 20.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="1026" HEIGHT="325" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/46/p4644a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4644d.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 12: Fun routes in valid layouts</DIV><P>Note that there may be simple cyclic routes that do not go through any switches in a valid layout, which are not counted as the fun routes.

The required time for going around the simple cyclic route is 20 that is greater than fun times of the fun routes.

<P>The earth is under an attack of a deadly virus. Luckily, prompt actions of the Ministry of Health against this emergency successfully confined the spread of the infection within a square grid of areas. Recently, public health specialists found an interesting pattern with regard to the transition of infected areas. At each step in time, every area in the grid changes its infection state according to infection states of its directly (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) adjacent areas.<P><P><BR><UL><LI>An infected area continues to be infected if it has two or three adjacent infected areas. </LI><LI>An uninfected area becomes infected if it has exactly three adjacent infected areas. </LI><LI>An area becomes free of the virus, otherwise. </LI></UL><P><P><BR>Your mission is to fight against the virus and disinfect all the areas. The Ministry of Health lets an anti-virus vehicle prototype under your command. The functionality of the vehicle is summarized as follows.<P><P><BR><UL><LI>At the beginning of each time step, you move the vehicle to one of the eight adjacent areas. The vehicle is not allowed to move to an infected area (to protect its operators from the virus).

<P>The king Dongmyeong of Goguryeo, also known by his birth name Jumong, was the founding monarch of Goguryeo. Jumong had a son named Yuri from his first wife queen Yesoya, and two sons, Biryu and Onjo, from his second wife queen So Seo-no. They were happily living together, until it was the time to determine the true heir of Jumong. The candidates for the crown prince position are Yuri and Biryu.<P>In order to prevent a civil war, Jumong designed a game similar to Lotto and announced that the winner of the game would become the crown prince. In the beginning of the game, Jumong specifies an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>, then each player chooses a binary string (a string of <TT>0</TT>'s and <TT>1</TT>'s) of length <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>. The selected strings must be different; if they are equal, the string selection step is repeated again.<P>Having received two different strings of the same length, Jumong starts tossing a fair coin (a coin with equal probabilities for heads and tails) for several times. Treating heads as <TT>0</TT>'s and tails as <TT>1</TT>'s, the sequence of coin flipping produces a binary string growing on the right. The player whose string appears earlier in the growing binary string, wins the game and becomes the crown prince.<P>Given the binary strings chosen by Yuri and Biryu, you have to calculate the winning probability of Yuri.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several test cases.

<p>In the Ancient Clash of Mystic Pandas (ACM Pandas) game, the player plays the role of a Panda Knight who needs to defend Panda Land by defeating evil Panda Wizards. As the wizards have special magical powers, they need to be defeated using specific types of Mystic Sticks (regular bamboo sticks are ineffective against them). To obtain a Mystic Stick, Panda Knight needs to craft it by infusing his regular bamboo stick with several different kinds of magic shards according to the known recipe for that particular type of Mystic Stick.</p>
<p>Normally, all kinds of shards can be purchased for 1 gold/piece from the Panda Magic Store (therefore Panda Knight will have no problem of acquiring the shards, as long as he has enough gold to buy them all from the Store). However due to the recent invasion, to conceal the shards from the incoming Panda Wizards, Panda Magic Store has packaged all the shards into inconspicuous Mystery Boxes. A Mystery Box contains a random piece of magic shard which type canÂ’t be determined prior to buying and opening the box, which Panda Knight can also buy for the same price (1 gold/box).</p>
<p>As his Panda Knight character is not rich, Mr. Wah is concerned about the possibility that heÂ’s unable to buy all the necessary shards due to not getting the required amount of a specific type of shard. He needs your help! Your task as Mr. Wah's best programmer friend is to compute the probability that he will be able to get all the shards and craft the Mystic Stick, so that he can plan his playing strategy accordingly. You can safely assume that all the required shards are available on the store via the Mystery Boxes, that the boxes will only contain the needed types of shard, and that each type of shard has equal probability of being contained inside any particular Mystery Box.</p>

<p>Explanation for 1<sup>st</sup> sample test case:</p>
There are 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 possible combinations of shard types that Knight Panda can get by purchasing 3 Mystery Boxes with his available gold:<br/>
<ol>
<li>1. Type 1, Type 1, Type 1</li>
<li>2. Type 1, Type 1, Type 2</li>
<li>3. Type 1, Type 2, Type 1</li>
<li>4. Type 1, Type 2, Type 2</li>
<li>5. Type 2, Type 1, Type 1</li>
<li>6. Type 2, Type 1, Type 2</li>
<li>7. Type 2, Type 2, Type 1</li>
<li>8. Type 2, Type 2, Type 2</li>
</ol>
<p>Since there are 6 out of 8 combinations that gives required amount of shards (at least one Type 1 shard and one Type 2 shard), the probability that Panda Knight will be able to craft the Mystic Stick is 6/8 = 75%.

<p>Do you know Lotto? Lotto is a game of probability. Six numbers are drawn from a range of numbers (such as 42, 47, 47, 49, 51, and 54). Michigan, for instance, has a 6-out-of-47 game (6/47), meaning that six numbers are drawn from possible 47. Florida's Lotto is 6/53, meaning that six numbers are drawn from a possible 53.</p>
<p>To play Lotto, indicate your six chosen numbers by marking the numbered squares on a play slip. Then take the play slip to a lottery retailer (or agent). The retailer enters your selection in the on-line terminal, which produces your game ticket. The ticket, not the play slip, is the official receipt and must be presented and validated in the event of a win. Always check to make sure that the correct date and numbers are on the game ticket before you leave. Lottery agents are found in convenience stores, gas stations, and grocery stores.</p>
<p>The cost for one chance at Lotto is still $1 in many states. So for one chance, or play, at Lotto, you would pay $1. For five plays -- that is, to play five sets of numbers--you would pay $5. Illinois offers a bargain: two plays for $1.</p>
<p>Typically, Lotto drawings are held twice a week, usually on Wednesday and Saturday nights. However, this may not be true for every state.</p>
<p>The lottery officials use special ball-drawing machines, and the balls are numbered. The machine randomly shoots out six selected balls; these balls display the winning numbers for that evening's lottery drawing. If all six of your numbers exactly match the numbers drawn, you win the jackpot. In Lotto, your numbers don't need to be listed in any particular order, as long as they match those drawn. (taken from http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/how-to-play-the-lottery1.htm)</p>
<p>In most case of lottery they don't draw same number, but in our problem here same number are allowed. So here, you can play number "42 42 45 45 45" which is not allowed in common lottos.</p>
<p>They say there's more chance of you getting hit by a car on your way to buy a lotto ticket than the chance of winning one. Is the probability to win really that small? You are about to help me find out.</p>

<p>Input starts with an integer <i>T</i> (1 &lt;= <i>T</i> &lt;= 10), the number of test cases. <i>T</i> input blocks follows. Each input blocks starts with an integer <i>M</i> (1 &lt;= <i>M</i> &lt;= 50), meaning that the game involves <i>M</i> distinct numbers particularly from 1 to <i>M</i>. You don't know how the ball-drawing machine works, but you do know that for there is a constant probability for each number to pop up. The second line of each input blocks will consists of <i>M</i> real-numbers <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>P</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>P</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>P</i><sub>4</sub>, ..., <i>P</i><sub>M</sub>, where <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> denotes the probability of ball with number <i>i</i> to pop-up. You can safely assume that the total probability is equal to 1.</p>
<p>The third line of input is an integer <i>Q</i> (1 &lt;= <i>Q</i> &lt;= 100), the number of queries. <i>Q</i> lines follow with each line begins with an integer <i>N</i> (1 &lt;= <i>N</i> &lt;= <i>M</i>). So if <i>N</i> is 6, you are playing 6-out-of-M game in this particular query. <i>N</i> numbers follows, those are your chosen number. You are to determine what is the probability of that number winning the lottery. Since the probabilities can be very low, output them in scientific notation: <i>a</i> x 10^<i>b</i> where <i>a</i> should be between 1.00000 and 9.99999, inclusive. Output <i>a</i> in 5 decimal places.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a man known as Mr. Bonus (Born at Binus), no one know his real name. One day, after miles of walk, he sat and took a rest. Accidentally, a board fell from sky and hit his head. He was very angry because he thought someone had intentionally thrown that board, but he did not see anyone around. So he thought that board is from God. He tried to look at that board and found a lot of puzzle shape like this:</p><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/46/4662a.jpg /><p>He thought that God want him to calculate how many different shapes are there in that board. Mr. Bonus: "This is very easy, I just need to open my BinusBerry to make a program to calculate it." But he thought that he should take a rest, so he called you to solve his problem.</p><p>You are about to count how many different shapes are there in the board. Two shapes are considered the same if they can be matched by rotating (90, 180, or 270 degree) and/or mirroring. These 8 shapes are considered as the same shape:</p><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/46/4662a.jpg /><p>You should output the number of different shapes and label the puzzles. The same puzzle should use the same label.

<p>There is a game production company that is going to develop a new adventure game. YouÂ’re very interested and join the recruitment phase. YouÂ’re being tested to solve this simulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each simulation there will be an <i>R</i> x <i>C</i> map with the following characters:</li>
<ul>
<li>'#' represents wall, hero can't move here.</li>
<li>'S' represents starting point of the hero.</li>
<li>'F' represents finish point, the game ends.</li>
<li>Number '1' to '9' represents the life point to be reduced if the hero moves here.</li>
<li>'E' represents enemy that the hero need to fight if the hero want to move here.</li>
<li>'I' represents item that will add 100 points to the hero's life force, become '0' after taken (no life force will be reduce to come back to this point).</li>
</ul>
<li>The hero has life force (<i>Lf</i>), Experience (<i>Exp</i>), Defend power (<i>Def</i>) and Strength (<i>Str</i>).</li>
<li>The hero will be given extra 1 (one) point for the strength and defend power for each 25 (twenty five) experience point gained by the hero.</li>
<li>Hero will die if <i>Lf</i> &lt;= 0.</li>
<li>Rules of the fight with enemy:</li>
<ul>
<li>Each enemy will have Strength, Life force and Experience.</li>
<li>The hero and the enemy will be given one chance to attack the other each turn start with the hero, until either the hero or the enemy die (life force &lt;= 0).</li>
<li>If the hero attacks the enemy, the enemy's life force will be decreased by the hero's strength.</li>
<li>If the enemy attacks the hero, the hero's life force will be decreased by the enemy's strength reduced by the hero's defend power.</li>
<li>The hero will be given the enemy's experience if the hero defeats the enemy.</li>
<li>After the enemy defeated, the place will become '0' (no life force will be reduce to come back to this point).</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>For each simulation, youÂ’re asked to print three paths, Lf and Exp to the finish point that give:</p>
<ol>
<li>The highest <i>Lf</i>.</li>
<li>The highest <i>Exp</i>. If thereÂ’s more than one highest <i>Exp</i>, choose the highest <i>Lf</i>.</li>
<li>The shortest way. If thereÂ’s more than one shortest way, choose the highest <i>Lf</i>.</li>

Denoting the strength, defend, experience and life force of the hero respectively. The next line contains <i>C</i> (3 &lt;= <i>C</i> &lt;= 20) and <i>R</i> (3 &lt;= <i>R</i> &lt;= 20) denoting the columns and rows of the map respectively. The next <i>R</i> lines contain the map as described above. The next lines contain the description of the enemy, <i>eStr</i> (0 &lt;= <i>eStr</i> &lt;=10), <i>eLf</i> (10 &lt;= <i>eLf</i> &lt;= 100) and <i>eExp</i> (1 &lt;= <i>eExp</i> &lt;= 25) denoting the enemy's strength, life force and experience to be gained if it dies respectively.

Your task is to build a spam detection module, based on the number of term "free" in an email.</p><p>The core of this detection module is a spam classifier, which is represented by two variables: <i>Low</i> and <i>High</i>. An email that contains <i>X</i> "free" words is classified by this module as a spam if <i>Low</i> &lt;= <i>X</i> &lt;= <i>High</i>, otherwise it is not.</p><p>To measure the goodness of a classifier, we introduce several information-retrieval terminologies:</p><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" border="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="center">Actual</td></tr><tr><td>Predicted</td><td><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" border="0" bgcolor="black"><tr bgcolor="white"><td width="70">&nbsp;</td><td width="70" align="center">Spam</td><td width="70" align="center">Not Spam</td></tr><tr bgcolor="white"><td>Spam</td><td align="center">TP</td><td align="center">FP</td></tr><tr bgcolor="white"><td>Not Spam</td><td align="center">FN</td><td align="center">TN</td></tr></table></td></tr></table><p>TP (true positive) is the number of emails which are truly predicted as spam; FN (false negative) is the number of emails which are wrongly predicted as non-spam, and so on.</p><p>The portion of emails that are correctly identified as spam is denoted as precision (P), which is formulated as P = TP / (TP + FP). The portion of spam emails that are successfully identified is denoted as recall (R), which is formulated as R = TP / (TP + FN). To balance between precision and recall, we use the F-measure which is formulated as F = 2 x P x R / (P + R). For example, when TP = 5, FP = 3, FN = 2, TN = 4, we have R = 5/7, P = 5/8, and F = 2/3.</p><p>When there is no spam, we can report all emails as non-spam with F = 1.0 (perfect classifier).</p><p>Our data mining team has manually analyzed several emails and labeled them as spam or non-spam.

The number of spam emails is: pos<sub>i</sub> = {1, 0, 2, 1}, and the number of non-spam emails is neg<sub>i</sub> = {2, 1, 0, 2}. The optimal classifier treats emails with number of term "free" between 2 and 3 as spam, with R = 3/4 and P = 3/5, resulting F = 2/3. Another way of producing optimal classifier is to consider emails with number of term "free" equals to 2 as spam.</p>

As the Martian scientists invented a new kind of aircraft, Martin is going to have a nightmare.<P>The new aircraft looks somewhat like a sphere with different radii according to the model. With the powerful engine, the aircraft can accelerate itself to a certain speed in no time, and travel in that speed and direction until stopped. Furthermore, its amazing braking system is able to stop the aircraft immediately.<P>Unfortunately, due to the global financial crisis, the Martian can't afford the navigation system of the aircraft. That leads to a serious problem: the aircrafts may hit each other while travelling.<P>Martin's airport is going to replace the old aircraft with the new ones. If any collision happens, Martin will lose his job. Martin has got the speed and radius of every aircraft, together with their travelling plans.

Bubble breaker is a popular game on mobile phone. It is simple but interesting. The 
gameboard consists of a screen of differently-colored bubbles arranged in a matrix. 
There are five different colors: red, blue, green, yellow and purple. The player then 
clicks on any two or more connecting same-colored bubbles to eliminate them from the 
matrix, earning an appropriate amount of points in the process. The more bubbles 
eliminated one time, the higher the points added to the player's score. More 
specifically, the rules of the game are as follows:

the player clears an entire bubble column, the columns on its left slide right and fill

<DD>The scoring of each bubble-breaking operation can be expressed in the formula

score. For example an elimination of 16 bubbles will result in 240 points (240=16(16-1)).

John likes the game very much. And he has worked out a simple strategy to win high scores 
for most cases. In his strategy, John assigns different priorities to bubbles with different 
colors. If there are more than one set of connected bubbles with different colors that can 
be broken in the gameboard, John always breaks red bubbles at first, and then green bubbles, 
then blue bubbles, then yellow bubbles, and finally purple bubbles. If there are multiple 
choices with the same color, John can always break the proper bubbles and achieve a final 
score as high as possible. Now the problem is, given a new bubble breaker game, what final 
score can John win using his strategy?

language patterns; each pattern can be treated as a string on English letters (only lower 
case). As a sub string, these patterns may appear more than one times in a large text 
string (also only lower case English letters).

Alice and Bob are fond of a new interesting game. In this game, they play by turns in a 
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Every node of the graph is assigned a non-negative integer 
at the beginning. Each round a player must choose a node having a positive integer and 
transfer 1 to one of its succeeding nodes, i.e. its integer decreases by 1 and certain 
succeeding node's integer increases by 1. Who cannot find such a node to transfer will 
lose, i.e. the integer is 0 in every node having at least 1 succeeding node. 

<P>
Before playing the game, they come to an agreement about the integer assignment. Alice 
plays first. To be fair, Bob is responsible for assigning an integer to each node. But 
there is a constraint: the sum of all integers must be a predetermined value that they 
both agree. 

<P>
Now, given the sum, Alice wonders how many distinct assignments which will 
prevent her from winning. Two assignments are different if there is one node assigned 
different integers in the two assignments. 

<P>
Alice and Bob are so smart that they can always find the best strategy.

``Paper cutting is the art of cutting paper designs." 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Chinese Paper Cutting or Jianzhi is the first type of papercutting design, since paper 
was invented by Cai Lun in the Eastern Han Dynasty in China. The art form later spread to 
other parts of the world with different regions adopting their own cultural styles. Because 
the cut outs are also used to decorate doors and windows, they are sometimes referred to 
``<SPAN  CLASS="textit">chu&#227;ng hu&#227;</SPAN>", meaning Window Flower." 
<DIV ALIGN="RIGHT">-WikiPedia

</BLOCKQUOTE> 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Alice is a fan of interesting Chinese paper cutting (ICPC). When she first saw it in her 
grandmother's house, she immediately fell in love with this art. And from then on, she 
began to collect various paper cutting designs and tried to create her own works as well. 
At first, she couldn't manipulate her scissors and often cut inappropriate parts. Sometimes, 
she even hurt herself. She had many beautiful designs in her mind, but she was unable to 
realize them. She was so disappointed for that. However, she didn't give up. She persisted 
in practicing, learning from books and experts. At last, she found a key feature of paper 
cutting. That is symmetry. 

<P>
Symmetry is very important for paper cutting. It not only beautifies the whole work but 
also makes the cutting process easy. Therefore, cutting each part of a work independently 
is not a good choice. Instead, it will be better to fold and cut alternately. 

<P>
Now Alice is experienced and works out a paper cutting process which is safe and easy. So 
she invents a machine that can perform paper cutting following her instructions. 

<P>
This machine has a wide foldable board and a coordinate system on the board. Before the 
machine runs, she puts a piece of rectangular paper on the board. Two edges of the paper 
accord with X-axis and y-axis respectively. X-axis is from left to right and y-axis is 
from top down. 

<P>
Then she starts up the machine and performs a paper cutting process by repeating two 
types of instructions: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<UL>
<LI><TT>fold</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>: 

<P>
To execute this instruction, the part of the board containing the point A will be folded 
onto the other part. So the point A will coincide with B after folding. Then, the folded 
part will come back to the original position.

<P>

</DIV>

<P>
As showed in figure 1, Sa is folded onto Sb to make A and B coincide, meanwhile, the paper 
is folded along the line l . Then, Sa is put back to the original position. But the folded 
area of the paper is left on Sb. 

<P>
In some cases, the paper may be completely within Sa. If so, the whole paper will be 
reversed and left on Sb. In contrast, the paper will be unchanged if it is completely 
within Sb. The folding is limited to be vertical or horizontal.

<P>
The machine is equipped with a small sharp knife. First, it will use the knife to cut the 
paper along the line segment <!-- MATH
 $A_{0} \ A_{1}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I><SUB>0</SUB>&nbsp;<I>A</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>. If there are multiple layers under 
<!-- MATH
 $A_{0} \ A_{1}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I><SUB>0</SUB>&nbsp;<I>A</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>, it will penetrate all of them. After that, it will continue to cut along 
the segment <!-- MATH
 $A_{1} \ A_{2}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I><SUB>1</SUB>&nbsp;<I>A</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> and then <!-- MATH

 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I><SUB>2</SUB>&nbsp;<I>A</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN>, etc. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> can be outside the paper. 
The machine will cut nothing if it finds the knife is outside the paper. 

<P>
Sometimes it may happen to cut along the joining line of two layers. The knife is so sharp 
that it will cut off them all the same.

 ALT="\epsfbox{p4673b.eps}">
</DIV>

<P>
If the paper is divided to several pieces after cutting, the machine will automatically get 
rid of all pieces but the one with the largest area (after unfolding). If there is a tie, 
it will keep the one containing the most top-left point in the original paper, i.e. the 
most left point in the most top horizontal line. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Finally, she unfolds the paper and sees a fantastic design. 

<P>
For some complex designs, she is not sure whether her instructions will exactly make what 
she wants. She doesn't want to waste paper. So she needs you to write a program that can 
simulate her instructions and tell her the final design. Given her instructions, your job 
is to print the final design.

<P>Tired of all the geometry problems in programming contests, you decided to run away from programming contests and get into game development -- without realizing that there were more geometry problems waiting for you! You thought up of a nice two player 2-D arcade game which works as follows -- the first player throws a triangular metal piece in a particular direction. The second player then throws another triangular metal piece with the aim of hitting the first player's piece. You're very confident that the game will be a worldwide hit -- except that you don't know how to decide whether the two pieces will collide.<P>You've decided to get rid of your mental block and solve this problem at any cost. At the instant that the second player throws his piece, you store the position and velocity of both the pieces, and you refer to this time as 0. Your game does not allow the pieces to already be in collision at this time. You now want to compute the time at which the two pieces will collide.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The first line contains <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>, the number of test cases.

NK, India's lead racing driver, inspected the new race track being  prepared for India's 
first F1 race. In his notebook, he represented the  race track as consisting of a series 
of straight lines joined at  vertices. Each straight line represents a straight piece of 
the track  between successive corners and he noted down these distances. Each  vertex 
represents a corner and based on the grip of his team's car, he  noted down the maximum 
speed at which each corner could be taken. At  speeds less than or equal to this speed, 
when the driver turns the  steering wheel, the direction of velocity changes 
instantaneously  without any loss in magnitude. 

<P>
The track is cyclic and has <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> corners, numbered 0 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> - 1</SPAN>. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> represents 
the maximum speed at which corner <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> can be taken. The circuit also has <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> straight line 
segments, numbered 0 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> - 1</SPAN>, between these corners. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> represents the distance between 
corner <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> and corner <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> + 1</SPAN>. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>N-1</SUB></SPAN> represents the distance between corner <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> - 1</SPAN> and corner 0.  
Given the maximum acceleration(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>) and maximum deceleration under braking(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>) of the car, NK wants 
to know what is the fastest lap time  possible if the car starts at rest at corner0. Lap time is 
measured as the time taken to once again cross corner 0. When corner 0  is crossed at the 
end of the lap, the speed of the car should be low  enough that it can be brought to a halt 
safely by travelling along the circuit while braking continuously. (NK's team is not so cash 
filled that they can crash a car every lap!)

Being a very quirky person, you've modeled your large neighbourhood as  a set of numbered 
junctions and two-way roads connecting these  junctions. Somewhat disturbingly, you've 
actually measured the length  of each road in nanometers! Whenever you take a trip from 
one junction  to another, you always note down the lengths of the longest road and  the 
shortest road in your trip and then compute the difference between  the two. One day, 
before you set out on a trip, you're overwhelmed by a  strong desire to find out what 
the lowest possible difference is among  all trips that have the same starting and ending 
junction as yours. Of  course, computing all this on paper will take you ages and your 
trip is  a little urgent (you must leave in the next 5 hours), so you decide to  write 
a program.

<P>ABC University has <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> departments. Each department is assigned a department number. There are many students in each department. The university assigns roll numbers to each student such that the number is divisible by the department number. For example if department number is 5, the students can only get roll numbers 5, 10, 15, etc. The purpose is to identify the department of a student easily from his roll number. So if a number is divisible by more than one department number, then that number will not be assigned to any student (so that there will not be any ambiguity). For example if we have departments 5 and 7, then 35, 70, 105, etc are not used because they are divisible by both numbers.<P>Everything was going fine until one day, someone hacked into the University database and erased the roll number column in the students table!

My brother and I love pizza. My brother ordered a pizza today with a  number of toppings. 
Some of those toppings I love, like mushrooms,  while there are some others that I hate, 
like olives. Even among the  toppings I like (or the ones that I don't like), I like some 
more than  the other, depending on the amount.

<P>
Now my brother will let me take a wedge of any size from the pizza.  This means I am allowed 
to make two cuts from the center of the pizza  to its circumference, and can keep one of the 
two resulting pieces. If  either cut goes through a topping, the entire topping belongs to 
that  piece which contains the centre of the topping. I am not allowed to cut  exactly 
through the centre of a topping. Each topping will thus remain  entirely on one of the 
pieces. I would like to cut and choose the best  piece possible for myself.

Vito was involved in a lot of businesses in different areas of New York -- from simple olive 
oil to more dangerous products. Competition was literally cut-throat, and Vito was at his 
most vulnerable while  travelling. So he decided that some of the roads that he travelled 
on  had to be ``sanitized" so that he could travel between any two of his  areas 
using only sanitized roads. Since sanitization was an extremely  costly process, his 
Consigliere decided to sanitize the minimum number  of roads needed.

<P>
All was fine until Vito grew old and decided to hand the reins over to  his son Michael. 
However, his Capos weren't too happy about this as  they wanted a part of the business 
too. So it was decided that Michael would get to pick exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> areas for himself 
while the Capos would keep the rest. Michael worked out the business value of each area 
(including some loss-making areas). He now wants to pick his <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> areas such that the 
total business  value is maximized and he can travel between any two of his areas using  
only sanitized roads. Of course, during his travel he does not want to  go through an 
area that is not his. You've been Michael's associate for  a long time and you see your 
chance to impress him and become a full  member by telling him what the highest possible 
value is. Just to prove  you're no fluke, you also want to tell him exactly how many 
ways there  are of achieving this. (No big numbers for the Boss, so you will only  tell 
him the remainder this number leaves when divided by 1000000007).

The game is played by crawling from tile to tile collecting the raisins on some tiles that are visited.

The catch is, they have to crawl and collect raisins according to the following rules:<P><UL><LI>start in the northwest corner, end in the southeast corner, </LI><LI>only the following two moves are allowed: move south (not southeast or southwest) to the neighboring tile, or move east (not northeast or southeast) to the neighboring tile, and </LI><LI>collect raisins from a tile only if you are changing direction on that tile.

One of Buster's favorite pastimes (he usually does this while waiting 
for his dog biscuits to bake) is playing the game of vertical sums. To 
play the game, Buster writes all the numbers from 1 to 19, in order, 
into a grid. He places the numbers into the grid by starting at the 
cell in the upper left corner of the grid and works his way cell by 
cell, from left to right, across the row. Once he finishes the top 
row he moves to the row immediately below it and repeats the process. 
As he works his way through the grid he places numbers into some of 
the cells he visits along the way. Single digit numbers fit into 
single cells; however, two-digit numbers are placed into two adjacent 
cells in the same row. Other then to represent a two-digit number, 
digits cannot share an edge of a cell, horizontally or vertically. 
An example of a correctly filled grid is shown below:

<P>
Buster's friend Arnie loves arithmetic and after Buster fills in one 
of his grids, Arnie computes the sum of the numbers in each column 
(in the grid above Arnie's sums appear below the grid in the row that 
is shaded gray). One day over dog biscuits Arnie suggests to Buster 
that another way to play the game would be to start out with the sums 
and then fill in the grid, using the same rules as before, so that 
sum of the digits in each column match the sums. 

<P>
Heidi and Sammy, while waiting for the next set of dog biscuits, 
overhear this conversation. They decide that it is possible to write a 
program that, given the size of the grid and the sums, fills in the 
grid if possible. Once they settle on an algorithm they realize that 
between napping, protecting the house, and walking, they do not have 
time to write the program. So, they decide to outsource the project 
to you.

See if you can make it off the ship before drowning!<p>The schematics of the ship can be described by a series of locations (e.g., cabins, lounges, and various other rooms) and paths (e.g., hallways, elevators, Christmas trees, and stairs) between the locations (as well as the time it takes to travel along these paths). You must determine the shortest amount of time it takes to get from your starting location to the rescue team. Unfortunately, there are a series of explosions occurring on the ship that cause certain locations <b>and</b> the paths to and from those locations to flood, and if you are in these locations or paths when the explosions occur, you will drown. Also, you cannot travel through a location once it is flooded. Note that if you reach a non-flooded location at the same exact time as the path you were previously on is flooded, or if you reach the rescue team at the same exact time its location is flooded, you would not drown at that time (i.e. you "win" ties).<p><b>Input:</b><p>Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of data sets. Each data set will consist of a series of lines:<p><ol class="input"><li>The first line will contain integers "<i>L</i> <i>S</i> <i>R</i>", with <i>L</i> (1 &le; <i>L</i> &le; 100) specifying the number of locations in this data set, <i>S</i> (1 &le; <i>S</i> &le; <i>L</i>) specifying your starting location, and <i>R</i> (1 &le; <i>R</i> &le; <i>L</i>) specifying the location of the rescue team.</li> <li>The next <i>L</i> lines will contain information for each of the locations in ascending order, starting with the first line containing information for location 1.

<p><b>Introduction:</b><p>While sitting in traffic on I-35 one day, you look up at the pickup in front of you and notice the word "YO" staring back at you from the tailgate. After a bit of closer investigation, you realize that the witty driver of the truck is driving a Toyota and has simply painted over the "TO" and "YA". As the traffic continues to sit, you beging to daydream and wonder how well this technique would work for other words.<p>Given a starting word and a dictionary, determine how many ways you could "paint over" combinations of letters in the starting word and end up with one or more correctly spelled words. If a "paint over" combination produces multiple words (including the same word appearing at multiple locations in the starting word), then it's counted separately from the combinations that produce individual words. Multiple words need not be separated, and a single word may contain embedded spaces. For example, if the dictionary contains "he" and "vet" and the starting word is "CHEVROLET", then four possible combinations can be produced:<p><pre>
   .HE......
   .H.....E.
   ...V...ET
   .HEV...ET
</pre>However, multiple words may not overlap each other in any way. For example, the starting word "CHEVROLET" can form individual words "hoe" and "vet", but the combination of both words would not be valid.<p><b>Input:</b><p>The input will begin with a line containing a single integer <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of data sets. Each data set will begin with a line of the form "<i>X</i> &nbsp;<i>S</i>". The integer <i>X</i> (1 &le; X &le; 200000) indicates the number of words in the dictionary for this data set. The string <i>S</i> specifies the starting word and will contain at least 1 character but no more than 30. The next <I>X</i> lines will be the dictionary for the data set and will each contain one word that is also at least 1 and at most 30 characters long.<p>Note that the starting word will always be in upper case, while the words in the dictionary may be mixed case. Neither the starting word nor the words in the dictionary will contain any embedded spaces, and the dictionary will not contain any duplicate words. And no, the dictionary is not guaranteed to be in any particular order.<p><p><b>Output:</b><p>For each data set in the input, output a line containing a single integer representing how many ways you could "paint over" combinations of letters in the starting word and end up with one or more correctly spelled words. At least one letter in the starting word has to be painted over to count; if the dictionary contains the same exact word as the starting word then, then this word would <i>not</i> be counted. You may assume that the total number of combinations per data set will not exceed 300000.<p><b>Sample Input:</b><p><pre>

Given a set of relationships, you wish to determine how much of a friend or enemy people are, represented by a "total relationship score".<p><b>Input:</b><p>Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of data sets.

For example, if a line contained "<tt>Bob F E N</tt>", this would indicate that Bob is friends with the person on the first line of the relationship matrix, enemies with the person on the second line of the relationship matrix, and has a neutral relationship with the person on the third line of the relationship matrix. Note that a person will always have a neutral relationship with themselves and that relationships are bi-directional (e.g., if Bob is a friend with George, then George is a friend with Bob).</li> <li>The last line in the data set will contain a single name for which the total relationship scores between that person and every other person are to be computed. </li></ol><p><b>Output:</b><p>For each data set, print a single line containing the total relationship scores between the name given in the final line of the data set and every other person in the data set, with each score separated by a single space and in the same order that the names appear in the input. The total relationship score between two people is the sum total of <i>all</i> the relationship scores of direct <i>and</i> indirect relationships between them.

Indirect relationships are those in which a cycle-free path of two or more relationships can be traced between two people, with none of those relationships being of the neutral variety (e.g., an "enemy of an enemy" or an "enemy of a friend of an enemy").

<style type="text/css">ol{margin-bottom:1em}</style><p><b>Introduction:</b><p>In the game of poker, each player holds 5 playing cards in their hand. At the end of the final round each player reveals their cards, and the player with the most valuable hand wins the game. Your goal is to write a program that reads in the poker hands of each player, determines their relative worth, and then prints them back out in sorted order from most to least valuable.<p>Poker is played with a deck of 52 cards, evenly divided into 4 suits: <i>hearts</i> (&hearts;), <i>spades</i> (&spades;), <i>diamonds</i> (&diams;), and <i>clubs</i> (&clubs;). Each suit has 13 cards, and each card within the suit has a unique rank that determines the relative worth of the card. From highest to lowest (i.e. from most to least valuable) these ranks are: <i>ace</i> (high), <i>king</i>, <i>queen</i>, <i>jack</i>, <i>10</i>, <i>9</i>, <i>8</i>, <i>7</i>, <i>6</i>, <i>5</i>, <i>4</i>, <i>3</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>ace</i> (low). Although only one <i>ace</i> card exists within each suit, and it is usually ranked as the highest card, under some circuimstances the <i>ace</i> card will be treated as the lowest. The suit itself has no bearing on the worth of the card and is only used to determine which category a particular hand belongs to (in particular the <i>flush</i> and <i>straight flush</i> categories; see below).<p>Each poker hand can be classified into one of nine categories depending on the combination of cards within that hand. A higher category hand always beats any other lower category hand regardless of the individual card ranks within either hand. If both hands belong to the same category, then the individual card ranks are used to decide which hand is more valuable. Note that each category has slightly different rules about how the individual card ranks break the tie. Also note that the category classification does not depend on the permutation of cards within a hand (i.e. the position of individual cards within a hand does not matter). The possible hand categories are listed below from most to least valuable:<ol><li><i>Straight Flush</i><br>All cards are of the same suit and have sequential rank. Between two straight flushes, the hand with the highest card wins. Note that the low ace rule applies to this category when a hand consists of the following cards: <i>5</i>, <i>4</i>, <i>3</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>ace</i> (i.e. the <i>ace</i> has the lowest rank in this hand and the <i>5</i> has the highest). Example:<br>A&hearts; K&hearts; Q&hearts; J&hearts; 10&hearts; beats K&spades; Q&spades; J&spades; 10&spades; 9&spades; and 6&diams; 5&diams; 4&diams; 3&diams; 2&diams; beats 5&clubs; 4&clubs; 3&clubs; 2&clubs; A&clubs;.<p></li><li><i>Four Of a Kind</i><br>Four cards of the same rank (i.e. a quad) with a fifth card of a different rank. Between two hands in this category, the hand containing the higher ranking quad wins. If both quads have equally ranked cards, then the hand with a higher unmatched card wins. Example:<br>8&clubs; 8&hearts; 8&spades; 8&diams; Q&clubs; beats 2&clubs; 2&hearts; 2&spades; 2&diams; A&diams; and 4&clubs; 4&hearts; 4&spades; 4&diams; A&hearts; beats 4&clubs; 4&hearts; 4&spades; 4&diams; J&hearts;.<p></li><li><i>Full House</i><br>Three matching cards of one rank plus two matching cards (i.e. a pair) of a different rank. Between two full houses, the hand with a higher ranked group of three wins. If both groups of three have equal ranking, then the hand with the higher ranked pair wins. Example:<br>4&diams; 4&hearts; 4&clubs; Q&spades; Q&clubs; beats 3&clubs; 3&spades; 3&hearts; K&diams; K&hearts; and Q&hearts; Q&diams; Q&spades; J&diams; J&clubs; beats Q&hearts; Q&diams; Q&spades; 10&hearts; 10&spades;.<p></li><li><i>Flush</i><br>All cards are of the same suit. Between two flushes, the hand with the highest card wins. If the highest card in both hands is the same rank, then the second highest card decides the winner, and so on. Example:<br>Q&diams; 8&diams; K&diams; J&diams; 2&diams; beats J&spades; 10&spades; 9&spades; 2&spades; 8&spades; and Q&hearts; J&hearts; 9&hearts; 8&hearts; 3&hearts; beats Q&clubs; J&clubs; 7&clubs; 3&clubs; 2&clubs;.<p></li><li><i>Straight</i><br>All cards have sequential rank. Between two straights the hand with the highest card wins. Note that the low ace rule applies to this category when a hand consists of the following cards: <i>5</i>, <i>4</i>, <i>3</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>ace</i>. Example:<br>Q&spades; J&clubs; 10&spades; 9&hearts; 8&diams; beats 7&hearts; 6&diams; 5&hearts; 4&spades; 3&diams; and A&clubs; K&spades; Q&clubs; J&clubs; 10&hearts; beats 5&diams; 4&hearts; 3&clubs; 2&spades; A&hearts;.<p></li><li><i>Three Of a Kind</i><br>Three matching cards of the same rank plus two unmatched cards (known as the <i>kickers</i>) whose rank doesn't match each other or the group of three. Between two such hands, the hand with a higher group of three wins. If both groups of three have equal rank, than the hand with the highest kicker wins (if the highest kicker cards in both hands are equal than compare the other two kickers). Example:<br>7&hearts; 7&clubs; 7&spades; J&diams; 10&spades; beats 4&hearts; 4&spades; 4&diams; 7&clubs; Q&diams; and 8&spades; 8&hearts; 8&diams; 3&spades; 6&diams; beats 8&clubs; 8&diams; 8&spades; 3&diams; 5&hearts;.<p></li><li><i>Two Pair</i><br>Two matching cards of one rank, two matching cards of a different rank (which match each other but not the first pair), and a fifth card (the <i>kicker</i>) whose rank does not match either pair. Between hands in this category, the hand with the higher ranked pair wins. If the highest pairs in each hand have equal ranking, then compare using the other pairs in each hand. If both pairs in one hand match both pairs in the other hand, then the hand with the highest kicker (the fifth unmatched card) wins. Example:<br>K&hearts; K&clubs; 3&diams; 3&clubs; 2&spades; beats J&diams; J&hearts; Q&spades; Q&clubs; K&spades; and 8&spades; 8&clubs; 5&diams; 5&clubs; 3&hearts; beats 8&hearts; 8&diams; 4&spades; 4&diams; 3&clubs;.<p></li><li><i>One Pair</i><br>One matching pair of cards with the same rank, plus three cards (<i>kickers</i>) whose rank matches neither the pair nor each other. Between these categories, the hand with the highest pair wins. If both hands have equally ranked pairs, then compare using the highest unmatched kicker card (or second highest, or third highest). Example:<br>4&hearts; 4&diams; 8&hearts; 10&diams; J&spades; beats 3&hearts; 3&spades; Q&clubs; 8&hearts; 2&diams; and 9&spades; 9&diams; 10&hearts; J&hearts; 4&clubs; beats 9&hearts; 9&clubs; J&spades; 7&hearts; 8&diams;.<p></li><li><i>High Card</i><br>If a poker hand does not fall into any other category above, then it is classified as this category. In other words, each card is of a different rank, all the cards are not of the same suit, and are not in ranked sequence. Between two hands in this category, the hand with the highest ranked card wins (or second highest, or third highest, and so on). Example:<br>8&clubs; K&spades; 3&hearts; J&diams; 2&hearts; beats 10&hearts; J&spades; 8&clubs; 7&hearts; 6&diams; and A&spades; 3&diams; 4&hearts; Q&hearts; J&clubs; beats K&spades; 8&clubs; Q&hearts; 10&diams; 9&hearts;.<p></li></ol><p><b>Input:</b><p>Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of data sets.

Each playing card is described by a two character string, and a poker hand consists of five such strings separated by spaces:<ol><li>The first character specifies the card's rank as follows:<ul><li>The letters &ldquo;<tt>A</tt>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<tt>K</tt>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<tt>Q</tt>&rdquo;, and &ldquo;<tt>J</tt>&rdquo; respectively specifying <i>ace</i>, <i>king</i>, <i>queen</i>, and <i>jack</i>. </li><li>A &ldquo;<tt>0</tt>&rdquo; (number zero) specifying a card of rank <i>10</i>. </li><li>The numbers &ldquo;<tt>2</tt>&rdquo; through &ldquo;<tt>9</tt>&rdquo; specifying a card of the same numeric rank. </li></ul></li><li>The second charater gives the card's suit with &ldquo;<tt>H</tt>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<tt>S</tt>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<tt>D</tt>&rdquo;, and &ldquo;<tt>C</tt>&rdquo; respectively specifying <i>hearts</i>, <i>spades</i>, <i>diamonds</i>, and <i>clubs</i>. </li></ol>You may assume that in the input the same card (i.e. having the same rank and suit) will never appear more than once within a single poker hand.<p><b>Output:</b><p>For each data set in the input, output the heading &ldquo;<tt>Data Set #<i>k</i></tt>&rdquo; where <i>k</i> is 1 for the first data set, 2 for the second, etc. Following the heading, output the poker hands (one per line) from the input in sorted order from the most to least valuable.

<p><b>Introduction:</b><p>Many tabletop role-playing games (RPGs), such as a rather famous one involving dragons and dungeons, require the use of dice to simulate various random events in the game. Unlike most regular board games that use six-sided dice, RPGs typically require the use of several polyhedral dice with 4, 6, 8, 12, or 20 sides. Often times the player is required to make a skill check. This involves rolling a set of dice, adding the individual dice rolls together, and then comparing the sum against a pre-determined <i>target value</i>. If the total dice roll is equal to or greater than the target value, then the skill check is considered successful.<p>When a RPG requires a roll of the dice, it will use a <i>dice notation</i> to indicate how many and what kind of dice to roll. For example, "1d4+2d8" would direct the player to roll three dice, one 4-sided die plus two 8-sided ones, and then to add the results of all three dice rolls together. Sometimes the player is required to add or subtract a modifier (i.e. a constant integer) to the total sum of the dice roll. Using the dice notation, a +3 modifier (i.e. a bonus) might be specified as "1d4+2d8+3", while a negative modifier like &minus;5 (i.e. a penalty) might be specified as "1d4&minus;5+2d8". Note that the faces of each die are numbered starting with 1 and going up to the number of sides, so that every face has a unique number. For example, the faces on a 4 sided die would be numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.<p>Because failing a skill check usually results in something bad happening to the player's character, it's important to know what the chances are of a particular skill check succeeding. To help in this regard, you decided to write a program that reads in a target value along with a dice roll expression, and then prints the probability of passing that skill check.<p><b>Input:</b><p>Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of data sets. Each data set consists of a single line of the form "<i>T</i> <i>X</i>", where <i>T</i> (0 &le; <i>T</i> &le; 100) is the target value, and <i>X</i> is a string containing the dice notation. <i>X</i> will not contain any spaces.<p>The dice notation <i>X</i> will contain one or more <i>terms</i> separated by either a plus "+" or minus "&minus;" sign. Each term can be either an integer <i>M</i> (1 &le; <i>M</i> &le; 10) or an expression of the form "<i>N</i>d<i>S</i>" where <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 6) and <i>S</i> is an integer equal to 4, 6, 8, 12, or 20. The total number of dice to roll for any given expression will not exceed 6.<p><p><b>Output:</b><p>For each data set, print a single line with the probability that the given dice roll will be equal to or higher than the target value <i>T</i>. If the target value cannot be achieved, then print the number zero (0). If the target value can always be achieved with every possible dice roll (e.g. due to modifiers), then print the number one (1). Otherwise, print the probability as a fraction reduced to its lowest terms.<p><b>Sample Input:</b><p><pre>

<P>
Parlay wagering offers sports bettors the opportunity to win a large sum of money from a 
small initial wager. A parlay wager is a combination of individual independent wagers that 
only pays if no individual wager loses. The payout from each wager is applied or ``parlayed" 
to the next wager in turn. If any individual wager loses, the bettor receives nothing. 
If any individual wager is a tie or ``push", that wager is effectively ignored, reducing the 
ultimate payout. 

<P>
The sports book quotes the payout rate for an individual wager as a ``money line", a 
non-zero integer in the range -2000 to 2000. To compute the payout for a successful 
wager, the money line is converted to a decimal multiplier as follows: if the money line 
is positive, it is divided by 100 to obtain the multiplier. If the money line is negative, 
the absolute value is divided into 100 to obtain the multiplier. The multiplier is always 
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">truncated</SPAN> to three digits after the decimal point. The wager is multiplied by this 
multiplier to determine the amount won. The amount won is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">truncated</SPAN> to the cent (the 
sports book keeps the fractional cents). 

<P>
Consider the following example for a five-way parlay wager:

<P>You now work for a puzzle company. They have a puzzle they call a <SPAN CLASS="textit">Word Ladder</SPAN>. A solver starts with a given starting word, and makes changes one letter at a time until s/he reaches a target word, with no word in the chain appearing more than once. There are three ways to take a single step from one word to another:<P><UL><LI>Change one letter </LI><LI>Add one letter </LI><LI>Remove one letter </LI></UL><P>So, it's one step from COT to CAT, one step from CAT to SCAT, and one step from SCAT to SAT.<P><P><BR>Here's a word ladder from COT to SCAT:<P><P><BR>COT <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4705img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> CAT <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4705img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> SAT <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4705img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> SCAT<P><P><BR>Here's another word ladder from COT to SCAT:<P><P><BR>COT <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4705img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> CAT <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4705img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"></SPAN> SCAT<P><P><BR>The length of a word ladder is the number of words in it, so the examples above show a word ladder of length 4, and one of length 3.

<P>During this economic crisis time, Jack has started an incredible new business related to air travel, a parking-lot for airplane. He bought a very large land to park airplanes. However the land is very narrow, so that the only way airplanes can go in or go out of the parking lot must be in the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">Last-In First-Out</SPAN> fashion (see picture below). He only has spaces in the parking lot so he <SPAN CLASS="textbf">cannot</SPAN> take some airplane at the end out so that other airplanes can move.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="677" HEIGHT="115" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4712.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4712.eps}"></DIV><P>Because of the limitation of the parking lot, it is not possible to accommodate all requests for parking.

<P>Elias code can be used to efficiently encode positive integers when there is no prior information about the cardinality of the integers to be encoded and it is known that the probability of getting a large integer is smaller than or equal to the probability of getting a small integer. <SPAN CLASS="textbf">For practical reasons, however, in this contest we do pose a limit on the size of the input integers. For the same reason we restrict the input integer to be greater than 1.</SPAN><P>Elias developed three variants of the code: the Elias gamma, Elias delta, and Elias omega coding methods. This problem presents the Elias gamma and Elias omega methods and calls for implementing the Elias omega code. The following is a <SPAN CLASS="textbf">background</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="textbf">definition</SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="textbf">illustration</SPAN> of the problem.<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Background</SPAN><P>Suppose that Alice wants to transmit a positive integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> to Bob through a binary channel and let <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4713img1.png ALT="$ \beta$">(<I>n</I>)</SPAN> stand for the binary representation of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>.

<P>A very important aspect of web portals is customer reviews. The customers can rate any product in the web portal. Generally, a customer can rate a product from one star to five star. Based on the rating of all the customers the average customer rating for a product is shown. Look at the figure to get a clear idea.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="700" HEIGHT="196" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4715.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4715.eps}"></DIV><P>For example if three customers rate a product as 3 star, 4 star and 4 star respectively then the average rating will be (3+4+4)/3 = 3.67 (Rounded to two digits after the decimal point). In the figure on the left 847 customers have rated a product and 597, 189, 26, 11 and 24 customers have rated the product as 5 star, 4 star, 3 star, 2 star and 1 star respectively. So the average rating is:<P><P></P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay"><IMG WIDTH="348" HEIGHT="56" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4715.png ALT="$\displaystyle {\frac{{597 \times 5 + 189 \times 4 + 26 \times 3 + 11 \times 2 + 24 \times 1}}{{847}}}$"> = 4.56316411</DIV><P></P>(Rounded to eight digits after the decimal point).<P>Most web portals display the total number of people who have rated the product (As more people rates the product the more reliable the rating is) but do not display the numeric value of the average rating. In the web portal of warzone (A renowned web portal) the total number of customers that have rated a product (In the figure above the total 847 customers have rated the product) and the average rating is stored in two different tables. The average rating is stored, rounded to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="MATH">0 &lt; <I>n</I> &lt; 9</SPAN>) digits after the decimal point 
so its value is not always the exact average  value. Unfortunately, the table that stored 
the total number of people that rated different products  somehow got corrupted. All 
information available in the database now is the average rating  (rounded to at most eight 
digits after the decimal point). They do not want to lose the huge  number of customer 
ratings they have received throughout 10-Â­15 years but also they cannot  cheat with their 
customers by guessing the number of raters or voters. So from the average rating  they 
want to determine the minimum possible number of people that rated that product. You  
have to help them find it out by writing a program.

You will be given the initial coordinates of the sticks that are placed on the grid. You will 
also be  given   the   coordinates   of   the   cells   that   are   blocked.   In   each   
move   you   can   do   one   of   the  followings:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Select one stick and throw it out. 
</LI>
<LI>Select one stick and rotate it 60 degrees clockwise/anti-clockwise about one of 
the end points. 
</LI>
<LI>Select one stick and push it along the length of the stick.

The sticks can never occupy a cell that is blocked. However, two sticks can occupy the

You   are   going   to   buy   a   house   and   hence  communicated   with   a   real

<P>
The real estate 
company has a rectangular shaped land  of width <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I></SPAN> and height <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I></SPAN>. They are using co-Â­ordinate  
system   for   measuring   lands.   <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(0, 0)</SPAN> is   the   lower   left  corner of their 
land and any point which has distance <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> from lower edge of the land and distance <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> 
from left  edge of the land is known as <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>)</SPAN> in the co-Â­ordinate  system. 

<P>
The real estate company has already built some houses in that piece of land. All of them are  
rectangular shaped and their edges are parallel to edges of the main land. The location 
of a house  can be addressed by four integers <!-- MATH
 $x_{1}, y_{1}, x_{2}, y_{2}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>. Where 
<!-- MATH

<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>1</SUB>)</SPAN> is the lower left corner and <!-- MATH
 $(x_{2}, y_{2})$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>2</SUB>)</SPAN> upper right corner of the house. 

<P>
The special offer is  that  you can choose any rectangular  shaped region that  contains  
exactly one house with any amount of adjacent open space. You may not have enough money 
to  afford open space and choose to buy only the region that a house occupies. If you 
have enough  money, you can keep open space in front of your house for gardening!  

<P>
But still there are some restrictions. For the ease of their future use of rest of their 
land  you can only choose a rectangular shaped region and the edges of which are parallel 
to the edges  of the main land. The corners of your selected region should be integer 
coordinates. It can be (3,  2) but cannot be (3.5, 2). You cannot chose a region for which 
part of a house is inside the region  and another part of that house is outside the 
region. You cannot choose a region having more  than   one   house  and a  region  
having  no  house.  How   many  ways  you  can  choose your   land  following the above rules?

In a science laboratory, scientists found a new kind of tiny lifeforms and named them  
``synnergs". Until now, few knowledge about synnergs are known. Some of these knowledge 
are  as follow.  

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>There are more than one types of synnerg.  
</LI>
<LI>Any new born synnerg have the same lifetime.  
</LI>
<LI>Two synnergs (of certain types) can extend their lifetimes by unifying themselves  
together which will also transform them into a new target synnerg. The lifetime of  
this   new   target   is   the   summation   of   both   sources'   lifetimes   
multiplied   with   an  amplification factor. The type of this new target may vary 
from its sources.   From  many experiments, scientists found a set of rules to describe 
the unification of each  synnerg pair . Some of these rules can be shown as the 
following table.

<LI>When scientists arrange two or more of new born synnergs into a sequence, each  synnerg 
in this sequence will try to unify itself with the one on its left or its right (and  
make the sequence shorter). This unification process will continue again and again

also affect  the lifetime of each unified synnerg.

In the first example, at the first step there is a sequence of 4 new born synnergs 
``<TT>a a b b</TT>" where  their lifetimes are ``1 1 1 1" respectively. In the second step, these 
synnergs unify themselves into  a sequence of two synnergs ``<TT>aa</TT>[a a] <TT>bb</TT>[b b]" 
(using rule no.1 and 3) where <TT>aa</TT>'s lifetime is  <!-- MATH
 $2=(1+1)\ast 1$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">2 = (1 + 1) <TT>*</TT> 1</SPAN> and <TT>bb</TT>'s 
lifetime is <!-- MATH
 $6=(1+1) \ast 3$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">6 = (1 + 1) <TT>*</TT> 3</SPAN>. In the third step, ``<TT>aa bb</TT>" unify themselves into 
``<TT>x</TT>"[aa  bb] (using rule no. 4) where its lifetime is <!-- MATH
 $16=(6+2)\ast 2$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">16 = (6 + 2) <TT>*</TT> 2</SPAN>. 

<P>
In the second example, at the first step, the beginning 
sequence is the same sequence in the first  example. But they alternatively unify 
themselves into ``<TT>AA</TT>[a a] <TT>bb</TT>[b b]" (using rule no.2 and 3  instead) where their 
lifetimes are <!-- MATH
 $34=(1+1)\ast 17$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">34 = (1 + 1) <TT>*</TT> 17</SPAN> and <!-- MATH
 $6(1+1) \ast 3$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">6(1 + 1) <TT>*</TT> 3</SPAN> respectively. This sequence is also  
the final sequence which means that it is unable to unify furthermore but it is not a completely  
unified sequence. However, this alternative final sequence has longer life time comparing 
to the  final sequence in the first example. 

<P>
The third and fourth example also show the alternative ways of unifying the sequence 
``<TT>a c a c</TT>".  Please be notify that each rule is not sensitive to the order of its sources.

The scientists would like you to create a program that can find all highest lifetime 
synnergs that  can be created by unifying a given sequence of newborn synnergs. The 
solution may not always  be the one that is completely unified. Only part or sub-Â­sequence 
unification is also acceptable.

In Nowhere town, people use ``coin and slot" as their money. There are 2 types of coins 
called size1 and size2. Size2 coin is twice the thickness of size1. People stack their 
coins in slots and  use them as money. There are many size of slots. The slot of size <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> 
is able to stack up <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> size1  coins. Only filled-Â­up slot is considered as legal money. 
The value of each filled-Â­up slot is the  distinct ways its can stack coins inside. For 
example, for size-Â­1 slot, there is only one way to  stack a single size1 coin inside. 
For size-Â­2 slot, there are 2 ways to stack two size1 coins or one  size2  coin  inside. 
And for size-Â­5 slot, there are 8 ways to stack coins inside, which can  be  illustrated as 
follow: 1 1 1 1 1, 1 1 1 2, 1 1 2 1, 1 2 1 1, 2 1 1 1, 1 2 2, 2 1 2, 2 2 1. So the value  
of   filled   up slot  with  size-Â­1,  size-Â­2  and size-Â­5 are  1,  2 and  8  (monetary)  units  
respectively  (regardless of the type of coins or the ways they are stacked).

Mr. Thinktwice is an owner of a grocery store in this town. He noticed that customers are 
likely  to go to the shop that can return the (money) change in the form that suits their 
customer. And  from his little survey, he found that most customers would like to get 
their amount of change in  the form according to these 2 simple constraints.    

<P>

<P>
<BR>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.</DT>
<DD>The number of slots is minimum.    
</DD>
<DT>2.</DT>
<DD>The size of each slot must be different from each other by at least 2. -This means that customers does not want any slots with the same size and it will be
easier for them to distinguish these differences if the sizes are not too close. 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
So Mr. Thinktwice ask you to write a program that can give him a series of slot sizes for 
a given  amount of change according to the previous constraints. Moreover, the series 
must be sorted in  descending order. For more specific, any amount of change can be 
written in this formula.

Crimes in city of Megacity are going high. To fight the crimes, the authorities have 
created a  highway patrol. The city consists of a number of one-Â­way roads. At the ends 
of each road, there  is a base station for the patrol troops. Each base station has a 
number of troops. At the beginning,  each station sends a troop along all the outgoing 
highways from that station. The troop patrols the  highway and whenever it reaches the 
station on the other side of the highway, it waits there, and  the troop that has been 
waiting there the most, is sent along the highway that has not been  patrolled the 
longest time.  

<P>
Soon, they faced some difficulties, cause, the frequency of patrolling a highway is more 
and  more dependent on the number of highways that started and ended at the base station. 
If the  number of highways started at a base station is more than the number of highways 
ended there,  the roads are patrolled less frequently. And if, no highways end at some 
base station, then, the  highways started from there, will not be patrolled more than once.  

<P>
In   this   situation,   the   highway   patrol   decided   to   remove   some   highways   
from   the   patrolling  schedule, so that, at each base station, the number of highways 
started and ended at any base  station will be equal. The rest of the highways will be 
monitored using video surveillance. But,  due to some security issues, there are some 
highways that have to be patrolled.  

<P>
Now, given the cost of patrolling highways, and that of installing video surveillance, 
find the  minimum cost of monitoring the whole city. Please keep in mind that, video 
surveillance can not  substitute the highway patrol completely. So, there has to be 
at least one highway that will be  patrolled.

In ``The Lord of the Rings II," when Prodo and the rest of the Fellowship 
of the Ring defeated the wizard of darkness, Saruman, he barely escaped 
death. Saruman gathered soldiers to attack the human countries again. 
Middle Earth was divided into two camps, a Saruman camp and a human camp. 
All the countries in the human camp made an alliance to protect their 
countries from Saruman. They agreed to help each other as follows:

Saruman was pleased to hear the news from a spy crow. He thought that he 
could ruin the human camp, because he needed not to fight with all the 
human countries simultaneously.

The lands of the human countries form a rectangle, and the rectangle is 
partitioned into several grids. The following figure shows an example 
for the human land. The land consists of <!-- MATH

<SPAN CLASS="MATH">4 <TT>x</TT> 5</SPAN> grids, and there 
are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I> <IMG

are adjacent each other as they share one or more grid boundaries, but 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> aren't adjacent each other. Note that, Saruman can attack

Saruman attacks only one country at once and uses all of his soldiers. 
In a war, the country that has more soldiers wins. If numbers of their 
soldiers are the same, the human country wins. All soldiers of a defeated 
country (including support forces) die, and any of a winner doesn't.

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I></SPAN> are 160, 300, 60 and 80 respectively, Saruman can't win if he has 
200 soldiers. However, if he has 210 soldiers, he can win by ruining the 
human countries <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> in turn.

Given the lands of the human countries and the numbers of soldiers of 
each human country and Saruman, determine which camp wins and dominates 
Middle Earth.

A DNA sequence consists of four letters, A, C, G, and T. The GC-ratio of a 
DNA sequence is the number of Cs and Gs of the sequence divided by the 
length of the sequence. GC-ratio is important in gene finding because DNA 
sequences with relatively high GC-ratios might be good candidates for the 
starting parts of genes. Given a very long DNA sequence, researchers are 
usually interested in locating a subsequence whose GC-ratio is maximum 
over all subsequences of the sequence. Since short subsequences with high 
GC-ratios are sometimes meaningless in gene finding, a length lower bound 
is given to ensure that a long subsequence with high GC-ratio could be 
found. If, in a DNA sequence, a 0 is assigned to every A and T and a 1 
to every C and G, the DNA sequence is transformed into a binary sequence 
of the same length. GC-ratios in the DNA sequence are now equivalent to 
averages in the binary sequence.

For the binary sequence above, if the length lower bound is 7, the maximum 
average is 6/8 which happens in the subsequence [7,14]. Its length is 8, 
which is greater than the length lower bound 7. If the length lower bound 
is 5, then the subsequence [7,11] gives the maximum average 4/5. The 
length is 5 which is equal to the length lower bound. For the subsequence 
[7,11], 7 is its starting index and 11 is its ending index. 

<P>
Given a binary sequence and a length lower bound <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN>, write a program to 
find a subsequence of the binary sequence whose length is at least <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> and 
whose average is maximum over all subsequences of the binary sequence. If 
two or more subsequences have the maximum average, then find the shortest 
one; and if two or more shortest subsequences with the maximum average 
exist, then find the one with the smallest starting index.

<P>Most high-level languages support structured data types. For example, Pascal has <TT>record</TT> types, C has <TT>struct</TT> types, and C++ and Java have <TT>class</TT> types. Structured types can have component types and a structured data should contain its component data.<P>We should consider the <SPAN CLASS="textit">memory alignment</SPAN> when storing the structured data. In a traditional computer of Von Neumann architecture, the computer memory is referenced in the unit of words. Therefore, for the fast data access, all the data stored in the computer memory should be aligned in the unit of words. Generally, the size of a word is a multiple of bytes and the word size is fixed for a computer. Sometimes we call a computer by the word size, namely, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I></SPAN>-byte computer, which means the size of words is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I></SPAN> bytes.<P>Due to the memory alignment, memory fragmentation occurs. For instance, a data of 1-byte size consumes 4 bytes in a 4-byte computer. Generally, a data type <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> causes memory fragmentation unless the size of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> is not a multiple of the word size. Let's take a closer look using an example of a C structure.<P><P><BR><TABLE><TR><TD><PRE>

    char a; 
    struct { 
        int x; 
        char c;

};

Ideally, the number of bytes to store the field a is just 1 but, practically, two bytes are required due to the memory alignment. The field <TT>b.x</TT> fits in two words and the number of bytes to store it is four. But, to store the field <TT>b.c</TT>, one word is required though the <TT>sizeof(b.c)</TT> is 1. Therefore, to store a structure of type <TT>A</TT>, 8 bytes are needed. In a 4-byte computer, a structure of type <TT>A</TT> requires 12 bytes. But, in an 1-byte computer, it requires only 6 bytes.<P>The program you should write is to read the size of words <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I></SPAN> of a computer and a structured type declaration <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> and compute the number of bytes required to store a structure of type <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I></SPAN>-byte computer. Your program should calculate the size considering the memory alignment.<P>For simplicity, assume that there only exist structure types and primitive types in our programming language. No pointers, no references, and no arrays are allowed in the type declaration. The keyword for declaring structures is <TT>struct</TT> and the structure identifier is followed just after the keyword struct. The keywords for primitive types are in a form of <TT>T</TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> is a positive decimal number (less than 10) denoting the number of bytes to store a datum of type <TT>T</TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>. Because of the restriction on <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> of <TT>T</TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> form, the names such as <TT>T0</TT> or <TT>T101T</TT> do not denote primitive types but identifiers. The struct name is used as a type name but it can be omitted if the structured type is not used elsewhere. But for these differences, all the other rules and the meaning of type declarations follow C rules. For instance, an empty structure (such as <code>struct Empty {};</code>) can be declared and the size of it is zero according to C rules. Rewriting the above declaration using these rules, the following declaration can be obtained:<P><PRE>
struct A { 
    T1 a; 
    struct { 
        T4 x; 
        T1 c; 
    } b; 
};
</PRE><P><P><BR>Note that an illegal type can be declared even though all the above syntactic rules are observed. For instance, we can think of two kinds of semantic errors: (1) declaring duplicated types (or fields) in the same scope and (2) declaring recursive structures. Your program should detect these two types of semantic errors.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your program is to read the input from standard input.

The end of each test case is marked by a single line containing the dollar sign `<TT>$</TT>' at the beginning of the line. The length of each input line is less than 1,000 characters.

<P>There were <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> cities in an ancient kingdom. In the beginning of the kingdom, all cities were isolated. Kings ordered their subjects to construct roads connecting cities. A lot of roads were built with time. Every road was always constructed along the line segment between two cities. All cities are partitioned into disjoint components of cities by road-connectivity. A connected component of cities was called a state. A state consists of cities and roads connecting them.<P>A historical record tells a time sequence of road constructions in order. A road connecting two cities <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> doesn't intersect with other roads at a point except for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>.

The figure below shows an example of a configuration of roads at some moment. A circle represents a city and a line segment represents a road between two cities. There are 3 states.

<P>A cellular network is a radio network made up of a number of cells each served by a base station located in the cell. The base station receives call signals from mobile users (<SPAN CLASS="textit">mobiles</SPAN>) in the cell it serves, which then connects the calls to the wired land-line telephone network. When a call is requested to connect to a mobile, the cellular network must know in which cell the mobile is located so that the call is routed to the base station of the cell appropriately.<P>Mobiles move from once cell to another in a cellular network. Whenever a mobile reports its new cell as it crosses boundaries of cells, the cellular network would know its exact cell at any time and finding (<SPAN CLASS="textit">paging</SPAN>) the mobile becomes a trivial task. But it is usually infeasible for a mobile to report its new location each time it enters a new cell because of the insufficiencies of resources such as the radio bandwidth. But normally at the time of a call arrival, the cellular network knows a limited number of cells where the mobile is located. In this situation, a lot of paging strategies are developed to locate a mobile efficiently. The ultimate goal of paging strategies is to minimize both the time delay and cost of paging until the mobile is found.<P>Now we define our problem formally. The <SPAN CLASS="textit">location area</SPAN> is the set of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> cells <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I> = {<I>c</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>c</I><SUB>2</SUB>,..., <I>c</I><SUB>n</SUB>}</SPAN> such that the mobile is guaranteed to be in one of these cells at the time of a call arrival. Suppose that it is possible to page any subset of these <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> cells in a unit of time (<SPAN CLASS="textit">paging rounds</SPAN>) and find out if the mobile is located in one of the cells paged. The fastest strategy to find the cell where the mobile is located is to page all the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> cells in the first and only round. However this strategy uses a lot of wireless bandwidth.<P>In many cases, the cellular network knows about the whereabouts of the mobile. This knowledge can be modeled with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> probability values, where the probability of the mobile being present in a cell can be estimated for each of these <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> cells at the time of a call arrival. Let <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> be the probability that the mobile is located at the cell <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> and all the probabilities are independent. A sequential paging strategy is to page the cells sequentially in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> paging rounds terminating once the mobile is found. Then the average cost of paging (number of cells paged), <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4731img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{C}}$"></SPAN> , and the average paging delay (number of paging rounds) in locating the mobile, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4731img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{D}}$"></SPAN>, can be expressed as follows:<P><P></P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay"><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4731img1.png ALT="$\displaystyle \overline{{C}}$"><IMG WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="63" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4731img1.png ALT="$\displaystyle \sum^{{n}}_{{i=1}}$">(<I>i</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>p</I><SUB>i</SUB>),<IMG WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4731img1.png ALT="$\displaystyle \overline{{D}}$"><IMG WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="63" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4731img1.png ALT="$\displaystyle \sum^{{n}}_{{i=1}}$">(<I>i</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>p</I><SUB>i</SUB>). </DIV><P></P><P>The <SPAN CLASS="textit">parallel paging strategy</SPAN> is to page the cells in a collection of cells simultaneously. Sequential paging strategy has lower paging cost than parallel paging strategy, but at the expense of larger paging delay. The method of parallel paging is to partition the cells in a location area into a series of indexed groups referred to as <SPAN CLASS="textit">paging zones</SPAN>. Let <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>Z</I><SUB>2</SUB>,..., <I>Z</I><SUB>w</SUB></SPAN> be the partition of the location area <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> (i.e., a partition of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> into <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I></SPAN> groups), where each <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> is non-empty and corresponds to a distinct paging zone. When a call arrives for a mobile, the cells in the first paging zone <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> are paged simultaneously in the first round and then if the mobile is not found in the first round of paging, all the cells in the second paging zone <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> are paged, and so on. Let the number of cells in the paging zone <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> be denoted by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><SUB>i</SUB> = | <I>Z</I><SUB>i</SUB>|</SPAN>, and let <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4731img1.png ALT="$ \pi_{{i}}^{}$"></SPAN> be the corresponding zone probabilities of the users in the paging zone <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4731img1.png ALT="$ \pi_{{i}}^{}$"> = <IMG WIDTH="57" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4731img1.png ALT="$ \sum_{{c_{j} \in Z_{i}}}^{}$"><I>p</I><SUB>j</SUB></SPAN>.

<P>During the Samhan Period or the Proto-Three Kingdoms Period, which refers to the period after the fall of Gojoseon and before the maturation of Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla into full-fledged kingdoms, the city-states of central and southern Korean Peninsula were grouped into three confederacies called Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan. Sam means <SPAN CLASS="textit">three</SPAN>, and Han is a Korean word meaning <SPAN CLASS="textit">great</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="textit">leader</SPAN>. The names of these confederacies are reflected in the current name of Korea, Daehan Minguk (literally, ``Great Han People's Nation").<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="645" HEIGHT="503" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4732.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4732.eps}"></DIV><P>One of the city-states called Saro-guk, which was established by King Park Hyeokgeose in 57 BCE, around present-day Gyeongju, was the leader of Jinhan confederacy. As the city-state expanded, it changed its name to Silla, which was the longest sustained dynasty in Asian history. We knew little about other city-states of Jinhan confederacy, with the exception of their names.<P>Recently, Prof. Choi, who is a highly considered archaeologist, announced that he had found the tomb of King Park Hyeokgeose. By virtue of his major archaeological discovery, we get to know a little of the daily life of Jinhan people. However, even the locations of city-states of Jinhan confederacy except for Saro-guk have been not known as yet. Thanks to his success of deciphering the inscription engraved on the stone wall of the tomb, the distances between some pairs of city-states of Jinhan confederacy including pairs between Saro-guk and every other city-state have been known.<P>An ambitious research for estimating the locations of all city-states of Jinhan confederacy is initiated by Prof. Choi and his research group. He conjectures that the city-states of Jinhan confederacy were located in a row. His conjecture is based on the knowledge that Jinhan confederacy was located at between the Taebaek Mountains and East Sea. To verify his conjecture, he develops a mathematical model, where the area occupied by Jinhan confederacy is simplified into a straight line, say the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>-axis, and the distance between two citystates is represented by a positive integer. The location of a city-state can be described by a point on the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>-axis. It is assumed that Saro-guk is located at the origin of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>-axis.<P>Prof. Choi wants to determine whether or not it is possible to locate all the city-states of Jinhan confederacy on the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>-axis subject to the distance constraints between the city-states. Of course, no two city-states should occupy the same location. Write a program that can help him. We denote by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> the number of city-states of Jinhan confederacy, and assume that the city-states are numbered from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> inclusive and thus no two citystates have the same number. Saro-guk has a number of 1. The distances between some pairs of city-states including pairs of Saro-guk and every other city-state are given as input.<P>For example, if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> is equal to three, the distance between city-states numbered 1 and 2 is four, and the distance between city-states 1 and 3 is also four, then it is possible to locate the city-states 1, 2, and 3 at positions 0, 4, and -4 on the x-axis, respectively. They can be located at positions 0, -4, and 4, too. However, they cannot be located neither at positions 0, 4, and 4 nor at positions 0, -4, and -4.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your program is to read from standard input.

<P>Number guessing is a popular game between elementary-school kids. Teachers encourage pupils to play the game as it enhances their arithmetic skills, logical thinking, and following-up simple procedures. We think that, most probably, you too will master in few minutes. Here's one example of how you too can play this game: Ask a friend to think of a number, let's call it <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><SUB>0</SUB></SPAN>.<P>Then:<P><OL><LI>Ask your friend to compute <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><SUB>1</SUB> = 3*<I>n</I><SUB>0</SUB></SPAN> and to tell you if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> is even or odd. </LI><LI>If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> is even, ask your friend to compute <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><SUB>2</SUB> = <I>n</I><SUB>1</SUB>/2</SPAN>. If, otherwise, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> was odd then let your friend compute <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><SUB>2</SUB> = (<I>n</I><SUB>1</SUB> + 1)/2</SPAN>. </LI><LI>Now ask your friend to calculate <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><SUB>3</SUB> = 3*<I>n</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>. </LI><LI>Ask your friend to tell you the result of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><SUB>4</SUB> = <I>n</I><SUB>3</SUB>/9</SPAN>.

<P>K<SMALL>ERMIT </SMALL>T<SMALL>HE </SMALL>F<SMALL>ROG</SMALL> is a classic video game with a simple control and objective but requires a good deal of thinking. You control an animated frog that can walk and hop, in both forward and backward directions. The frog stands in a <SPAN CLASS="textit">space</SPAN> between an otherwise a contiguous line of <SPAN CLASS="textit">tiles</SPAN>. Each tile is painted black on one side, and white on the other. The frog can <SPAN ID="txt51">walk</SPAN> (<SPAN ID="txt52">forward</SPAN>, or <SPAN ID="txt53">backward</SPAN>) over an adjacent tile (<SPAN CLASS="textit">in front</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="textit">behind</SPAN> him.) When the frog walks over a tile, the tile <SPAN CLASS="textit">slides</SPAN> to the space where the frog was standing.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="403" HEIGHT="447" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4737.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4737.eps}"></DIV><P>For example, in the adjacent figure, the frog has two tiles behind him, and three in front. We'll use the notation <TT>BWFBBW</TT> to refer to this situation where <TT>F</TT> refers to the space (where the frog is standing,) <TT>B</TT> is a tile with its black face showing, while <TT>W</TT> is a tile with its white face showing. The forward direction is from left to right. If the frog were to walk forward, the resulting situation is <TT>BWBFBW</TT>. Similar behavior when the frog walks backward, the tile behind the frog slides to where the frog was standing. The frog can also <SPAN ID="txt66">hop</SPAN> over the tiles. The frog can <SPAN ID="txt67">hop</SPAN> over an adjacent tile landing on the tile next to it. For example, if the frog was to <SPAN ID="txt68">hop backward</SPAN>, it would land on the first (left-most) tile, and the tile would jump to the space where the frog was standing. In addition, <SPAN CLASS="textit">the tile would flip sides</SPAN>. For example, hopping backward in the figure would result in the situation: <TT>FWWBBW</TT>.

General Gee is the commander of a military base. He has just received alarming news from one 
of his spies: the enemy's preparing an air missile strike. The base contains two magnetic 
towers. When activated and given sufficient power, each of the magnetic towers creates a 
powerful horizontal magnetic disk. If any missile passes through this disk it deflects away 
from the base. Although those towers seem to be an excellent air defense method, there is 
a problem: The area of the disk generated by a tower is proportional to the amount of 
energy it receives. The base has enough power plants to generate a certain amount of 
energy, which has to be divided among those two towers. That means that the total area 
of the two disks generated from the towers should not exceed the total energy generated 
by the power plants. Fortunately, the spy was able to know the exact target co-ordinates 
of the incoming missiles and he reported them to General Gee. The General needs your help 
in distributing the energy on the two magnetic towers to minimize the number of missiles 
that will not get deflected by the magnetic towers and therefore will hit the base. 
You may assume the following: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>The towers have different heights and therefore there are no problems associated with 
the magnetic disks interfering with each other. 
</LI>
<LI>A missile will deflect if it passes through the magnetic disk of a tower or even if it 
just touches its boundary. 
</LI>
<LI>A missile hitting a tower (landing exactly on its location) will deflect, even if the 
tower is not given any energy. 
</LI>
<LI>All incoming missiles will go down simultaneously at the exact instant; therefore, 
there will not be any time available to redistribute the energy amongst the two towers 
during the strike. 
</LI>

<P>I have to admit, the solution I proposed last year for solving the bank cash crisis didn't solve the whole economic crisis. As it turns out, companies don't have that much cash in the first place. They have assets which are primarily shares in other companies. It is common, and acceptable, for one company to own shares in another. What complicates the issue is for two companies to own shares <SPAN CLASS="textit">in each other at the same time</SPAN>. If you think of it for a moment, this means that each company now (indirectly) controls its own shares.<P>New market regulation is being implemented: No company can control shares in itself, whether directly or indirectly. The Stock Market Authority is looking for a computerized solution that will help it detect any buying activity that will result in a company controlling its own shares. It is obvious why they need a program to do so, just imagine the situation where company <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> buying shares in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> buying in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>, and then <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> buying in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>. While the first two purchases are acceptable. The third purchase should be rejected since it will lead to the three companies controlling shares in themselves. The program will be given all purchasing transactions in chronological order. The program should reject any transaction that could lead to one company controlling its own shares.

Image blurring occurs when the object being captured is out of the camera's focus. The top 
two figures on the right are an example of an image and its blurred version. Restoring the 
original image given only the blurred version is one of the most interesting topics in 
image processing. This process is called deblurring, which will be your task for this 
problem.

In this problem, all images are in grey-scale (no colours). Images are represented as a 2 
dimensional matrix of real numbers, where each cell corresponds to the brightness of the 
corresponding pixel. Although not mathematically accurate, one way to describe a blurred 
image is through averaging <SPAN  CLASS="textit">all the pixels that are within (less than or equal to) a 
certain Manhattan distance from each pixel (including the pixel itself)</SPAN>. The <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Manhattan Distance</SPAN> 
(sometimes called the Taxicab distance) 
between two points is the sum of the (absolute) difference of their coordinates. The 
grid on the lower right illustrates the Manhattan distances from the grayed cell.

<P>The great hall of the national museum has been robbed few times recently. Everyone is now worried about the security of the treasures on display. To help secure the hall, the museum contracted with a private security company to provide additional guards to stay in the great hall and keep an eye on the ancient artifacts. The museum would like to hire the minimum number of additional guards so that the great hall is secured.<P>The great hall is represented as a two dimensional grid of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>C</I></SPAN> cells. Some cells are already occupied with the museum's guards. All remaining cells are occupied by artifacts of different types (statues, sculptures, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN> etc.) which can be replaced by new hired guards. For each artifact, few other cells in the hall are identified as critical points of the artifact depending on the artifact value, type of vault it is kept inside, and few other factors. In other words, if this artifact is going to stay in the hall then all of its critical points must have guards standing on them. A guard standing in a critical position of multiple artifacts can keep an eye on them all. A guard, however, can not stand in a cell which contains an artifact (instead, you may remove the artifact to allow the guard to stay there). Also you can not remove an artifact and leave the space free (you can only replace an artifact with a new hired guard).<P>Surveying all the artifacts in the great hall you figured out that the critical points of any artifact (marked by a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4742img1.png ALT="$ \bigotimes$"></SPAN>) are always a subset of the 12 neighboring cells as shown in the grid below.<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=5 BORDER FRAME=BOX RULES=GROUPS><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><TBODY><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>2</TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>3</TD><TD></TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>1</TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>9</TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>4</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>12</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4742img1.png ALT="$ \bigotimes$"></SPAN></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>10</TD><TD></TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>8</TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>11</TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>5</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>7</TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>6</TD><TD></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P><P><BR>Accordingly, the type of an artifact can be specified as a non-negative integer where the i-th bit is 1 only if critical point number i from the picture above is a critical point of that artifact.

When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above that line will fall down respectively.

<P>Bytetown has a long tradition in organizing an international flower exhibition. Professor Feuerbach, a true flower lover, visited the exhibition this year. He was pleased by the most beautiful flowers and other plants around the world roses, orchids, magnolias, cactuses. All flowers were nicely placed.<P>The flower placement that was the most appealing to him was composed of many kinds of flowers placed in a rectangular grid, such that each row of the grid contained each kind of flowers exactly once and each column of the grid contained each kind of flowers at most once.<P>Professor Feuerbach is a good mathematician and soon he realized that the number of columns of the grid has to be the same as the number of different kinds of flowers in the placement. The different kinds of flowers are represented by numbers <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1, 2..., <I>N</I></SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> is the number of different kinds of flowers. Soon he encountered a new problem. He would like to add one row of flowers to the placement without violating the rules stated above.

<P>``Tractor" is a very popular poker game in China. There are four players in the game. Suppose their names are Alice, Bob, Charles and David, in clockwise order. A judge is needed for this game. The players are divided into two teams, Alice and Charles are in team 1, and the other two are in team 2. The prop they use to play the game are two decks of pokers, including 108 cards in total. A simplified rule of the game is described below.<P><P><BR>The whole game contains a number of rounds. In each round, one team is called <SPAN CLASS="textbf">``Declarers" (CT)</SPAN>; the other team is called <SPAN CLASS="textbf">``Defenders" (FT)</SPAN>. Each team has a <SPAN CLASS="textbf">current rank (CR)</SPAN>. The goal of the player is to increase his own team's CR as much as possible.<P><P><BR>A certain round has a <SPAN CLASS="textbf">Main Suit</SPAN> (Heart - H, Spade - S, Club - C, Diamond D, or <SPAN CLASS="textbf">None - no main suit</SPAN> in this round) and its CR. The CR in this round is the CR of the CT, and Main Suit will be given. The Main Suit and CR will be used to determine the order of the cards.<P><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Cards ranked 5, 10, King value 5, 10, 10 pts (points) respectively, all other cards value 0 pts</SPAN>. In one round, we only consider the FT's pts. The rules of getting pts for FT will be discussed later.<P><P><BR>If the FT gets less than 80 pts in one round, they will hold be FT in the next round. This situation is called <SPAN CLASS="textbf">``make"</SPAN>. Otherwise, they become CT in the next round and the original CT become FT instead. This situation is called <SPAN CLASS="textbf">``down"</SPAN>.<P>If the FT gets 0 pts, the CR of the current CT will be increased by 3, for example, if the CR of the CT is 9, it will become Queen (12). Otherwise, if the FT gets less than 40 pts, the CR of the CT will be increased by 2. Otherwise, if the FT gets less than 80 pts, the CR of the CT will be increased by 1. Otherwise, if the FT gets not less than <SPAN CLASS="MATH">80 + <I>k</I> <TT>*</TT> 40</SPAN> pts and less than <SPAN CLASS="MATH">120 + <I>k</I> <TT>*</TT> 40</SPAN> pts, the CR of the current FT will be increased by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>. For example, if the FT gets 255 pts in a round, the CR of the current FT will be increased by 4; and if the FT gets 80 pts, both teams' CR remain unchanged. If a team's CR becomes <SPAN CLASS="textbf">beyond Ace</SPAN>, this team is considered the WINNER of the whole game.<P><P><BR>During a round, one of the players in CT is called the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">dealer</SPAN>. If ``make", the pard (teammate) of the dealer becomes the next round's dealer. Otherwise (``down"), the player on dealer's right-hand side becomes the dealer of the next round. For example, if the dealer of the current round is Alice and her team (CT) is ``down", the dealer of the next round should be Bob (on Alice's right-hand side).<P><P><BR>At the start of a round, each of the players except the dealer gets exactly 25 cards; the dealer gets all the remaining 33 cards. After that, the dealer chooses 8 of his cards and gives them to the judge, and these cards are called `<SPAN CLASS="textbf">`hidden cards"</SPAN>.<P>Now each player has exactly 25 cards. A round consists of several <SPAN CLASS="textbf">tricks</SPAN>. In the first trick, the dealer plays one or more cards (called <SPAN CLASS="textbf">``lead"</SPAN>), then, in clockwise order, players play the same number of cards as the first player one by one (called <SPAN CLASS="textbf">``follow"</SPAN>). The winner of the current trick leads cards during the next trick, and so on. <SPAN CLASS="textbf">If the winner of the current trick is a member of FT, then the FT gets the sum of the cards' pts played in this trick.</SPAN><P><P><P><BR>Now we start to describe how to determine the winner of a trick. After the main suit and the CR of the current round are fixed, we can determine the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">``trumps"</SPAN> which are cards with main suit or CR (Current Rank), and the Jokers. All other cards are <SPAN CLASS="textbf">``not-trumps"</SPAN>.<P>We can have an order among all the cards according the following rules:<DL COMPACT><DT>(1)</DT><DD>``Trumps" are ordered higher than ``not-trumps".</DD><DT>(2)</DT><DD>For the trumps, the order are listed below:<P>Red Joker<P>Black Joker<P>card with main suit and CR (if exists)<P>other card with CR<P>other trumps ordered by their ranks(i.e., A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN>, 3, 2)</DD><DT>(3)</DT><DD>For the ``not-trumps", they are ordered by their ranks.</DD></DL><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="442" HEIGHT="645" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4749.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4749.eps}"></DIV><P><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Assume in all the description below, in the current round, the CR of the CT is 7.</SPAN><P>Suppose the main suit is H, the cards can be arranged in this order (as an example):<P><P><BR><B>S2 , C2 , D2</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> S3 , C3 , D3</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> S4 , C4 , D4</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> S5 , C5 , D5</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> S6 , C6 , D6</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> S8 , C8 , D8</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> S9 , C9 , D9</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> ST , FT , CT (T - 10)</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> SJ , CJ , DJ (J - Jack)</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> SQ , CQ , DQ (Q - Queen)</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> SK , CK , DK (K - King)</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> SA , CA , DA (A - Ace)</B><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> H2</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> H3</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> H4</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> H5</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> H6</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> H8</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> H9</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> HT</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> HJ</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> HQ</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> HK</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> HA</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> S7 = C7 = D7</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> H7</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> BJ (the Black Joker)</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> RJ (the Red Joker)</SPAN><BR><P><P><BR>If ``None" during this round, then the pokers can be arranged in this order:<P><P><BR><B>H2 , S2 , C2 , D2</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> H3 , S3 , C3 , D3</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> H4 , S4 , C4 , D4</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> H5 , S5 , C5 , D5</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> H6 , S6 , C6 , D6</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> H8 , S8 , C8 , D8</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> H9 , S9 , C9 , D9</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> HT , ST , FT , CT</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> HJ , SJ , CJ , DJ</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> HQ , SQ , CQ , DQ</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> HK , SK , CK , DK</B><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> HA , SA , CA , DA</B><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> H7 = S7 = C7 = D7</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> BJ</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;</SPAN> RJ</SPAN><BR><P><P><BR>In these two tables, <SPAN CLASS="textbf">cards written in italic</SPAN> are ``trumps", and <SPAN CLASS="textbf">cards written in boldface</SPAN> are ``not-trumps".<P>In each trick, the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">lead cards</SPAN> (played by the player leading this trick) must be either all ``trumps", or all ``not-trumps" with same suit.<P><P><BR>The possible <SPAN CLASS="textbf">structures</SPAN> of the cards are listed below <SPAN CLASS="textbf">(assume the main suit is H and main rank is 7 for the example)</SPAN>:<P><DL><DT><STRONG><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Single.</SPAN></STRONG></DT><DD>A single card, such as <TT>D9</TT>.<P></DD><DT><STRONG><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Pair.</SPAN></STRONG></DT><DD>Two same cards, such as <TT>D9D9</TT>.

Each of the Single, Pair or Tractor in a Throw is one of the Throw's component. In the original tractor game, in some situation, the throw will be rejected. But, to keep the rule simple, we assume in this problem all the throws are accepted. For example, <TT>RJRJBJBJH7H7HQHQHJHJH9H9H6H6HAH2</TT> contains six components: two tractors, two pairs and two single cards (<TT>RJRJBJBJH7H7-HQHQHJHJ-H9H9-H6H6-HA-H2</TT>); <TT>CACAC8C8CK</TT> contains three components: two pairs and one single card (<TT>CACA-C8C8-CK</TT>).</DD></DL><P>A throw can be treated as different list of components, for example, <TT>H2H2H3H3H4H4H5H5H6H6</TT> can also be treated as <TT>H2H2H3H3-H4H4H5H5H6H6</TT>, or <TT>H2H2-H3H3H4H4H4H5H5-H6H6</TT>, and so on. For the lead cards, each time we choose the longest component (choose the one with the highest order to break the tie) to construct a list of components, this list is the structure of the lead cards, also <SPAN CLASS="textbf">the structure of the trick</SPAN>. <SPAN CLASS="textbf">So that the structure of the trick is unique.</SPAN><P>After the first player lead his or her cards, other players follow cards one by one in clockwise order, as mentioned above.<P>An important part of the game is to determine the winner of a trick:<P>If one's follow cards contain both ``trumps" and ``not-trumps", or all ``not-trumps" but with different suits, this player can't be winner of this trick.<P>Otherwise, if the lead cards are all ``not-trumps" and one's follow cards contain ``not-trumps" with different suit from the lead cards, this follow player can't be the winner of this trick.<P>Else, if one's follow cards can't be constructed as the same structure of lead cards, this player can't be the winner of this trick either.<P>Otherwise, if the structure of this trick is not ``throw", the one who played the highest-ordered card wins this trick. If more than one player played the same highest-ordered card, <SPAN CLASS="textbf">the winner of this trick will be the one who plays the highest-ordered card first.</SPAN><P>Now let's consider the ``throw" situation. We construct the follow cards into the structure of the lead cards, so that the order of the highest-ordered card in all the longest components of the ``throw" is as high as possible (this card is called <SPAN CLASS="textbf">``honor card"</SPAN>). <SPAN CLASS="textbf">Note that tractor can be treated as several pairs or shorter tractors, and pair can be treated as two single cards.</SPAN> The winner of this trick is the one who plays the highest-ordered ``honor card". Similarly, if more than one player played the same highest-ordered ``honor card" the winner of this trick will be the one who plays the highest-ordered ``honor card" first.<P>There are many hair-raising rules about lead and follow cards; fortunately, they're not related to this problem, the only thing we care about is: when someone leads a ``not-trump" ``throw" the only possible way to beat it is to ``throw" the same structure of ``trumps". And it's impossible to beat a leading ``trump" ``throw".<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Special attention on the examples below.</SPAN> In these examples, Alice always leads cards.

During the game, a series of notes may fall in each sound track irregularly. When notes fall down in one sound track, player should press the assigned key at once. If so, then got a ``Cool", or get ``Miss" otherwise.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="346" HEIGHT="823" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4752.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4752.eps}"></DIV><P>There are two types of ``Note": ``single note" and ``strip note". Just as the name implies, ``single note" means a single note, press right key at the right time once, then you can get a ``Cool", otherwise ``Miss"; ``strip note" needs you keeping press the corresponding key from the start time to the end time of the note. Press key at the begin time you may get a ``Cool", and release at the end time to get another ``Cool", you will ``Miss" either early or late. <SPAN CLASS="textbf">If ``Miss" at the begin time, then ``Miss" the other (the end time) immediately.

For example, when Track 1,4,5,6 fall a note at the same time respectively, we should press the four keys at the same time, but now, keys confliction may happen, and cause this to fail, then you will ``Miss" all these four notes. Keys confliction meets the relation of inclusion, in other words, if keys set S would cause the confliction, so would keys set T when S is included in T.

<P>
Facer is addicted to a game called ``Tidy is learning to swim". But he finds it too easy. 
So he develops a new game called ``Facer is learning to swim" which is more difficult and 
more interesting. 

<P>
In the new game, a robot named ``Facer" is swimming in a pool. The pool 
can be considered as a  vertical  <!-- MATH
 $N \times M$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>M</I></SPAN> grid.  The  coordinates  of  the  top-left  cell  
is  (1,1),  and  the  coordinates  of  the  bottom-right cell is <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>N</I>, <I>M</I>)</SPAN>. Cells in the top 
rows are called ``surface cells", and all other cells are  called ``under water cells".

Shadowed cells are poisonous.

</DIV>

<P>
Facer starts swimming from the top-left cell (1,1) and must arrive at the top-right cell 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(1, <I>M</I>)</SPAN>. He  has a constant horizontal speed of 1 per second, and a vertical speed of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> 
per second. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> is always  integer and can be changed. If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> is positive, it means Facer 
is moving down; and if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> is negative, it  means Facer is moving up. So if Facer is at 
cell <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>)</SPAN> now, he will arrive at cell <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I> + <I>v</I>, <I>y</I> + 1)</SPAN> after a second. Be careful  that 
if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I> + <I>v</I> &gt; <I>N</I></SPAN>, Facer will get to cell <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>N</I>, <I>y</I> + 1)</SPAN> because he cannot move down anymore 
and of course if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I> + <I>v</I> &lt; 1</SPAN>, Facer will get to cell <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(1, <I>y</I> + 1)</SPAN> because he cannot  
fly. Please remember that all the ``under water cells" in the right-most column are 
poisonous. If Facer goes into those cells, he will die.  

<P>
The capacity of Facer's oxygen bottle is limited, and when Facer gets into  
a surface cell, the oxygen bottle is refilled automatically. Facer has to refill his 
oxygen bottle every <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> seconds, which means that during the time between two refillings, 
Facer can only pass at most <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I> - 1</SPAN> under water cells in the horizontal direction.    

<P>
In every cell, there is either a ``speed changing machine" or a ``money box" (can't be 
both). Every  speed changing machine has a value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> and every money box has a value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>. 

<P>
You have got enough number of devices called ``speedo". Every speedo has a value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN> which 
is 1 or -1. You can put your speedos in any cells, but you can put at most one speedo in 
a cell. 

<P>
When Facer reaches a cell, the speed changing machine of value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> in that cell 
(if there is one) will  change his vertical speed by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>, and the speedo of value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN> in that 
cell (if there is one) will change  his vertical speed by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN>. For example, if Facer's 
vertical speed is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> when he arrives at a cell with a speed changing machine of value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> and 
a speedo of value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN>, his vertical speed will be changed to  <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I> + <I>T</I> + <I>Q</I></SPAN> immediately. There 
are three more things you need to know about speed changing:  

<P>

<OL>
<LI>All speed changing machines in the surface cells can't work.  
</LI>
<LI>When reaching a surface cell without a speedo, Facer's vertical speed becomes zero  
immediately; and when reaching a surface cell with a speedo of value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN>, Facer's vertical  
speed becomes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN> immediately.  
</LI>
<LI>When reaching a bottom cell, though Facer can't go down any more, his vertical speed will  
NOT be changed unless there is a speedo or a speed changing machine in that cell. It's maybe  
sound a little bit weird but Facer really is such a weird guy.    
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
When arriving at a cell with a money box of value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>, Facer gets <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> dollars (In fact, if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> 
is negative,  Facer loses <SPAN CLASS="MATH">| <I>P</I>|</SPAN> dollars). Facer's total amount of money can be negative -- 
that means Facer owes  some money to the pool's owner.  

<P>
You task is deploying your speedos 
in a smart way before Facer starts swimming, so Facer can get  money as much as possible 
when he arrives at cell <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(1, <I>M</I>)</SPAN>. Facer's initial vertical speed is zero and if you put 
a speedo in the cell (1,1), it will change Facer's initial vertical speed.

Though the story of Shaolong Xiang, the great time-traveler, is not recorded in the 
history, some  recent discoveries show the possibility that the ancient mystery visitor 
might really exist. Several  months  ago,  a  strange  machine  was  found  together  
with  some  newly  unearthed  terra-cotta  warriors. That machine looks like a modern 
machine and even has some electronic parts - that's  why people take Mr. Xiang into 
consideration when guessing the origin of the strange machine.      

<P>
After  careful 
examinations,  scientists  finally  figured  out  what  the  machine  is  -  it  
actually  is  a  vending  machine  in  Qin  dynasty!  There  is  a  hole  on  a  
panel  of  the  machine,  and  scientists  are  pretty sure that Qin people put 
their coins into the machine through that hole to buy things. As  you  know,  
there  were  too  many  different  types  of  coins  before  Qin  dynasty  and  
Emperor  Qin  Shihuang didn't like that. But scientists found an announcement 
made by Qin Shihuang carved on  the machine, saying that any coins which can go 
through the hole is still legal to use. Now your  task is to determine whether a 
certain type of coin can be put into the hole-from these results  we might find 
some clues about the mystery time-traveler.    

<P>
The hole on the panel is a polygon 
and all coins also have a shape of polygon. THEY ALL MAYBE  CONCAVE. Scientist 
found out that ancient people use the vending machine this way: The panel  with 
the hole was positioned horizontally, and the customer chose a best position above 
the hole  to hold a coin. Then the customer dropped the coin. During the process of 
felling down, the coin  WOULD NOT ROTATE in any direction. If the coin could go 
through the hole, the coin is considered  ``legal".  Otherwise,  the  coin  is  
judged  ``illegal".  If  the  coin  just  merely  touched  the  edges  of  the  
hole but was not blocked, it was considered as legal. For example, as shown in 
the sample input,  a square coin with side length 5 can go through a triangle 
hole with sides of length 3, 4 and 5, so  it's legal.

The city of M is a famous shopping city and its open-air shopping malls are extremely 
attractive.  During the tourist seasons, thousands of people crowded into these shopping 
malls and enjoy the  vary-different shopping.    

<P>
Unfortunately, the climate has changed little by little and now rainy days seriously affected 
the operation of open-air shopping malls -- it's obvious that nobody will have a good mood  
when  shopping in the rain. In order to change this situation, the manager of these 
open-air shopping  malls would like to build a giant umbrella to solve this problem.  

<P>
These shopping malls can be considered as different circles. It is guaranteed that these 
circles will  not intersect with each other and no circles will be contained in another 
one. The giant umbrella  is also a circle. Due to some technical reasons, the center of 
the umbrella must coincide with the  center of a shopping mall. Furthermore, a fine 
survey shows that for any mall, covering half of its  area  is  enough  for  people  
to  seek  shelter  from  the  rain,  so  the  task  is  to  decide  the  minimum  
radius of the giant umbrella so that for every shopping mall, the umbrella can cover 
at least half  area of the mall.

Ted  has  a  new  house  with  a  huge  window.  In  this  big  summer,  Ted  
decides  to  decorate  the  window with some posters to prevent the glare outside. 
All things that Ted can find are rectangle  posters.      

<P>
However, Ted is such a 
picky guy that in every poster he finds something ugly. So before he pastes  a 
poster on the window, he cuts a rectangular hole on that poster to remove the 
ugly part. Ted is  also a careless guy so that some of the pasted posters may 
overlap when he pastes them on the  window.      

<P>
Ted wants to know the total 
area of the window covered by posters. Now it is your job to figure it  out.  

<P>
To  make  your  job  easier,  we  assume  that  the  window  is  a  rectangle 
located  in  a  rectangular  coordinate system. The window's bottom-left corner 
is at position (0, 0) and top-right corner is at  position (50000, 50000).

``<SPAN  CLASS="textit">There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's eyes.</SPAN>`` 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">--W.William Shakespeare</SPAN>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Lotus is a big fan of 
Shakespeare. Her favorite tragedy written by Shakespeare is Hamlet, one of  the most 
popular works in English language. However, since Lotus is really a merciful and  
kindhearted girl, she doesn't like the scene of the final match, in which Hamlet 
fenced against  Laertes. Once she had a dream of Hamlet. In that dream, Hamlet 
fought with Laertes in another  way: flipping coins.    

<P>
It sounds like gambling. 
In order to flip the coin in an absolutely fair way, Hamlet got a monkey to  do 
this job instead of people. Before the monkey started to flip, Hamlet and Laertes 
respectively  wrote down an arbitrary sequence of results (we call it a ``pattern").
For example, Hamlet wrote  down ``Head, Tail, Head" while Laertes wrote down ``Head, 
Head, Tail, Tail".It was guaranteed  that the pattern of Hamlet's did not occur within 
the pattern of Laertes', nor did the pattern of  Laertes' occur within the pattern of 
Hamlet's. Then the monkey began to flip the coin over and  over and generated a sequence 
of results, like ``Head, Head, Tail, Head, Tail ..." At any time, if the  monkey obtained 
Hamlet's pattern, it stopped flipping and Hamlet won. Otherwise, if the  monkey obtained 
Laertes's pattern, it also stopped flipping and Laertes won.      

<P>
One example of the 
gambling is like following: Hamlet's pattern was ``HHT" (H=Head, T=Tail) and  his 
rival's pattern was ``HTTT". The monkey flipped the coin and obtained ``H, T, H, T, T, 
H, T, T, T".  At that time, Laertes' pattern appeared at the end of the sequence, so the 
monkey stopped and  the judge declared that Laertes won the game.      

<P>
Now your task is 
to decide that in Lotus' gambling, who has the higher probability to win the  game. Pay 
attention that since the monkey has no bias, the probabilities to get head or tail in  
one flip are always equal.

`<TT>Equal</TT>'.     

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Hint:</SPAN> 

<P>
For the first sample case, to end the game, one flip is enough. If it is head, Hamlet wins.  
Otherwise Laertes wins. As a result, both of them has 1/2 probability to win.    

<P>
For the 
second sample case, if the first flip is tail, Hamlet wins. Otherwise if the second flip 
is tail,  also Hamlet wins. Otherwise Laertes wins. So the probability that Hamlet wins 
the game is 3/4,  while the probability that Laertes wins is 1/4. Hamlet has a better 
chance.

The two players alternately color an uncolored edge of G with their color until all edges are colored.

<P>On the evening of 3 August 1492, Christopher Columbus departed from Palos de la Frontera with a few ships, starting a serious of voyages of finding a new route to India. As you know, just in those voyages, Columbus discovered the America continent which he thought was India.<P>Because the ships are not large enough and there are seldom harbors in his route, Columbus had to buy food and other necessary things from savages. Gold coins were the most popular currency in the world at that time and savages also accept them. Columbus wanted to buy <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> kinds of goods from savages, and each kind of goods has a price in gold coins. Columbus brought enough glass beads with him, because he knew that for savages, a glass bead is as valuable as a gold coin. Columbus could buy an item he need only in four ways below:<P><P><BR><OL><LI>Pay the price all by gold coins. </LI><LI>Pay by ONE glass bead and some gold coins. In this way, if an item's price is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> gold coins, Columbus could just pay <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> - 1</SPAN> gold coins and one glass bead. </LI><LI>Pay by an item which has the same price. </LI><LI>Pay by a cheaper item and some gold coins. </LI></OL><P><P><BR>Columbus found out an interesting thing in the trade rule of savages: For some kinds of goods, when the buyer wanted to buy an item by paying a cheaper item and some gold coins, he didn't have to pay the price difference, he can pay less. If one could buy an item of kind A by paying a cheaper item of kind B plus some gold coins less than the price difference between B and A, Columbus called that there was a ``bargain" between kind B and kind A. To get an item, Columbus didn't have to spend gold coins as many as its price because he could use glass beads or took full advantages of ``bargains". So Columbus wanted to know, for any kind of goods, at least how many gold coins he had to spend in order to get one - Columbus called it ``actual price" of that kind of goods.<P>Just for curiosity, Columbus also wanted to know, how many kinds of goods are there whose ``actual price" was equal to the sum of ``actual price" of other two kinds.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>There are several test cases.<P>The first line in the input is an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> indicating the number of test cases <!-- MATH

<P>Peer-to-peer(P2P) computing technology has been widely used on the Internet to exchange data. A lot of P2P file sharing systems exist and gain much popularity in nowadays.<P>Let's consider a simplified model of P2P file sharing system: There are many computers in the system, and they can receive data from or send data to others. To simplify the problem, let's assume that there is just ONE large file which is of our concern in the system. Some computers already have the whole file (we call them ``servers") and some don't(we call them ``clients"). Every client needs to download the file from servers. When a client gets the WHOLE file, it becomes a server.<P>These computers are not always online. An online client will down load the file from all online servers. Different servers send data of different parts of the file to a client, so the client can download the file faster.<P>Now given the transfer speed between each pair of computers, what time is every computer online or offline, and which computers are servers at the beginning, please analyze the running of the system in a period of time.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The first line contains an integer indicating the number of test cases.<P><P><BR>For each test case:<P><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Line 1:</SPAN> It contains two positive integers: <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>n</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4762img1.png ALT="$ \le$">20, <I>T</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4762img1.png ALT="$ \le$">1000)</SPAN> meaning that there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> computers in the system numbered from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>, and you task is to figure out that how many percentage of the file does every computer gets after <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> seconds from the beginning.<P><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Line 2:</SPAN> It contains two positive integers: <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>k</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4762img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>n</I>, <I>S</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4762img1.png ALT="$ \le$">2<SUP>20</SUP>)</SPAN> meaning that at the beginning there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> servers, and the size of the file of our concern is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> (KB).<P><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Line 3:</SPAN> It contains <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> integers.

I guess most of you played cards on the trip to Harbin, but I'm sure you have never 
played the following card game. This card game has <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> rounds and 100000 types of cards 
numbered from 1 to 100000. A new card will be opened when each round begins. You can 
``bing" this new card. And if the card you last ``bing" is the same with this new one, you 
will get 1 point. You can "bing" only one card, but you can change it into a new one. For 
example, the order of the 4 cards is 1 3 4 3. You can ``bing" 1 in the first round and 
change it into 3 in the second round. You get no point in the third round, but get 1 point 
in the last round. Additionally, there is a special card 999. If you ``bing" it and it is 
opened again, you will get 3 point. 

<P>
Given the order of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> cards, tell me the maximum points you can get.

It is made of candy and haws and always appears as a string on a stick.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="856" HEIGHT="802" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4765a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4765a.eps}"></DIV><P>When making the string of candied haws, people always want to take as many haws as possible on a stick. Therefore, inspired by this will, let's think about an easier problem. First of all, haws are balls, but we only think about problems on a plane this time, so they can be just considered as circles. Then with different size of haws, we have different size of circles. The stick is modeled as a straight line. And at last we can be a little greedy that there are haws (circles) on the table (plane), and with a stick (line), we can place it at any position to pass as many haws as possible.<P>Generally speaking, your task is to find a line in the form of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Ax</I> + <I>By</I> + <I>C</I> = 0</SPAN> to pass as many circles on a plane as possible and tell this maximum number. It is regarded as ``pass" even if the line and the circle have only one common point. Haws cannot intersect each other, neither can circles in this problem.

<P>Statistical machine translation (SMT) is a machine translation paradigm where translations are generated on the basis of statistical models whose parameters are derived from the analysis of bilingual text corpora. The statistical approach contrasts with the rule-based approaches to machine translation as well as with example-based machine translation.<P>The first ideas of statistical machine translation were introduced by Warren Weaver in 1949, including the ideas of applying Claude Shannon's information theory. Statistical machine translation was re-introduced in 1991 by researchers at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center and has contributed to the significant resurgence in interest in machine translation in recent years. Nowadays it is by far the most widely-studied machine translation method.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="982" HEIGHT="361" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4767a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4767a.eps}"></DIV><P>In reality, we always wish to get the best translation by some naive methods. Although it sounds ridiculous, many people have tried once and once again. For example, if one would like to translate the Chinese sentence `` <IMG WIDTH="396" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4767a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4767b.eps}">'', one of the hypotheses will be ``I all poss friend all want eat chicken egg", eh <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN> looks so weird. However, it is obviously that nobody will use it since ``My friends all want to eat eggs" sounds much better than the previous abracadabra-like statement. People can easily tell them apart just because the latter is more common in daily life. ``More common" here means ``more likely" in daily conversation. How to measure the likelihood of a sentence? As is known to all, the unbeatable probability theory.<P>In order to model the sentence probability, we adopt an <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>-gram language model. For the statistical based NLP (natural language processing), the probability of a sentence <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>S</I> = <I>W</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>W</I><SUB>2</SUB>,...<I>W</I><SUB>n</SUB>)</SPAN>, according to the chain rule, is:<P><P></P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay"><I>P</I>(<I>S</I>) = <I>P</I>(<I>W</I><SUB>1</SUB>)<IMG WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="63" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4767a.png ALT="$\displaystyle \prod^{{n}}_{{i}}$"><I>P</I>(<I>W</I><SUB>i</SUB>| <I>W</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>W</I><SUB>2</SUB>,<SUP> ... </SUP>, <I>W</I><SUB>i-1</SUB>)</DIV><P></P><P>While in reality, due to the data sparseness, it's impossible to calculate the probability in such a way. A particle way is, to assume the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>W</I><SUB>i</SUB>| <I>W</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>W</I><SUB>2</SUB>,...<I>W</I><SUB>i-1</SUB>)</SPAN> only depends on the previous <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> - 1</SPAN> words, i.e., <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I><SUB>i-N+1</SUB>, <I>W</I><SUB>i-N+2</SUB>,...<I>W</I><SUB>i-1</SUB></SPAN>. In particular, we have unigram (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = 1</SPAN>, context-free grammar), bigram (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = 2</SPAN>), trigram (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = 3</SPAN>), and fourgram (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = 4</SPAN>). The most commonly used is trigram.<P><P><BR>Next, let's give some introduction on ``maximum likelihood".<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Maximum likelihood:</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>ml</SUB></SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>W</I><SUB>i</SUB>| <I>W</I><SUB>i-2</SUB>, <I>W</I><SUB>i-1</SUB>) = <I>C</I>(<I>W</I><SUB>i-2</SUB>, <I>W</I><SUB>i-1</SUB>, <I>W</I><SUB>i</SUB>)/<I>C</I>(<I>W</I><SUB>i-2</SUB>, <I>W</I><SUB>i-1</SUB>), <I>C</I>()</SPAN> stands for the occurrence numbers. This means the maximum likelihood estimation of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I>(<I>W</I><SUB>i</SUB>| <I>W</I><SUB>i-2</SUB>, <I>W</I><SUB>i-1</SUB>)</SPAN> equals to the ratio of occurrence numbers of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>W</I><SUB>i-2</SUB>, <I>W</I><SUB>i-1</SUB>, <I>W</I><SUB>i</SUB>)</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>W</I><SUB>i-2</SUB>, <I>W</I><SUB>i-1</SUB>)</SPAN>.<P>However, many possible word sequences may not be collected in the training corpus. If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>ml</SUB></SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>Wi</I>| <I>h</I>)</SPAN> is 0, then the probability of entire sentence becomes 0. E.g., if we only see ``Tom hate Jerry" in corpus, while we don't see anything like ``fish hate xxx", then <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>ml</SUB>(fish hate Jerry) = 0</SPAN>. So, we need to smooth the model. Smoothing is to allocate some probability mass from known events to unknown events (i.e., the events whose occurrence number is 0).<P>When smoothing, we must discount some probability mass from the maximum likelihood probability and give them to the unknown events.

<P>A directed graph with input and output (referred as DGIO hereafter) is a graph in which some nodes have dangling edges, such as the one shown in Figure 1, in which the dangling inputs are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN>, and the dangling outputs are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>e</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>f</I></SPAN>. A DGIO is ``sound" if every dangling input is connected with every dangling output through a directed path. The DGIO shown in Figure 1, for example, is unsound, as input <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN> is not connected with output <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>f</I></SPAN>, and input <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN> is not connected with output <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>e</I></SPAN>.<P>Given a DGIO, your first step is to determine whether it is sound. (easy, isn't it? keep reading) If it is unsound, ideally we would like to split it into a minimum number of sound DGIOs. Figures 2 and 3 show two ways to split the unsound DGIO in Figure 1. Figure 3 is a better split than Figure 2 as it splits Figure 1 into fewer DGIOs. Note, that after a split, the edges connecting different DGIOs become new dangling inputs / outputs.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="446" HEIGHT="256" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4768a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4768a.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Fig. 1 Unsound DGIO</DIV><P><P><BR><IMG WIDTH="490" HEIGHT="341" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4768a.png ALT="$\textstyle \parbox{.5\textwidth}{

<P>Google Suggest is a typical feature of the Google search box. It guesses what you're typing and offers suggestions in real time(Fig 1). Sometimes, we may mistype the keyword. For example, when we want to find the information of ``mcgrady"(a famouse NBA star), we mistyped it to ``macgrady"(Fig 2). The clever Google can still give you the right suggestions. It is amazing, isn't it?<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="960" HEIGHT="492" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4769a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4769a.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Fig 1: Google Suggest</DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="960" HEIGHT="514" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4769a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4769b.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Fig 2: Fuzzy Google Suggest</DIV><P>In this problem, your job is to implement a similar system.

<P>
Prof. Woodage met a problem in his research recently. In the record from his experimental 
device there were several ``events" with time stamps, and he wants to compare them with a 
group of previous records. Although the previous one was also got by the same device, its 
duration was longer and recorded more ``events". 

<P>
Mr. Woodage guesses that the record which 
was later recorded can be viewed as a segment of the previous one. As long as added by a 
time offset, they would more or less match. 

<P>
Now it's your chance to help him. Mr. Woodage 
has given you the two records, and he designs a method to evaluate how well do two records 
match with a time offset. Your task is telling him the best offset. 

<P>
The evaluation method is as follow:

<P>
<P><!-- MATH
 \begin{displaymath}
p(x)=\sum^{n}_{i=1} \min_{j\in[1,m]} |f_{i} + x - g_{j}|^{2}
\end{displaymath}

</DIV><P></P>
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> is the evaluate function given by Mr. Woodage, in which <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> denotes the offset time. 
Sequence <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>f</I></SPAN> reflects the time stamp lists of the new experiment while <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>g</I></SPAN> reflects the previous 
ones. 

<P>
It's obvious that the best offset <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> to match is the number that make <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> get its minimum. 
Notice that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> may not an integer. What's more, you should notice that in Mr. Woodage's 
function, more than one event in sequence <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>f</I></SPAN> match the same event in sequence <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>g</I></SPAN> is permitted.

Xiao Ming loves a game called ``Football Manager"(FM). In this game, you are a manager 
of a football team. You can buy or sell players, set the formation of the team, set which 
player to play which position. Xiao Ming is not so good at setting the formation, so he 
always uses a software called FM scout to help him set the formation and choose players. 
But by using this software, he loses most of the games. Then he starts to doubt the 
algorithm of the software, and invite you to help him write a program for choosing the 
formation and the players. 

<P>
As we all know, there is 11 players on the field for each 
team, and each player will play a specific position. We consider that only 8 positions, 
goalkeeper (GK), defender of center (DC), defender of left (DL), defender of right (DR), 
midfielder of center (MC), midfielder of left (ML), midfielder of right (MR), forward 
striker (FS), for simple. And there are several formations can be chosen. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Formation A:4-4-2 has 1GK, 2DCs, 1DL, 1DR, 2MCs, 1ML, 1MR, 2FSs 

<P>
Formation B:4-5-1 has 1GK, 2DCs, 1DL, 1DR, 3MCs, 1ML, 1MR, 1FS 

<P>
Formation C:4-3-3 has 1GK, 2DCs, 1DL, 1DR, 3MCs, 3FSs 

<P>
Formation D:3-5-2 has 1GK, 3DCs, 3MCs, 1ML, 1MR, 2FSs 

<P>
Formation E:3-6-1 has 1GK, 3DCs, 4MC, 1ML, 1MR, 1FS 

<P>
Formation F:5-3-2 has 1GK, 3DCs, 1DL, 1DR, 3MC, 2FSs 

<P>
Formation China:6-3-1 has 1GK, 4DCs, 1DL, 1DR, 3MC, 1FS 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Each player has a point in each position, 
which stands for how good he plays in that position. The higher point the player gets, 
the better he plays in that position. As the same, the higher point the formation gets, 
the better it is. You need to find out the best formation form the upper 7 formations 
for the team, and calculate the total points of this formation by adding the points of 
11 positions.

<P>The Blenjeel sand worms slither across the sandy surface of the planet Blenjeel. As the planet's only known inhabits, they protect their homeland by attacking and devouring from underneath anyone who steps foot on their planet.<P>Of course, the sand worms need to be strong, flexible, and able to slither as quietly as possible. All teenage sand worms are conscripted to a six-month boot camp, where they endure intense training. The most demanding of the training exercise is the famous ``wriggle test", which requires worm cadets to slither from one position to a parallel position several hundreds of feet away.

<P>``A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away<SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN>", so long ago, in fact, that the Empire did not exist and there were planets without space travel. In a far corner was a world in which the predominant pet, called <SPAN CLASS="textit">tayes</SPAN>, reproduced by budding. Once a <SPAN CLASS="textit">taye</SPAN> had separated from its parent, it took one time unit to mature to the point of breeding, which, coincidentally, was the length of time for a new bud to grow and separate from its parent. The <SPAN CLASS="textit">tayes</SPAN> are extremely long-lived, so that it became important to investigate how many someone might have, assuming that at time zero the person did not have a <SPAN CLASS="textit">taye</SPAN>, and at time one had acquired an immature one, freshly budded from the mature <SPAN CLASS="textit">taye</SPAN> belonging to a friend.<P>This ends up giving the following recurrence: <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I>(0) = 0, <I>T</I>(1) = 1, <I>T</I>(<I>n</I>) = <I>T</I>(<I>n</I> - 1) + <I>T</I>(<I>n</I> - 2)</SPAN>, for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> &gt; 1</SPAN>.<P>Computing at the time involved unsigned binary numbers with 24 bits.

<P>While attempting to evade some old and not-so-happy creditors of his, Han Solo crashed the Millennium Falcon on the ice-world of Hoth. Now he must get some sort of emergency signal working so that he can get rescued before his Wookiee friend becomes a fur-cicle or decides to eat a Hans-kabob. Can you help him?<P>Han managed to salvage a really bright laser that can be seen from light-years away, and thought that would make a good signal. The downside is that if he just shines it straight up into the sky, there would only be a minimal chance that someone happens to be in the path of the light to see it. Chewbacca, in the meantime, was playing with a bunch of highly-reflective, multi-faceted crystals he found in a cave nearby. Then, in a moment of inspiration, Han realized he could assemble a rescue beacon by shining the light down on the crystal, whose facets will in turn reflect the light into the sky in a multitude of directions!<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="717" HEIGHT="688" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4777.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4777.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1: A simplified, two-dimensional illustration of Han's rescue beacon.</DIV><P>The only problem that remains is in deciding which crystal to use as the light reflector. Each of the reflective crystals is a convex polyhedral shape whose surface consists solely of perfectly triangular facets, and can be fitted in the beacon in any orientation. Of course, the best crystal to use is the one that would reflect the laser beam (which consists of parallel light rays from a single direction) back in the greatest number of directions. In other words, you can think of the reflective merit of a crystal as simply the number of facets on it that you can see from any one viewing direction, as those are the facets that can be hit simultaneously by the laser beam. Given a description of the geometry of each of the crystals, can you compute the greatest number of directions the crystal can reflect the laser?<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input will consist of geometric descriptions of the crystals in Chewbacca's collection.

You can expect that when all facets of each crystal are assembled, they form a closed convex polyhedron. Lastly, no crystal will have a structure with any degeneracy that would cause ambiguity as to how many facets the laser can hit. In other words, it should not matter whether you consider facets parallel to the laser beam as capable of reflecting the beam or not - the test data have been constructed such that either interpretation would yield the same answer.

<P>As the Chief Weapons Officer of an Imperial Star Destroyer, one of your duties is the routine maintenance of laser turret panels. Each panel is a square composed of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>n</I></SPAN> turret sockets, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> of which house a turret. To avoid asymmetric wear and tear on the panel circuits, turrets should be regularly moved between sockets. Turrets are capable of rotating in-place in <SPAN CLASS="MATH">45<SUP>o</SUP></SPAN> increments, but may not fire in between such rotations. All turrets are aligned with the panel grid upon insertion.<P>The most important constraint on turret placement is that turrets should not ``conflict", meaning they should not be able to shoot each other. Thus, they must be positioned such that no two turrets on the same panel share the same grid horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. To streamline the process of turret maintenance and reduce placement errors, the Empire has mandated that all turret socket exchanges be performed as rotations or reflections of existing configurations, as conflict prevention is invariant under such transformations.<P>Given a valid (non-conflicting) <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>n</I></SPAN> panel configuration, there are three clockwise rotations: <SPAN CLASS="MATH">90<SUP>o</SUP></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">180<SUP>o</SUP></SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">270<SUP>o</SUP></SPAN>. In addition there are four mirror planes: vertical, horizontal, diagonal (across the cells where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>row</I> = <I>col</I></SPAN>), and anti-diagonal (across the cells where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>row</I> + <I>col</I> = <I>n</I> - 1</SPAN>). Thus there are eight Empire-approved configurations (some of which may be identical for configurations that are symmetric under rotation by <SPAN CLASS="MATH">90<SUP>o</SUP></SPAN> and/or <SPAN CLASS="MATH">180<SUP>o</SUP></SPAN>). <SPAN CLASS="textbf">Figure 1</SPAN> shows eight approved configurations for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> = 5</SPAN>, while <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Figure 2</SPAN> 
shows an example from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> = 6</SPAN> of a configuration with an <SPAN CLASS="MATH">180<SUP>o</SUP></SPAN> symmetry and an example from 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> = 4</SPAN> of a configuration with a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">90<SUP>o</SUP></SPAN> symmetry.

While the panel is a two-dimensional matrix, the nature of a valid configuration 
(that there is only one turret in each row) allows it to be represented by a one-dimensional 
vector, giving the column positions for the turret in each row. The top row of the panel 
has index zero, similar to the numbering of screen coordinates. 

<P>
Write a method that receives 
one valid panel configuration and computes, in the same one-dimensional form, the other seven 
configurations that are approved by the Empire under the rotations and reflections listed 
above. Specifically, your program is to write back the configuration received, followed by 
the configurations obtained by the <SPAN CLASS="MATH">90<SUP>o</SUP></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">180<SUP>o</SUP></SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">270<SUP>o</SUP></SPAN> rotations in that order followed by 
the reflections in the order vertical mirror, antidiagonal mirror, horizontal mirror, 
and diagonal mirror.

<P>It's well known in Star Wars culture that George Lucas was preoccupied with the number 1138.

Rejuvenated after the successful siege of Cloud City, Emperor Palpatine has commissioned 
you to begin construction of a new Imperial base on the forest moon of Endor. Endor, 
however, is home to a species of cuddly creatures known as the `Ewoks.' 

<P>
Having a soft 
spot in his otherwise callous heart for these Ewoks, Palpatine has ordered that none 
of the existing Ewok homes must be disturbed. Furthermore, he has asked that you make 
the base as large as possible in terms of total area, and that this area may be divided 
among up to three rectangular buildings. Help Palpatine in his quest for intergalactic 
domination! 

<P>
For this problem, you are provided a map of Endor in the form of an <!-- MATH

way that no two buildings overlap with each other, and no building is placed over an Ewok home.

<P>As an archaeologist studying the history of Sith rulers, you regularly need to quickly look up what ruler was in power for a given galactic year. Given a list of Sith rulers and the years they were in power, write a program that will display which ruler (or rulers) ruled for a specified year. Note that no two rulers ever ruled simultaneously. Further note that some years and months had no ruler at all as the empire was in disarray. Finally, some rulers led more than once, but always had a break in ruling before reassuming power (someone else ruled before they reassumed power).<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="274" HEIGHT="524" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4782.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4782.eps}"></DIV><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The first entry in the input file will be an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <!-- MATH

The first line of the entry will contain the name of the ruler, which will be no more than 30 characters in length. The second line of the entry will contain the galactic date the ruler assumed power, followed by a space, followed by the date the ruler left power. Both of these dates will be real numbers greater than 0 and less than 5,000. The second date is guaranteed to be greater than the first date. These real numbers will be listed with one digit of precision to the right of the decimal point. The digit to the right of the decimal point effectively represents a galactic month (starting at 0). For the date the ruler leaves power, the assumption is that the ruler always serves to the end of the month listed. More specifically, another ruler never assumes power the same month the previous ruler leaves power. The minimum time a ruler ever serves is one month (thus a ruler could serve from 1.1 to 1.1, and any ruler that follows must start no earlier than 1.2).<P>Following the entries for the Sith rulers will be an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN> <!-- MATH

<P>You're a droid, and you want to try to shoot a Jedi in the room. It's well known that a Jedi can block a laser with his light saber, so shooting him directly won't work. What you can do, though, is shoot two lasers in such a way that they hit him simultaneously from different angles, in which case he can't block both. Conveniently, the (square) room is mirrored, so you can bounce laser shots off the walls. However, these are not perfectly silvered mirrors, so each laser can only bounce a limited number of times before it dissipates.<P>As a droid, you have other tasks to complete, so you want to minimize the time spent between firing the two laser shots. You have two laser pistols and droid reflexes, so you can shoot them off at an arbitrarily small interval (including simultaneously).<P>The room is a square, 1,000,000 feet on each side. Its lower left corner is at <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(0, 0)</SPAN> and its upper right corner is at <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(1, 000, 000, 1, 000, 000)</SPAN>. You are at <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>1</SUB>)</SPAN> and the Jedi is at <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>2</SUB>)</SPAN>. A laser that bounces around and then passes through <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>1</SUB>)</SPAN> will continue along its path (you planned the shot, after all, so you can dodge it), but a laser immediately halts as soon as it hits <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>2</SUB>)</SPAN>. A laser fired at a wall follows the normal rules of reflection (<SPAN CLASS="textit">angle of incidence = angle of reflection</SPAN>, and reflection introduces no extra delay). A laser fired directly at a corner will rebound exactly opposite the direction it was fired, and will count as having bounced twice. For simplicity, assume the speed of light (and therefore of the laser) is 1 foot per nanosecond.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Each test case consists of a single line of 5 space-separated integers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> are as described above, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> is the maximum number of bounces. <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4783img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>2</SUB><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4783img1.png ALT="$ \le$">999, 999</SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4783img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>n</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/4783img1.png ALT="$ \le$">100</SPAN>.

After the untimely demise of its previous tenant, you have found yourself promoted to the 
position of the new ``chief architect" of the Death Star by none other than Lord Vader himself. 
Your have been tasked with designing the wiring system for distributing power throughout each 
sector of the Death Star. Knowing that your life depends on your success, you have decided to 
be extremely meticulous and exhaustively enumerate all valid wiring configurations so that you 
may choose the best one.

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>n</I></SPAN> grid, whose cells correspond to 
sectors. Exactly one of the sectors in the map is a power station; the remaining sectors are 
all either living quarters or storage units. You have the option of placing a connection between 
any two non-storage sectors that are either vertically or horizontally adjacent. 
A valid wiring configuration is one such that: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Every living quarter sector is either directly or indirectly connected to the power station 
sector, and 
</LI>
<LI>As few connections are used as possible (i.e., removing any connection would result in 
disconnecting some living quarter from the power station). 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>APL is an array programming language that uses a notation invented by Ken Iverson in 1957. In this problem we consider only a small subset of the language which we call <SPAN CLASS="textit">apl</SPAN> (that is, <SPAN CLASS="textit">small APL</SPAN>).<P><P><BR>Each <SPAN CLASS="textit">apl</SPAN> expression appears on a line by itself and each expression has a value, which is displayed immediately after the expression is entered.

Code-11 is a barcode system for encoding characters used primarily in labeling 
telecommunications equipment. The characters encoded are limited to digits 0 through 9, 
the dash (``-"), and a special start/stop character which appears at the beginning and end 
of each Code-11 barcode. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Code-11 is a discrete system, and each character is encoded independently. A character's 
encoding is represented by five adjacent regions, or bars, that alternate between a dark 
color and a light color, starting with a dark bar. The width of each bar is either narrow or 
wide, according to the encoding scheme shown below, where 0 represents a narrow bar and 1 
represents a wide bar.

<P>
Thus the character 1 is encoded as a wide dark bar, a narrow light bar, a narrow dark bar, a 
narrow light bar, and finally a wide dark bar. The barcodes for the individual characters 
must be separated by a narrow light bar whose only function is to separate the characters. 

<P>
A two-width encoding like that used for Code-11 has the benefit of simplicity. Since it is 
necessary only to distinguish a narrow bar from a wide bar, Code-11 allows for a large 
level of print tolerance in lower-quality printing conditions. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
To enable detection of errors, the Code-11 barcodes we use will have two check characters, 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>, added at the end of the message (before the stop character). If the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> characters 
to be encoded (left to right) are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> through <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I><SUB>n</SUB></SPAN>, then the weight of the C check 
character is

<BR>
Simple barcode readers measure the intensity of light reflected from a barcode to a linear 
array containing hundreds of tiny CCD sensors, each reporting light or dark. Light and 
dark regions are identified ,and the width of each region is used by the decoding software 
to validate the barcode and to obtain the encoded information. Since the orientation of 
the barcode is not fixed, the software must be able to decode the barcode whether it 
is scanned from left to right or from right to left. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Your problem is to decode the information obtained by scanning a Code-11 barcode, given the 
widths of the light and dark regions detected by the reader. Assume a wide bar is intended 
to be twice as wide as a narrow bar. Due to inconsistencies among printers, the width of a 
bar can be up to 5 percent larger or smaller than intended. There are no zero-length messages 
(with barcodes containing only start/stop, check characters, and intercharacter spacing).

<P>The researchers at International Bio-bot Makers (IBM) have invented a new kind of Bio-bot, a robot with behavior mimicking biological organisms. The development of the new robot is at a primitive stage; they now resemble simple four-wheeled rovers. And like most modern robots, Bio-bots are not very mobile.

Wars have played a significant role in world history. Unlike modern wars, armies in the 
middle ages were principally concerned with capturing and holding castles, the private 
fortified residences of lords and nobles. The size of the attacking army was an important 
factor in an army's ability to capture and hold one of these architectural masterpieces.

A certain minimum number of soldiers were required to capture a castle. Some soldiers were 
expected to die during the attack. After capturing the castle, some soldiers were required 
to remain in the castle to defend it against attacks from another enemy. Of course, those 
numbers were different for different castles. Commanders of the armies were obliged to 
consider the number of soldiers required for victory. For example, there are five castles 
in the region map shown in Figure 2. The castle at the lower right requires at least 20 
soldiers to wage a winning attack. None are expected to perish during the attack, and 10 
soldiers must be left in the castle when the army moves on. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
In this problem you must determine the minimum size of an army needed to capture and hold 
all the castles in a particular region. For reasons of security, there is exactly one 
(bi-directional) route between any pair of castles in the region. Moving into the 
neighborhood of an uncaptured castle begins an attack on that castle. Any castle can serve 
as the first castle to be attacked, without regard for how the army got there. Once any 
castle has been captured, the requisite number of soldiers is left in the castle to 
defend it, and the remainder of the army moves on to do battle at another castle, if any 
remain uncaptured. The army may safely pass through the neighborhood of a castle that it 
has already captured. But because of the potential for attacks, the army may traverse the 
route between a pair of castles no more than twice (that is, at most once in each direction).

<P>A contour map represents the topography of a given region. Lines on a contour map represent constant elevations. For example, a contour map might contain a line that represents points with an elevation of 100 meters above mean sea level, another line representing 200 meters elevation, and so on.<P><P><BR>The Association for Contour Mapping (ACM) needs a program to produce contour maps from data files containing elevation measurements collected by a satellite. They are especially interested in the total length of all contour lines on each map. The elevation data is in the form of sequences of integers that represent elevations measured at regular intervals along scan lines that run from west to east. The spacing of the scan lines is such that each elevation measurement in the interior of the data set has six nearest neighbors and is equidistant from them (when elevation is ignored), as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="1013" HEIGHT="392" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4790.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4790.eps}"></DIV><P>The policy of the ACM is to approximate the actual terrain by a set of triangles constructed by connecting each elevation measurement to its nearest neighbors by straight line segments. Each of these triangles is then treated as a planar surface, where the plane is determined by the coordinates, including elevation, of the vertices. If the triangles are projected onto the zero-elevation plane, they form a set of equilateral triangles.<P><P><BR>In the figures above, the black numbers represent elevation data and the red dashed lines and numbers represent contour lines. Figure 5 contains a single contour line at elevation 5. Figure 6 contains multiple contour lines at elevations 6 and 9. A contour line may pass through the interior of a triangle or run along an edge of a triangle.<P>Because of the way the data points are interlaced, even-numbered scan lines contain one more data point than odd-numbered scan lines.

<P>Wen Chen is the captain of a rescue boat. One of his important tasks is to visit a group of islands once a day to check if everything is all right. Captain Wen starts from the west-most island, makes a pass to the east-most island visiting some of the islands, then makes a second pass from the east-most island back to the first one visiting the remaining islands. In each pass Captain Wen moves steadily east (in the first pass) or west (in the second pass), but moves as far north or south as he needs to reach the islands. The only complication is that there are two special islands where Wen gets fuel for his boat, so he must visit them in separate passes.

<P>
In recent years, hurricanes and tsunamis have shown the destructive power of water. That 
destructive power is not restricted to the sea, however. Heavy rain may cause floods, 
destroying people's houses and fields. Using intricate models, scientists try to predict 
where the water will accumulate as a result of significant rain. 

<P>
One of the ways to model a hilly landscape is triangulation, which approximates a surface 
using triangles. Triangle sides are entirely shared between two adjacent triangles, with the 
exception of triangles at the region boundary, which may have some sides not shared. 

<P>
Imagine you have a triangulation model of a landscape. Now the rain starts pouring down - 
some water flows to the sea, and the rest gets trapped by the landscape to form lakes. 
Your task is to write a program that determines how many lakes are formed and the water 
level in each of them. Assume that the rain is heavy enough to fill all lakes up to their 
maximal levels. 

<P>
For any lake, it is possible to sail between any two points on its surface (except the 
boundaries) with a boat whose size is arbitrarily small, but not zero. Therefore, if two 
lakes share only points (or one point) having a zero depth, they are considered different 
lakes.

Inspired by the ice sculptures in Harbin, the members of the programming team from Arctic 
University of Robotics and Automata have decided to hold their own ice festival when they 
return home from the contest. They plan to harvest blocks of ice from a nearby lake when 
it freezes during the winter. To make it easier to monitor the thickness of the ice, they 
will lay out a rectangular grid over the surface of the lake and have a lightweight robot 
travel from square to square to measure ice thickness at each square in the grid. Three 
locations in the grid are specified as ``check-in" points and the robot is supposed to 
radio a progress report from these points when it is one-fourth, one-half, and three-fourths 
of the way through its tour of inspection. To avoid unnecessary wear and tear on the 
surface of the ice, the robot must begin its tour of the grid from the lower left corner, 
designated in (row,column) coordinates as (0,0), visiting every other grid location exactly 
once and ending its tour in row 0, column 1. Moreover, if there are multiple tours that the 
robot can follow, then a different one is to be used each day. The robot is able to move 
only one square per time step in one of the four compass directions: north, south, east, or 
west. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
You are to design a program that determines how many different tours are possible for a given 
grid size and a sequence of three check-in points. For example, suppose the lake surface is 
marked off in a <!-- MATH
 $3 \times 6$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">3 <TT>x</TT> 6</SPAN> grid and that the check-in points, in order of visitation, are 
(2,1), (2,4), and (0,4). Then the robot must start at (0,0) and end at (0,1) after visiting 
all 18 squares. It must visit location (2,1) on step 4 <!-- MATH

<P>Your company makes artistic paperweights. Each paperweight is the union of two tetrahedra that share one face. They are clear solid glass with embedded colored flecks. One of the little flecks in each paperweight is actually a tiny RFID chip. This chip must be placed close to a partnered computer in order for that computer to operate. Typically this is accomplished by placing the paperweight on top of the computer. The chip has a limited range, however, so its distance from the flat computer top is significant. Therefore, it is important to calculate the minimum and maximum possible distances from the chip to the computer top when the paperweight is in a sufficiently stable position. A position is considered sufficiently stable if the paperweight would not move if the center of mass were somehow shifted up to 0.2 units in any direction. You may assume the paperweight has uniform density, and that the chip is small enough to be considered a point.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="1126" HEIGHT="514" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/47/p4795.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4795.eps}"></DIV><P>As an example, consider a paperweight with the vertices of the common face at <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I> = (0, 0, 0)</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I> = (9, 0, 0)</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I> = (0, 8, 0)</SPAN>, the fourth vertex of one tetrahedron at <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I> = (0, 0, 9)</SPAN>, the fourth vertex of the other tetrahedron at <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I> = (1, 1, - 8)</SPAN>, and the chip at <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>F</I> = (1, 2, - 1)</SPAN>. (See Figure 10, where the chip is shown as a red dot.) Placing the paperweight with face BCD on the computer results in the maximum distance of approximately 3.7 (upper part of Figure 11). Placing the paperweight with face ACD on the computer results in the minimum distance of 1.0 (lower part of Figure 11). Placing the paperweight with face ACE on the computer results in a distance of only 0.9 but is not sufficiently stable.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains one or more test cases.

<P>A tour operator thought he had finally struck gold when he signed a long term binding contract with a local bus company to drive his customers between sites of his tours. According to the terms of the contract, the bus company will charge a flat fee per mile. Unfortunately, the Global Financial Crisis was not kind to him as the large number of expected customers turned to be a mirage, and his competitors slashed the prices of similar tours.<P>After some research he realized that he can retain his customers by reducing the cost of each tour. Such cost reduction can be achieved by reorganizing the order in which sites are visited to minimize the total distance traveled in each tour. The bad news is that reorganizing a tour to visit the same sites, possibly in a different order, to achieve the smallest possible distance is very hard task that may take months to perform. As a compromise, he settled on looking for reorganizations of his tours with guarantees that they are not much worse than the shortest possible.<P>Your task is to write a program that processes the given geographic locations, described by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>- and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>-coordinates, of sites to be visited in a tour, and plan a good tour to visit all of them.

<P>The 2010 graduating students of a college want to present their teacher with a special present in appreciation for his long hours of work with the poorly performing students of the class.

A tuple of three integers <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>A</I><SUB>g</SUB>, <I>A</I><SUB>n</SUB>, <I>A</I><SUB>l</SUB>)</SPAN> denotes a student's mark in the three categories of general abilities, numeracy, and literacy.

<P>A group of ants is really proud because they built a magnificent and large colony. However, the enormous size has become a problem, because many ants do not know the path between some parts of the colony. They desperately need your help!<P>The colony of ants was made as a series of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> anthills, connected by tunnels. The ants, obsessive as they are, numbered the anthills sequentially as they built them. The first anthill, numbered 0, did not require any tunnel, but for each of the subsequent anthills, 1 through <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> - 1</SPAN>, the ants also built a single tunnel that connected the new anthill to one of the existing anthills. Of course, this tunnel was enough to allow any ant to go to any previously built anthill, possibly passing through other anthills in its path, so they did not bother making extra tunnels and continued building more anthills.<P>Your job is, given the structure of the colony and a set of queries, calculate for each query the shortest path between pairs of anthills. The length of a path is the sum of the lengths of all tunnels that need to be traveled.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Each test case is given using several lines.

<P>Albert, Charles and Mary invented a new version of the classical game Bingo. In traditional Bingo the game is presided over by a non-player known as the caller. At the beginning of the game each player is given a card containing a unique combination of numbers from 0 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> arranged in columns and rows. The caller has a bag containing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> + 1</SPAN> balls, numbered from 0 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>. On each turn, the caller randomly selects a ball from the bag, announces the number of the drawn ball to the players, and sets the ball aside so that it cannot be selected again. Each player searches his card for the called number and marks it if he finds it. The first player who marks a complete pre-announced pattern on the card (for example, a full horizontal line) wins a prize.<P>In the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">A</SPAN>lbert-<SPAN CLASS="textbf">C</SPAN>harles-<SPAN CLASS="textbf">M</SPAN>ary version, on each turn, the caller draws a first ball, returns it to the bag, draws a second ball, returns it to the bag, and then calls out the absolute difference between the two ball numbers. To generate even more excitement, before the game started a possibly empty subset of balls is removed from the bag, in such a way that at least two balls remain there. They would like to know if every number from 0 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> may still be called out with the new drawing method considering the balls that were left in the bag.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Each test case is given using exactly two lines.

<P>You are going to construct a new factory in your city. Since you have major electric needs, having the factory placed close to a power plant is important. You want to build a prioritized list of possible locations.<P>The area in which the factory needs to be located can be represented as a rectangular grid of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> rows and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> columns of cells. Some of those cells contain a power plant. The new factory occupies exactly one cell, and can be placed in any empty cell (i.e., any cell that does not contain a power plant).<P>Numbering rows from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> and columns from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>, the location of a cell can be described by two integers. Cell <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>i</I>, <I>j</I>)</SPAN> is the cell in row <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> and column <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN>. The distance between cell <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>i</I><SUB>0</SUB>, <I>j</I><SUB>0</SUB>)</SPAN> and cell <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>i</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>j</I><SUB>1</SUB>)</SPAN> is max <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(| <I>i</I><SUB>0</SUB> - <I>i</I><SUB>1</SUB>|,| <I>j</I><SUB>0</SUB> - <I>j</I><SUB>1</SUB>|)</SPAN> where <SPAN CLASS="MATH">| <I>x</I>|</SPAN> represents the absolute value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>. The electric priority of a location is its minimum distance to a power plant.<P>With this in mind, you will number all possible locations with consecutive integers starting from 1. You will do it in ascending order of electric priority. Among locations with the same electric priority, you will number them in ascending order of their row numbers. Among locations with the same electric priority and row number, you will list them in ascending order of column numbers.<P>In the following picture you can see a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">4 <TT>x</TT> 7</SPAN> grid. Black cells are the cells in which there is a power plant. Dark gray cells have an electric priority of 1, light gray cells an electric priority of 2 and white cells an electric priority of 3.

<P>Gene and Gina have a particular kind of farm. Instead of growing animals and vegetables, as it is usually the case in regular farms, they grow strings. A string is a sequence of characters. Strings have the particularity that, as they grow, they add characters to the left and/or to the right of themselves, but they never lose characters, nor insert new characters in the middle.<P>Gene and Gina have a collection of photos of some strings at different times during their growth. The problem is that the collection is not annotated, so they forgot to which string each photo belongs to. They want to put together a wall to illustrate strings growing procedures, but they need your help to find an appropriate sequence of photos.<P>Each photo illustrates a string. The sequence of photos must be such that if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> comes immediately before <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I><SUB>i+1</SUB></SPAN> in the sequence, then <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I><SUB>i+1</SUB></SPAN> is a string that may have grown from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> (i.e., <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> appears as a consecutive substring of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I><SUB>i+1</SUB></SPAN>).

<P>The King of Logonia will inaugurate soon a new and revolutionary metro, based on an invention of the Royal Engineers, which allows teletransportation.<P>The new metro consists of a very long tunnel with a station at each kilometer. There are also <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> teletransporters, which are located at some of the stations. In each station there is a keyboard with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> keys, where each key corresponds to one teletransporter. The figure below illustrates a metro system with three teletransporters, located in stations marked A, B and C.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="960" HEIGHT="92" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/48/p4813.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4813.eps}"></DIV><P>The metro works as follows. The user goes in a station (the start station) and presses the key corresponding to the teletransporter he wants to use. The user is then teletransported to the station which is at the same distance from the teletransporter as the start station, but on the opposite side relative to the teletransporter. More precisely, if the location of the start station is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> and the user presses the key corresponding to the teletransporter located in position <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN>, he will be taken to the station located at position <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2 <TT>x</TT> <I>j</I> - <I>i</I></SPAN>. For example, if the user is in station 6 and wants to go to station -2, he can use the teletransporter C (goes from 6 to 10) and then the teletransporter A (goes from 10 to -2).<P>The King, however, knows that it is possible that there is no sequence of teletransporters that will take the user from a given station <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> to a given station <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>. To avoid that the users keep trying to go where they cannot go, he wants to make a program available in the Internet to help users. The King wants you to write a program which, given the position of each teletransporter, answers a series of queries. For each query the start and the destination stations are given, and your program must determine if it is possible for the user to go from start to destination.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Each test case is given using several lines.

Jollo is a simple card game which the children from Logonia love to 
play. It is played between two players with a normal deck of 52 cards. 
In the game, cards are ordered according to their rank and suit, 
forming a sequence of 52 distinct values. 

<P>
The game is composed of three rounds, played in a best-of-three series 
(a player must win two rounds to win the game). At the beginning of 
the game the deck is shuffled and each player is given a hand of 
three cards. In each round the players show one card to each other 
and the player with the highest card wins the round. The cards shown 
in a round are discarded (i.e., they cannot be shown again). 

<P>
The King's son loves to play the game. But he is not very smart, 
losing frequently to his little sister. And when he loses, he cries 
so loud no one can stand it. The servant who deals the cards to the 
Prince and his sister is afraid he will be sent to prison if the 
Prince continues to lose. The servant is allowed to see every card 
he deals, and after dealing five cards (three to the Princess and 
two to the Prince) he wants to know which is the lowest card he 
should deal to the Prince so that there is no chance he will lose 
the game, no matter how badly he plays.

Kevin is a kid. He has lunch at school together with many more kids. 
They use to go outdoors and have lunch sitting on the ground. They 
love to form a big circle in which each kid has exactly two neighbors, 
one on the left and one on the right. Sometimes the teacher has 
problems arranging the circle because some kids wish to sit down 
next to other kids. Each kid may wish to sit down next to at most 
two other kids, because each kid has just two neighbors in the circle. 
The teacher wants to know whether it is possible to arrange the circle 
in such a way that all kids' wishes are satisfied. You clean up the 
place when the lunch ends. Since you want to finish your work as early 
as possible, help the teacher in answering that question.

<P>
It's well-known that different programming contests require different 
kind of problems. For example, maximal array size for TopCoder 
problem is only 50, and you definitely can not give a Suffix Tree 
problem to IOI because children will not have a chance to solve it 
(except of some touristic-inclined ones). Thus not every problem is 
acceptable for every contest. 

<P>
You are preparing problemsets for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> different contests. These 
contests require different number of problems, depending of type. 
For example, ACM ICPC style problemset usually has 10 problems, 
TopCoder SRM - 5 and so on. 

<P>
Luckily you have already prepared <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> different problems. For each 
problem you have determined a set of contests you can give that 
problem to. Also you know the required number of problems for 
each contest. 

<P>
Find out the maximal number of different contests for which you can 
simultaneously compose <SPAN  CLASS="textit">complete</SPAN> problemsets from the given set of 
problems. All problems in the problemsets must be unique, i.e. no 
problem can be used twice in different problemsets.

the number of prepared problems. Each of the following <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> lines 
contains the name of contest, followed by the required number of 
problems for that contest. The name of a contest consists of 
lower - and uppercase Latin letters and/or digits, is not empty and 
does not exceed 100 characters. Contest names are case-sensitive. 
It's guaranteed that all contest names will be pairwise different. 
The required number of problems does not exceed 100. 

<P>
Each of the following <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> lines contains a (possibly empty) list of

As you probably know, the streets and crossroads of Bucharest form a 
perfect grid. What you probably don't know, is that there is exactly 
one gaming club and exactly one gamer on each of these crossroads. 
Strangely enough, each gaming club offers exactly one game. Gamers 
are also a bit strange, but they generally live a simple life, 
determined by the following rules: 

<P>

<OL>
<LI>A gamer never plays in the club of his own crossroads. Never!!! 
</LI>
<LI>During a day each gamer has to play each of the games when this 
is not contradicting the Rule 1. 
</LI>
<LI>Gamers travel from one crossroads to another only by horizontals 
or verticals. 
</LI>
<LI>A gamer can not go directly from one club to another. It has to 
come back home and eat something first and has to finish the day in 
his own intersection. 
</LI>
<LI>A gamer has to live optimally, thus always picking the best 
possible strategy to implement the above rules, so that she has 
enough time for gaming. 
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Having in mind that all the gamers are the same, the Association of 
Computer Maniacs decided that the city should be optimized in order 
to minimize the total non-gaming effort. The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">non-gaming effort</SPAN> is 
the number of crossroads that a gamer walks trough the day. 
The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">total non-gaming effort</SPAN> is the sum of the non-gaming 
efforts for all gamers in the city. In order to perform the 
optimizations, ACM needs a program that calculates the total 
non-gaming effort for a given description of the city.

<B>Explanation of samples:</B>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>In first case, each of the four gamers has to play 
games 1 and 2. Hopefully, both are only one intersection away, 
so the non-gaming effort for each gamer is 4 (from home to club 
1, from club 1 to home, from home to club 2 and from club 2 to 
home). That means a total non-gaming effort of 16. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>In the second case, each of the 9 gamers has two of the games 1 
intersection away, and one - 2 intersections away, meaning total 
non-gaming effort of <!-- MATH

<P>The young programmers Peter and Stancu were hired by two cosmic agencies. The agency of Peter constructed a station, composed of modules. Some couples of modules are linked by corridors in such way that it is possible to go from each module to each other module by unique path of corridors. There is neither a corridor that starts and finishes in the same module nor two or more corridors that link same two modules. <SPAN CLASS="textit">Outside</SPAN> modules are linked to exactly one other module (white on the figure) and are labeled from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>. They are just for fun. All equipment of the station is concentrated in the <SPAN CLASS="textit">inner</SPAN> modules - linked to more than one other module (black on the figure). The chiefs of Peter would like to keep in secret the number of inner modules.

<P>Once upon a time, there lived a kind of fairy in the world. Those fairies could hear the voice of fruit trees, and helped people with a harvest. But people didn't know that fruits are also those fairies' favorite food. After the fairies ate people's fruits, they always did something to cover it up.<P>One day a little fairy named Lily flew into an orchard and found a large peach tree. Hungry as Lily was, she started eating without thinking until her stomach was full. In the fairy world, when a fairy ate the fruits in a fruit tree, sometimes the fruit tree would feel honored and bore more fruits immediately. That's why sometimes the number of fruits in a tree got increased after a fairy ate fruits of that tree.<P>But the fairies didn't want people to find out weird things such as fruits become more or less suddenly.

His thinking circuit was changed by human and thus became a tyrant. All those who are against him were put into jail, including our clever Micheal#1.

Of course, Micheal#1 cannot move when his battery contains no energy.<P>The larger the battery is, the more energy it can save.

<P>
The ``dream architect" is the key role in a team of ``dream extractors" 
who enter other's dreams to steal secrets. A dream architect is 
responsible for crafting the virtual world that the team and the 
target will dream into. To avoid the target noticing the world is 
artificial, a dream architect must have powerful 3D imagination. 

<P>
Cobb uses a simple 3D imagination game to test whether a candidate has 
the potential to be an dream architect. He lets the candidate imagine 
a cube consisting of <!-- MATH
 $n \times n \times n$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>n</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>n</I></SPAN> blocks in a 3D coordinate 
system as Figure 1. The block at bottom left front corner is marked 
(1, 1, 1) and the diagonally opposite block is marked (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>). 
Then he tells the candidate that the blocks on a certain line are 
eliminated. The line is always parallel to an axis. After <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> such block 
eliminations, the candidate is asked to tell how many blocks are 
eliminated. Note that one block can only be eliminated once even if 
it is on multiple lines.

You are probably not familiar with the title, ``Gomoku", but you must 
have played it a lot. Gomoku is an abstract strategy board game and is 
also called Five in a Row, or GoBang. It is traditionally played with 
go pieces (black and white stones) on a go board (<!-- MATH
 $19 \times 19$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">19 <TT>x</TT> 19</SPAN> 
intersections). Nowadays, standard chessboard of Gomoku has <!-- MATH
 $15 \times 15$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">15 <TT>x</TT> 15</SPAN> 
intersections. Black plays first, and players alternate in placing a 
stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first 
player to get an unbroken row of five or more stones horizontally, 
vertically, or diagonally.

<P>

 ALT="\epsfbox{p4836.eps}">
</DIV>

<P>
For convenience, we coordinate the chessboard as illustrated above. The 
left-bottom intersection is (0,0). And the bottom horizontal edge is 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>-axis, while the left vertical line is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>-axis. 

<P>
I am a fan of this game, actually. However, I have to admit that I don't 
have a sharp mind. So I need a computer program to help me. What I want 
is quite simple. Given a chess layout, I want to know whether someone can 
win within 3 moves, assuming both players are clever enough. Take the 
picture above for example. There are 31 stones on it already, 16 black 
ones and 15 white ones. Then we know it is white turn. The white player 
must place a white stone at (5,8). Otherwise, the black player will win 
next turn. After that, however, the white player also gets a perfect 
situation that no matter how his opponent moves, he will win at the 
3-rd move.

<P>
So I want a program to do similar things for me. Given the number of 
stones and positions of them, the program should tell me whose turn 
it is, and what will happen within 3 moves.

First of all, the program should check whose turn next. Let's call the 
player who will move next ``Mr. Lucky". Obviously, if the number of the 
black stone equals to the number of white, Mr. Lucky is the black

of white, Mr. Lucky is the white player. If it is not the first

Josh Lyman is a gifted painter. One of his great works is a glass 
painting. He creates some well-designed lines on one side of a thick 
and polygonal glass, and renders it by some special dyes. The most 
fantastic thing is that it can generate different meaningful paintings 
by rotating the glass. This method of design is called ``Rotational 
Painting (RP)" which is created by Josh himself. 

<P>
You are a fan of Josh and you bought this glass at the astronomical sum 
of money. Since the glass is thick enough to put erectly on the table, 
you want to know in total how many ways you can put it so that you can 
enjoy as many as possible different paintings hiding on the glass. We 
assume that material of the glass is uniformly distributed. If you 
can put it erectly and stably in any ways on the table, you can enjoy 
it. 

<P>
More specifically, if the polygonal glass is like the polygon in Figure 
1, you have just two ways to put it on the table, since all the other 
ways are not stable. However, the glass like the polygon in Figure 2 
has three ways to be appreciated.

<P>
Could you imaging a monkey writing computer programs? Surely monkeys are 
smart among animals. But their limited intelligence is no match for our 
human beings. However, there is a theorem about monkeys, and it states 
that monkeys can write everything if given enough time. 

<P>
The theorem is called ``Infinite monkey theorem". It states that a monkey 
hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount 
of time will almost surely type any given text, which of course includes 
the programs you are about to write (All computer programs can be 
represented as text, right?). 

<P>
It's very easy to prove this theorem. A little calculation will show you 
that if the monkey types for an infinite length of time the probability 
that the output contains a given text will approach 100%. 

<P>
However, the time used is too long to be physically reasonable. The monkey 
will not be able to produce any useful programs even if it types until 
the death of the universe. To verify this and ensure that our human 
beings are not replaceable by monkeys, you are to calculate the 
probability that a monkey will get things right.

typewriter will finally produce an output of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> characters. 

<P>
The following <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> lines describe keys on the typewriter. Each line has a 
lower case letter and a real number separated by a whitespace. The 
letter indicates what the typewriter will produce if the monkey hits 
that key and the real number indicates the probability that the monkey 
will hit this key. Two hits of the monkey are independent of each other 
(Two different hits have the same probability for a same key), and sum 
of all the probabilities for each key is ensured to be 1. 

<P>
The last line of the test case contains a word composed of lower case 
letters. The length of the word will be less than or equal to 10. 

<P>
The input will end with a line of two zeros separated by a whitespace. 
This line should not be processed.

the number of previous days whose sales amounts are less than or equal to it. After obtaining the number of such days, he writes it in 
a list.

We are given a string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> of two characters `<TT>a</TT>' and `<TT>b</TT>'. Let a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">group</SPAN> be a maximal consecutive substring of 
the same character. 
Any group <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>g</I></SPAN> of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> of length at least two can be removed (or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">popped</SPAN>) and a new string is constructed by concatenating the 
remaining left 
and right substrings of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>. We repeat this process until either the string becomes the empty string or there is no more group of length 
at least two.

For example, string <!-- MATH

Shoulder-surfing is the behavior of intentionally and stealthily watching the screen of another person's electronic device, such as 
laptop computer or mobile phone. Since mobile devices prevail, it is getting serious to steal personal information by shoulder-surfing. 

<P>
Suppose that we have a smart phone. If we touch the screen keyboard directly to enter the password, this is very vulnerable since a 
shoulder-surfer easily knows what we have typed. So it is desirable to conceal the input information to discourage shoulder-surfers 
around us. Let me explain one way to do this. 

<P>
You are given a <!-- MATH
 $6 \times 5$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">6 <TT>x</TT> 5</SPAN> grid. Each column can be considered the visible part of a wheel. 
So you can easily rotate each column wheel independently to make password characters visible. In this problem, we assume that each 
wheel contains the 26 upper letters of English alphabet. See the following Figure 1.

Assume that we have a length-5 password such as <!-- MATH
 $p_1 \ p_2 \ p_3 \ p_4 \ p_5$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>1</SUB>&nbsp;<I>p</I><SUB>2</SUB>&nbsp;<I>p</I><SUB>3</SUB>&nbsp;<I>p</I><SUB>4</SUB>&nbsp;<I>p</I><SUB>5</SUB></SPAN>. 
In order to pass the authentication procedure, we should construct a configuration of grid space where each <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> appears in the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>-th 
column of the grid. In that situation we say that the user password is accepted.

<P>
Let me start with one example. Suppose that our password was set `COMPU'. If we construct the grid as shown in Figure 2 on next page, 
then the authentication is successfully processed.

<P>
In this password system, the position of each password character in each 
column is meaningless. If each of the 5 characters in <!-- MATH
 $p_1 \ p_2 \ p_3 \ p_4 \ p_5$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>1</SUB>&nbsp;<I>p</I><SUB>2</SUB>&nbsp;<I>p</I><SUB>3</SUB>&nbsp;<I>p</I><SUB>4</SUB>&nbsp;<I>p</I><SUB>5</SUB></SPAN> appears in the corresponding column, that can be 
considered the 
correct password. So there are many grid configurations allowing one password. Note that the sequence of letters on each wheel is 
randomly determined for each trial and for each column. In practice, the user is able to rotate each column and press ``Enter" 
key, so a should-surfer cannot perceive the password by observing the <!-- MATH
 $6 \times 5$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">6 <TT>x</TT> 5</SPAN> grid since there are too many password candidates. 
In this <!-- MATH
 $6 \times 5$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">6 <TT>x</TT> 5</SPAN> grid space, maximally <!-- MATH
 $6^5 =7,776$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">6<SUP>5</SUP> = 7, 776</SPAN> cases are possible. This is the basic idea of the proposed password system against 
shoulder-surfers. 

<P>
Unfortunately there is a problem. If a shoulder-surfer can observe more than two grid plate configurations 
for a person, then the shoulder-surfer can reduce the searching space and guess the correct password. Even though it is not easy to 
stealthily observe other's more than once, this is one weakness of implicit grid passwords. 

<P>
Let me show one example with two 
observed configurations for a grid password. The user password is `COMPU', but `DPMAG' is also one candidate password derived 
from the following configuration.

You are given two configurations of grid password from a shoulder-surfer. Suppose that you have succeeded to stealthily record snapshots 
of the target person's device (e.g. smart phone). Then your next task is to reconstruct all possible passwords from these two snapshots. 
Since there are lots of password candidates, you are asked for the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>-th password among all candidates in lexicographical order. In Figure 3, 
let us show the first 5 valid password. The first 5 valid passwords are `ABGAG' , `ABGAS', `ABGAU', `ABGPG' and `ABGPS'. 

<P>
The number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> is given in each test case differently. If there does not exist a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>-th password since k is larger than the number of all

To search for a node with a key <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> in a binary search tree <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>, we begin at the root. If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> is empty, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> contains no keys and the search is 
unsuccessful. Otherwise, we compare <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> with the key in root. If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> equals root's key, then the search terminates successfully. If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> is 
less than root's key, we search the left subtree of the root. If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> is larger than root's key, we search the right subtree of the root. 
In the same way, we can proceed the search in the left or right subree of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>. 

<P>
To insert a new key <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> into a binary search tree <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> is 
different from those of existing keys in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>, we first search the tree <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>. The search will be unsuccessful, then we insert the key at the 
point the search terminated. For instance, to insert a key 80 into the Figure 1(a), we first search the tree for 80. This search terminates 
unsuccessfully, and the last node examined has key 40. We insert a new node containing 80 as the right child of the node. The resulting 
search tree is shown in Figure 1(b). 

<P>
In this problem, we consider binary search trees with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> keys <!-- MATH

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I><SUB>1</SUB>&nbsp;<I>a</I><SUB>2</SUB>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<I>a</I><SUB>N</SUB></SPAN> successively into an initially empty binary 
search tree will produce a binary 
search tree. For instance, the permutation 2 1 4 3 5 will produce the tree in Figure 1(c). Also, 2 4 3 1 5 will produce the same tree. 
Actually, 8 permutations among all possible permutations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 will produce the same tree to the tree in Figure 1(c).

Korea has many tourist attractions. One of them is an archipelago (Dadohae in Korean), a cluster of small islands scattered in the 
southern and western coasts of Korea. The Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) plans to promote a new tour program on these islands. 
For this, The KTO wants to designate two or more islands of the archipelago as a tour belt. 

<P>
There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> islands in the archipelago. 
The KTO focuses on the synergy effect created when some islands are selected for a tour belt. Synergy effects are assigned to several 
pairs of islands. A synergy effect <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>SE</I>(<I>u</I>, <I>v</I>)</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>SE</I>(<I>v</I>, <I>u</I>)</SPAN> between two islands <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>u</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> is a positive integer which represents 
a value anticipated when both <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>u</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> 
are included in a tour belt. The KTO wants to select two or more islands for the tour belt so that the economic benefit of the tour 
belt is as high as possible. 

<P>
To be precise, we define a connected graph <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I> = (<I>V</I>, <I>E</I>)</SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN> is a set of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> vertices and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN> is a set of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> edges. Each 
vertex of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN> represents an island in the archipelago, and an edge <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>u</I>, <I>v</I>)</SPAN> of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN> exists if a synergy effect <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>SE</I>(<I>u</I>, <I>v</I>)</SPAN> is defined 
between two distinct 
vertices (islands) <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>u</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN>. Let <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> be a subset consisting of at least two vertices in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN>. An edge <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>u</I>, <I>v</I>)</SPAN> is an 
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">inside edge</SPAN> of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> if both <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>u</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> are in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>. 
An edge <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>u</I>, <I>v</I>)</SPAN> is a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">border edge</SPAN> of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> if one of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>u</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> is in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> and the other is not in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>.

border edge of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>. 
A candiate will be chosen as the final tour belt by the KTO. There can be many possible candidates in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I></SPAN>. Note that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN> itself is a candidate 
because there are no border edges. The graph in Figure 1(a) has three candidates {1,2}, {3,4} and {1,2,3,4}, but {2,3,4} is not a 
candidate because there are inside 
edges whose synergy effects are not larger than those of some border edges. The graph in Figure 1(b) contains six candidates,
 {1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6}, {7,8}, {3,4,5,6} and {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}. 
But {1,2,7,8} is not a candidate because it does not form a connected subgraph of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I></SPAN>, i.e., there are no edges 
connecting {1,2} and {7,8}.

Believe it or not, the streets of ACM city are laid out in an exact grid pattern, as shown in Figure 1. Each crossing in the streets is 
indentified with its vertical and horizontal street number. Some buildings in this city are so important that they need to be under 
surveillance by the police at all time. Since each building occupies an entire block of the streets, we can simply think of it as a 
cell of the grid. For an example, the black cells in Figure 1 represent important buildings. The building numbered 1 is located at a 
block surrounded by four crossings (3,7), (3,8), (4,7) and (4,8). 

<P>
The APD (ACM Police Department) decided to assign one police officer 
to each of the important buildings and let them keep watch of the buildings. The police officer must reside at one of the four crossings 
surrounding the building he is in charge of. For an example, the officer in charge of building 1 in Figure 1 has to reside at one of the 
four crossings (3,7), (3,8), (4,7), and (4,8). 

<P>
The officers should be able to communicate with each other. Since the chief of police was 
a huge fan of toys, he got rid of all walkie-talkies in the department, and instead forced the officers to use ``string phones". 
As you may know, a string phone is made of two paper cups (or, sometimes, two steel cans) linked by a string. For a string phone to 
work properly, the string should be kept tight. Since strings cannot pass though the buildings, they always run along the streets. 
Therefore, for two officers located at crossings <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>1</SUB>)</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>2</SUB>)</SPAN>, respectively, to be able to communicate, the length of the 
string phone they share must be equal to <!-- MATH
 $|x_1-Â­x_2|+|y_1-Â­y_2|$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">| <I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB> - <I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB>| + | <I>y</I><SUB>1</SUB> - <I>y</I><SUB>2</SUB>|</SPAN>, which is called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">the shortest distance along the streets</SPAN> between the 
two crossings.

<P>
Now, you have to help the officers to find their locations so that every string phone they have works properly. You are given the 
locations of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> important buildings which are numbered from 1 through <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>. The buildings are apart from each other enough for no two 
buildings to have a crossing surrounding them in common. You are also given information about which couples of the officers share 
string phones and what the lengths of the strings are. This information is given as a form of weighted connected graph as depicted 
in Figure 2(a). Node <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>, <!-- MATH
 $i=1,2,\dots,n$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> = 1, 2,..., <I>n</I></SPAN>, of the graph represents the officer who is in charge of building <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>. The existence of an edge 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>i</I>, <I>j</I>)</SPAN> implies that two officers in charge of buildings <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN>, respectively, share a string phone, and the weight of the edge represents 
the length of the string phone. This graph is always a connected graph. Your goal is to determine if it is possible to locate <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> officers 
so that every string phone works properly. Figure 2(b) shows an example of such locations for our example. In Figure 2(b), the small 
circles denote the crossings at which the officers are located. You can easily verify that the shortest distances along the streets 
between them are all met by the lengths of the string phones they have.

In the morning, service engineers in a telecom company receive a list of jobs which they must serve today. They install telephones, 
internet, ipTVs, etc and repair troubles with established facilities. A client requires a deadline when the requested job must be 
completed. But the engineers may not complete some jobs within their deadlines because of job overload. For each job, we consider, 
as a penalty of the engineer, the difference between the deadline and the completion time. It measures how long the job proceeds
after its deadline. The problem is to find a schedule minimizing the sum of the penalties of the jobs with the two largest penalties.

Mr. Kim is planning to open a new restaurant. His city is laid out as a grid with size <!-- MATH
 $M \times M$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>M</I></SPAN>. Therefore, every road is horizontal or 
vertical and the horizontal roads (resp., the vertical roads) are numbered from 0 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I> - 1</SPAN>. For profitability, all restaurants are located 
near road junctions. The city has two big apartments which are located on the same horizontal road. The figure below shows an example 
of a city map with size <!-- MATH
 $11 \times 11$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">11 <TT>x</TT> 11</SPAN>. A circle represents an existing restaurant and a circle labeled with `A' or `B' represents 
the location of an apartment. Notice that a restaurant is already located at each apartment. Each road junction is represented by the 
coordinate of the ordered pair of a vertical road and a horizontal road. The distance between two locations <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>1</SUB>)</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>2</SUB>)</SPAN> is 
computed as <!-- MATH

Mr. Kim knows that the residents of the two apartments frequently have a meeting. So, he thinks that the best location of a new 
restaurant is halfway between two apartments. Considering lease expenses and existing restaurants, however, he can't select the 
optimal location unconditionally. Hence he decides to regard a location satisfying the following condition as a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">good place</SPAN>. Let 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>dist</I>(<I>p</I>, <I>q</I>)</SPAN> be the distance between <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I></SPAN>.

In the above figure, the location <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(7, 4)</SPAN> is a good place. 
But the location <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I> = (4, 6)</SPAN> is not good because there is no apartment which is closer to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> than the restaurant at <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I> = (3, 5)</SPAN>, i.e.,

KTX (Korea Train eXpress), Korea's high-speed rail system operated by KORAIL, connects the capital Seoul to several major cities of 
the Korean Peninsula. KORAIL's most recent train sets KTX-II, which were developed in Korea, can travel at over 350 km/h. The 
next-generation test train is currently being developed, and the train is planned to be able to travel at over 400 km/h by 2012. KTX 
Goyang Train Depot, which is located behind Haengsin Station, is one of the biggest train depots in Korea. The train depot consists of 
a set of parallel tracks for storing KTX trains and facilities for carrying out repair jobs. 

<P>
All trains whose home is KTX Goyang Train 
Depot enter the depot until the middle of the night and leave it in the morning. Each train might enter the depot either from the eastern 
side or from the western side and might leave the depot to the eastern side or to the western side. The direction from which it enters or 
to which it leaves the depot, however, is fixed. Also the arrival and departure times are fixed. Hence, the train is labeled with the time 
interval <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[<I>t</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>t</I><SUB>2</SUB>]</SPAN> in which it stays in the depot and an arrival and departure direction <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>, respectively. For example, a train 
labeled [-6E,13W] is a train that enters the depot at time -6 from the eastern side and leaves the depot at time 13 to the western side. 
In the meanwhile, it stops on one of several parallel tracks in the depot. 

<P>
No two trains arrive from the same direction at the same time 
or depart to the same direction at the same time. There might be several trains waiting at the same track. Each train is assigned to a 
track such that it can leave the depot on time without being blocked by other trains. That is, the assignment of Figure 1 is not feasible, 
since train [-2E,2W] would be blocked by train [-1W,4W]. The assignments in Figures 2(a) and 2(b) are both feasible. However, an interesting 
assignment is the one in Figure 2(b), which uses the minimum number of tracks.

It is planned to increase the number of KTX trains whose home is KTX Goyang Train Depot. Dr. Chwa, who is the President of KORAIL Research 
Institute, foresees that it might cause a difficulty in storing trains in the depot due to the limit on the number of tracks. The length 
of a track will be no problem since each track is long enough to store even all the trains. Dr. Chwa is eager to determine the minimum 
number of tracks to store all the trains such that each train can leave the depot on time without being blocked by other trains. Write 
a program that can help him.

We have a very famous and popular fellow in our problemsetters' panel. 
He is so famous that his name is immaterial. Some of his admirers have 
recently given him the nickname 'Emoogle'. Let's stick to that name in 
our discussion for now. Being such a kind, friendly and generous person 
as he is, Emoogle is often known to give treats to the other 
problemsetters. Some times, there is a strange rumor in the air that 
his treats are mostly due to the fact that, if he is not sparing enough 
for those treats, 'problems' are likely to be created. But let's not pay 
heed to such nonsense!

There are around 75 test cases in the input file. Each test case 
describes a series of events. A test case starts with an integer

case. This integer is followed by a line with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> integers, each 
describing an event. These integers have values between 0 and 99 
(inclusive). A value between 1 and 99 means a reason for Emoogle's

<P>
The end of input will be denoted by a case with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = 0</SPAN>. This

The government of ``Moderdesh" is planning to enter the digital age and 
so people of different profession and business are proposing different 
ways to enter that age successfully. The hardware vendors are saying 
that we need to provide a laptop for each student, the mobile companies 
are saying that every children needs to have a mobile phone in his 
small hand and talk all night long, the multimedia experts are crying 
for Multimedia University and so on. But very few are crying for the 
overall improvement of Computer Science education. We do not understand 
that by being only the consumer of modern digital technologies we 
cannot enter the real digital age.

Now as a protest, some local computer geeks are planning to digitize 
the local vegetable and grocery markets in a strange way. The local 
markets generally use weighing balances as shown in the figure-1 and 
they use conventional weight sets as shown in figure 2. The computer 
geeks want to introduce a new type of weight set, where each piece 
will have the shape of an upper case English alphabet, and strangely 
Figure 1: The weighing balance weighing a Figure 2: the weights of 
these pieces will papaya using letter shaped weights. Conventional 
weight set be related with their ASCII valuess. For example the 
ASCII value of `<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">A</SPAN>' is <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">65</SPAN>, which is 
<!-- MATH
 $1000001_{2}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1000001<SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> in binary. For each `<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">1</SPAN>' in binary 
representation a weight of <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">500</SPAN> gms will be added and for 
each `<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">0</SPAN>' in binary representation a weight of <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">250</SPAN> gms 
will be added. So a piece with shape `<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">A</SPAN>' actually weighs 
<!-- MATH
 $(250 \ast 5+2 \ast 500)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(250 <TT>*</TT> 5 + 2 <TT>*</TT> 500)</SPAN> gm = <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">2250</SPAN> grams. Note that 
leading zeroes in binary representation are not considered. The geeks 
believe if others are correct about their ways to enter digital age, 
they are also correct about digitizing the local markets by introducing 
new weight sets related to ASCII characters. 

<P>
Now in this problem you will be given (i) the picture of a weighing 
scale and the weight pieces that it contains in left pan and in the 
right pan (ii) You will also be informed which pan is heavier and 
which pan is lighter (Not necessarily correct). You will have to 
detect whether the given information is correct or not. If the given 
information is not correct you will have to rectify the picture and 
show it in the output.

Each set of input is given in a <!-- MATH

<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(7 <TT>*</TT> 18)</SPAN> grid. This grid actually 
contains the plain text description of a weighing scale. Each location 
of the grid is either a dot `<code>.</code>' (ASCII value 46) or a front 
slash `<code>/</code>' (ASCII Value 47) or a back slash `<code>\</code>' (ASCII 
value 92) or an under score `<code>_</code>' (ASCII value 95) or a pipe

<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(7 <TT>*</TT> 18)</SPAN> grid is divided into two equal parts by two 
vertical lines formed with pipe character. The left part denotes the 
status of left pan and right part denotes the status of the right pan. 
The bottom of the pan is formed with <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">6</SPAN> (six) under score 
characters and the ropes attached to the pans are formed with front 
slash and back slash. The weights on both pans are placed just above 
the row that denotes bottom of the pan and they are left justified. 
There can be maximum 6 weights on a single pan. There are three possible 
vertical positioning of the pans (i) Left pan is low and right pan is 
high (ii) Both pan is in the middle (iii) Left pan is high and right 
pan is low. If weight of both pan is same then they should be in state 
(ii), if the left pan is heavier then they should be in status (i) and 
so on. In the input the pans are always in position (i), (ii) or (iii) 
but that may not be the correct position according to the weights they 
contain.

<P>You live in the universe X where all the physical laws and constants are different from ours. For example all of their objects are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>-dimensional.

<P>Knockout tournaments are sometimes heart breaking for players but still they are very much common in real world because the audience love them so much. Some tournaments have round robin format initially and then they turn into knockout tournaments in latter rounds (Like FIFA Soccer World Cup). On the other hand most lawn tennis tournaments are knockout tournaments from the very first round. Such a knockout tournament with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> rounds has <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<SUP>n</SUP></SPAN> teams.

He keeps track of how many matches he has won and how many matches he has lost and at the end of 10, 20 or 30 years he starts to calculate his performance. But the problem is that he cannot keep track of what round he has reached in which tournament and also in how many tournaments he has participated in because he plays thousands of computer-generated matches per day.

<P>In a water refining plant, the flow of impure water is passed through a network consisting of straight-line water pipes. There are several pipes in the network. Each of them performs a particular operation in the refinement process. So, the impure water must pass through each of them. These pipes are placed on a 2D grid like surface and the two endpoints of each pipe can be described by a pair of integer coordinates. Every two pipes sharing an endpoint are joined at that location through a multi-way connector. Each connector has one or two pairs of openings. All the openings are connected to some pipe. In addition to the openings for joining pipes, each connector can be connected to a water tank. So, in a single refinement process, the tank full of impure water is connected to one of the connectors, all of the water is passed through the pipe networks as necessary and then purified water is brought back to the tank. It might be important to clarify that there is only one tank in the system and there is no additional pipe to send fresh water back to the tank once the purification is done. Also, in order to prevent overuse of the pipes, in a single refinement process water is allowed to pass through any pipe exactly once. This single flow through a pipe can be in any direction.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="375" HEIGHT="202" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/48/p4861.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4861.eps}"></DIV><P>Now, waters can move freely through the pipes but if they need to change direction in the connectors, external energy must be supplied by using pumps. The amount of rotation can be expressed as a function of the pump's energy. For a network, TRA (Total Rotation Amount) can be calculated in the following way. After the flow is complete, a polygon is created by tracing the path of water flow inside the network. Then at each node of the polygon, we take the smallest angle between the two lines adjacent to it. By summing up these angle values for all the nodes, we get the TRA. A pump with e units of energy can provide <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Ae</I><SUP>3</SUP> + <I>Be</I><SUP>2</SUP> + <I>Ce</I> + <I>D</I></SPAN> full circle amount of TRA where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I></SPAN> are non-negative integer constants.<P>You are given the description of a network and the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>e</I></SPAN> values of a pump.

`Hyper Knights' is a puzzle game played in a 2D board. Though the game 
may not be too familiar to you, but in `KnightsLand' it's a very popular 
game. The best thing of the game is that many people can play the game 
together competing others. The rules of the games are as follows: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Initially an <!-- MATH
 $m \times n$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>n</I></SPAN> white board is taken and in each cell an 
integer is written. After that some cells are colored green and some 
cells are colored red. All the players are sent one copy of the board. 
Then each of the players starts placing Hyper Knights (like chess 
knights) in the board for one hour. No player can see others board.

<P>
When placing Hyper Knights, each player can use as many Hyper Knights 
as they want, but the jury accepts a board if the following constraints 
are fulfilled. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<OL>
<LI>In each cell, at most one Hyper Knight can be placed. 
</LI>
<LI>A Hyper Knight should be placed in each green cell. 
</LI>
<LI>No Hyper Knight should be placed in the red cells. 
</LI>
<LI>No two Hyper Knights in the board should be in attacking 
positions. 
</LI>
<LI>A board with no Hyper Knights is rejected. 
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Two Hyper Knights are said to be in attacking positions if 

<P>

<OL>
<LI>their vertical distance is 3 and horizontal distance is 1 or, 
</LI>
<LI>their vertical distance is 1 and horizontal distance is 3 
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The scoring technique is quite simple. For a player's accepted board, 
if a cell contains a Hyper Knight, then the player is awarded a score 
same as the integer written in that cell. And for all his placed Hyper 
Knights, he sums up his scores. The player whose overall score is 
highest wins the game. If several players tie; all of them are declared 
as the winners. Now, you are given a `Hyper Knights' board as described, 
you have to find the maximum score a player can get in that board 
maintaining all the restrictions.

<P>
For each case, print a line containing the case number and the maximum 
score a player can make. After that you have to print the 
lexicographically smallest Hyper Knight placement that forms the 
maximum score. Print the row and column position of each Hyper Knight 
in separate lines. See the samples for details. 

<P>
To check the lexicographical order we first make a list using each Hyper 
Knight placement as <!-- MATH
 $[a_{1}, b_{1}, a_{2}, b_{2} \ldots a_{x}, b_{x}]$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">[<I>a</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>b</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>a</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>b</I><SUB>2</SUB>...<I>a</I><SUB>x</SUB>, <I>b</I><SUB>x</SUB>]</SPAN>, 
where cell <!-- MATH
 $(a_{i}, b_{i})$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>a</I><SUB>i</SUB>, <I>b</I><SUB>i</SUB>)</SPAN> contains a Hyper Knight. After that we 
find the lexicographical order using these lists. For example, 
<!-- MATH
 $[1, 2, 21, 5]$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">[1, 2, 21, 5]</SPAN> is smaller than <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[1, 11]</SPAN> and <!-- MATH
 $[1, 1, 12, 13]$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">[1, 1, 12, 13]</SPAN> is 
smaller than <!-- MATH
 $[1, 1, 12, 13, 1, 3]$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">[1, 1, 12, 13, 1, 3]</SPAN>.

Luckily, the statistics he collected are all intact.<P>Not wanting to miss this opportunity for a promotion, he is wondering whether he can recover his lost data using the statistical information he collected.

<P>
While driving the other day, John looked down at his odometer, and it 
read 100000. John was pretty excited about that. But, just one mile 
further, the odometer read 100001, and John was REALLY excited! You 
see, John loves palindromes - things that read the same way forwards 
and backwards. So, given any odometer reading, what is the least 
number of miles John must drive before the odometer reading is a 
palindrome? For John, every odometer digit counts. If the odometer 
reading was 000121, he wouldn't consider that a palindrome.

There will be several test cases in the input. Each test case will 
consist of an odometer reading on its own line. Each odometer reading

number of digits given in the input so, if the input is 00456, the 
odometer has 5 digits. There will be no spaces in the input, and no 
blank lines between input sets. The input will end with a line with

Your friends have just opened a new business, and you want to see how 
well they are doing. The business has been running for a number of 
days, and your friends have recorded their net profit on each day. 
You want to find the largest total profit that your friends have made 
during any consecutive time span of at least one day. For example, if 
your friends' profits looked like this: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Day 1: -3 

<P>
Day 2: 4

Day 3: 9 

<P>
Day 4: -2 

<P>
Day 5: -5 

<P>
Day 6: 8 

<P>

<P>

Penney's game is a simple game typically played by two players. One 
version of the game calls for each player to choose a unique 
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">three-coin</SPAN> sequence such as <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">HEADS TAILS HEADS (HTH)</SPAN>. 
A fair coin is tossed sequentially some number of times until one of 
the two sequences appears. The player who chose the first sequence to 
appear wins the game. 

<P>
For this problem, you will write a program that implements a variation 
on the <SPAN  CLASS="textit"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Penney Game</SPAN></SPAN>. You will read a sequence of 40 
coin tosses and determine how many times each <SPAN  CLASS="textit">three</SPAN>-coin sequence 
appears. Obviously there are eight such three-coin sequences: <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">TTT</SPAN>, 
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">TTH</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">THT</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">THH</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">HTT</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">HTH</SPAN>, 
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">HHT</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">HHH</SPAN>. Sequences may overlap. For example, 
if all 40 coin tosses are heads, then the sequence <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">HHH</SPAN> appears 38 
times.

The strategy for normal form Nim is to compute the Nim-2 sum <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> of the 
sizes of all piles. If at any time, you end your turn with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I> = 0</SPAN>, you 
are guaranteed a <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">WIN</SPAN>. Any opponent move must leave <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> not 0 
and there is always a move to get <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> back to 0. This is done by 
computing <!-- MATH
 $NimSum(2, T, PS)$

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>NimSum</I>(2, <I>T</I>, <I>PS</I>)</SPAN> for each pile; if this is less than the pile size

<P>Fax machines use a form of compression based on <SPAN CLASS="textit">run-length encoding</SPAN>. Run-length encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of data compression in which <SPAN CLASS="textit">runs</SPAN> of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. This is most useful on data that contains many such runs: for example, relatively simple graphic images such as icons, text, and line drawings. It is not useful with files that don't have many runs as it could potentially double the file size (photograph, for example).<P>For this problem, you will write a program that encodes a block of data using a very simple RLE algorithm. A <SPAN CLASS="textit">run</SPAN> is encoded using a two byte sequence. The first byte of the sequence contains the <SPAN CLASS="textit">count</SPAN>, and the second contains the <SPAN CLASS="textit">value</SPAN> to repeat. The <SPAN CLASS="textit">count</SPAN> is encoded using an 8 bit value with the high order bit set to 1. The remaining 7 bits represent the <SPAN CLASS="textit">count</SPAN>-3. This gives a maximum run count of 130 per 2 byte sequence. (This implies that the minimum run count is 3). Bytes that are not part of a <SPAN CLASS="textit">run</SPAN> are encoded as-is with a prefix byte indicating the count of bytes in the <SPAN CLASS="textit">non-run</SPAN> minus 1, 0 through 127, representing a range of 1 - 128 (the high order bit will always be 0 in the case of <SPAN CLASS="textit">non-run</SPAN> data).<P>If a run contains more than 130 bytes, then it must be encoded using multiple sequences, the first of which will always be a run of 130. All <SPAN CLASS="textit">runs</SPAN> of 3 or more <SPAN CLASS="textbf">must</SPAN> be encoded as a <SPAN CLASS="textit">run</SPAN>. If a <SPAN CLASS="textit">non-run</SPAN> contains more than 128 bytes, then multiple non-run sequences must be used. For example, a run of 262 would be encoded as two runs of 130 followed by a non-run of 2.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The first line of input contains a single integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(1<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/48/4875img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>P</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/48/4875img1.png ALT="$ \le$">1000)</SPAN>, which is the number of data sets that follow.

<P>In Olden Days, before digital typesetting (before Babbage, even), typesetting was an art, practiced by highly skilled craftsmen. Certain character combinations, such as a-e or f-i were typeset as a single character, called a <SPAN CLASS="textit">ligature</SPAN>, to save space and to make the characters look better together on the printed page (the ligatures for a-e and f-i were `a e' and `f i', respectively; the table on the next page, lists all possible ligature combinations).<P>In addition, there were two different versions of the lowercase letter s: the ``long s" (&#223;) and the ``short s". Only the short s is used today. The rules for when to use which version are odd, but straightforward:<P><P><BR><OL><LI>Short s is used at the end of a word, or before punctuation within a word, such as a hyphen or apostrophe: <SPAN CLASS="textit">programs</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="textit">success</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="textit">hocus-pocus</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="textit">revis'd</SPAN>. (programs, &#223;ucce&#223;s, hocus-pocus, revis'd) </LI><LI>Short s is used before the letters `f', `b', or `k': <SPAN CLASS="textit">transfer</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="textit">husband</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="textit">ask</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="textit">successful</SPAN>. (transfer, husband, ask, &#223;ucce&#223;sful) </LI><LI>Long s is used everywhere else, <SPAN CLASS="textit">except</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN> </LI><LI>It is possible that a compound word consists of a word ending in a double s followed by a word beginning with s (this is the only situation where the sequence ``<TT>sss</TT>" occurs in English text). In this case, the middle s is set short and the other two are set long: <SPAN CLASS="textit">crossstitch</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="textit">crossstaff</SPAN>. (cro&#223;s&#223;titch, cro&#223;s&#223;af f) </LI></OL><P><P><BR>Note that a ``word" is not the same thing as an ``identifier." While identifiers can contain punctuation marks such as `_' or `$', words can contain only letters (at least as far as typographers are concerned). Therefore, identifiers like ``<TT>radius3</TT>" and `` <TT>adios_amigo</TT>" would be typeset as ``radius3" and ``adios_amigo," respectively, rather than ``radiu&#223;3" and ``adio&#223;_amigo."<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The first line of input contains a single integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(1<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/48/4879img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>P</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/48/4879img1.png ALT="$ \le$">1000)</SPAN>, which is the number of data sets that follow.

When writing automatically generated expressions that a human may have to read, it is useful to minimize the number of parentheses in an expression. We assume expressions consist of only two operations: addition (+) and multiplication (juxtaposition), and these operations act on single lower-case letter variables only. Specifically, here is the grammar for an expression <tt>E</tt>:</p><pre>
E : P | P '+' E

F : V | '(' E ')'
V : 'a' | 'b' | .. | 'z'
</pre><p>The addition (<tt>+</tt>, as in <tt>x+y</tt>) and multiplication (juxtaposition, as in <tt>xy</tt>) operators are associative: <tt>x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z=x+y+z</tt> and <tt>x(yz)=(xy)z=xyz</tt>. Commutativity and distributivity of these operations should not be assumed. Parentheses have the highest precedence, followed by multiplication and then addition.</p><h1>Input</h1><p>The input consists of a number of cases.

Each set of connected black pixels can be completely described by listing the positions of the pixels on its boundary in counterclockwise order, starting at some arbitrary point on the boundary. This list of pixels can, in turn, be represented simply as the direction to the next one in the list. This list of directions is called the chain code of the object, and describes the shape of the object precisely while being position independent.</p><p>There are 8 possible directions from one pixel to an adjacent pixel, and while assigning these numbers is arbitrary, <b>figure&nbsp;1</b> shows the standard convention. The direction 0 means "to the right of", 2 "means immediately above", and 1 is at 45 degrees, bisecting 0 and 2, and so on.</p><p>Two black pixels are considered to be adjacent if the square of the distance between them is less than or equal to 2. This is based on a standard graphics coordinate system having a pixel at each integer coordinate. Two pixels are connected if a contiguous path of adjacent pixels can be traced between them. A connected region is a set of black pixels in which all members are connected to each other. A boundary pixel of a connected region (from now on just a region) is a pixel within the region that has at least one neighbor (in the four compass directions) that is not black. For this problem, you may assume that there are no Ã¢Â€ÂœholesÃ¢Â€Â� in the region, so that there is only one boundary of the region.</p><p>The chain code of a region can start at any pixel on the boundary. It proceeds by finding the next adjacent pixel on the boundary in a counter-clockwise direction, saving the direction (0-7) in an output buffer, and then continuing the process from the new pixel. When we arrive at the starting pixel again, the chain code is complete. The output buffer contains a set of direction values which comprise the chain code itself, and from which the original set of pixels can be recreated starting at any pixel position in an image.</p><p>As an example, a chain code for the region in <b>figure&nbsp;2</b> is <tt>446567001232</tt>. The chain code describes the shape of the region unambiguously, although its position is completely unknown.

For each task, if we are given a list of other tasks that it depends on, then it is relatively straightforward to come up with a schedule of tasks that satisfies the dependencies and produces a stunning dish. Many of us know that this can be solved by some algorithm called toplogical sort.</p><p>But life is not so easy sometimes. For example, here is a recipe for making pizza dough:</p><ol><li>Mix the yeast with warm water, wait for 5 to 10 minutes.</li> <li>Mix the the remaining ingredients 7 to 9 minutes.</li> <li>Mix the yeast and the remaining ingredients together for 10 to 15 minutes.</li> <li>Wait 90 to 120 minutes for the dough to rise.</li> <li>Punch the dough and let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li> <li>Roll the dough.</li></ol><p>In this case, tasks 1 and 2 may be scheduled after the first minute (we always spend the first minute to read the recipe and come up with a plan). The earliest task 3 may be started is at 8 minutes, and task 4 may start at 18 minutes after the start, and so on. This recipe is relatively simple, but if some tasks have many dependent tasks then scheduling can become unmanageable. Sometimes, the recipe may in fact be impossible to execute. For example, consider the following abstract recipe:</p><ol><li>task 1</li> <li>after task 1 but within 2 minutes of it, do task 2</li> <li>at least 3 minutes after task 2 but within 2 minutes of task 1, do task 3</li></ol><p>In this problem, you are given a number of tasks.

For any given team, we wish to know what is the highest and lowest rank it can have at the end of the season.</p><p>For each game played, a team wins if it scores more goals than its opponent. A team loses a game if it scores fewer goals. When both teams score the same number of goals, we call it a draw. A team earns 3 points for each win, 1 point for each draw and 0 point for each loss. Teams are ranked according to the number of points earned (more points result in a higher ranking). Teams that are tied are given the same rank. For example, if two teams are tied and have the next highest point total after the 3rd place team, then they are both ranked 4th (and the next team is ranked 6th). In real life, factors such as goal differences and goals scored are used to break ties, but we will not consider these for this problem.</p><p>You are given a list of soccer teams and a list of matches in a season. You may assume that every team will play the same number of games at the end. Some of the matches have been played and the results are known.</p><h1>Input</h1><p>The input consists of a number of cases. The first line in each case specifies two integers <tt>n</tt> and <tt>m</tt> (<tt>2 &le; n &le; 20</tt>, <tt>1 &le; m &le; 1000</tt>) indicating the number of teams in the league and the number of matches in the season. The next <tt>n</tt> lines contain the name of each team in its own line. The team names contain only alphabetic characters and have lengths at most 30 characters. This is followed by <tt>m</tt> lines each of the form</p><blockquote><tt>team1 vs team2: x y </tt></blockquote><p>with <tt>team1</tt> and <tt>team2</tt> being the names of two different teams, and <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are non-negative integers (or both are -1), indicating that in the game between <tt>team1</tt> and <tt>team2</tt>, <tt>team1</tt> scores <tt>x</tt> goals and <tt>team2</tt> scores <tt>y</tt> goals. If both <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are -1, then the game has not yet been played. At most 12 games will not have been played yet.</p><p>The input is terminated with <tt>n = m = 0</tt>.</p><h1>Output</h1><p>For each team in the same order as the team list in the input, print one line of the following form:</p><blockquote><tt>Team XXX can finish as high as nth place and as low as mth place. </tt></blockquote><p>Use <tt>st</tt>, <tt>nd</tt>, and <tt>rd</tt> instead of <tt>th</tt> for first, second, and third place, respectively.

right intersection, always moving away from her starting point and 
closer to the destination.

<P>
A certain game involves rolling five dice and scoring according to a 
score sheet. At each turn, the player rolls all five dice. Next, the 
player considers the roll and potentially removes and re-rolls some 
or all of the dice with the intention of potentially improving the 
score. This happens again, and after two re-rolls the final dice are 
used for scoring. 

<P>
The score sheet is divided into two halves, the top half and (wait for 
it!) the bottom half. The bottom half is organized like various poker 
hands, such as three-of-a-kind and a full-house. The problem here only 
concerns the top half of the score sheet. 

<P>
In the top half of the sheet, the player takes the final roll and adds 
up the dice according to whether they want ``ones", ``twos", and so on. 
In other words, if the five dice show 3-4-3-5-2, the player could opt 
to fill in the ``threes" slot, and then adds the two occurrences of 
threes that are showing, for a total score of six. As another example, 
if a player were to roll 2-2-3-2-6, the score could be recorded as six 
in the twos slot. The player must fill in each of the slots: ones, 
twos, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN> up to the sixes slot. When all of the slots are filled, 
the total for the upper half is the sum of the scores in each slot. If 
a player scores a total of at least 63 points in the upper half, a 
bonus of 35 points is added to the upper section score. This 63 points 
corresponds to three-of-a-kind for each of the six dice faces. A 
common way to get the bonus is rolling four or five of a larger 
number so that fewer of the smaller numbers are needed (a player 
can earn the bonus even if he or she scores a "0" in an upper section 
slot). 

<P>
Since there are six upper half slots to fill, it will require six rolls 
of the dice. When actually playing the game, one of the variables is 
when to fill in each slot, and once an entry is placed on the score 
sheet it remains for the remainder of the game. So a player rolling 
6-6-3-6-2 should probably score this as an 18 in the six slot, not a 
three in the three slot or a two in the two slot. In our case we have 
advance knowledge of all dice rolls, so we can use this to maximize 
the potential score and place the rolls of the dice into the correct 
slots.

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Example</SPAN>

<P>
Consider these dice rolls: 
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
2-3-2-6-1      1-3-1-1-1      4-3-4-6-4      2-3-5-5-6   
   6-3-5-3-5      1-4-4-6-1 

</DIV>

<P>
There are a number of ways that these rolls can be used to fill the 
slots on the upper half of the score sheet. Here are two of them:

 ALT="\epsfbox{p4893.eps}">
</DIV>

<P>
Obviously there are other potential orderings and totals, and that at 
least based on the above, a score of 42 is better than a score of 25. 
Remember that if the sub-total is at least 63, then there is a 35 point 
bonus, although this does not occur in this example.

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<P>
Write a program to accept one or more sets of six rolls of five dice, and 
to display the maximum number of points that can be scored given the 
above rules and the given set of dice rolls. All that is necessary is 
to display this maximum score; it is not necessary to explain the 
placing of the rolls into the slots.

<P>Trees, particularly binary trees, are a common data structure, and describing them is a common task. One notation for describing a binary tree uses a triple (level, position, label) for each node. Level gives the depth of a node in the tree, with the root node at level 1, its children at level 2, and so forth. Position gives the position of the node among the nodes at the same depth, with the leftmost node at a given depth having position 1, the next node having position 2, and so forth. Label is the text to be used in labeling the node.<P>For example, the binary tree defined by the set of six input triples shown on the left would normally be illustrated as shown on the right.<P><P><BR><IMG WIDTH="310" HEIGHT="98" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/48/4894img1.png ALT="$\textstyle \parbox{.55\textwidth}{

<P>
Folks sometimes get upset with Bill because he always obeys the 
speed limits when driving. He believes many drivers and even some 
law-enforcement officers are of the opinion that driving a few 
miles or kilometers per hour over the posted speed limit is okay. 

<P>
To convince others that his behavior is reasonable, Bill wants to 
show others how small a benefit is obtained from this ``gray-zone" 
speeding. The benefit most would attribute to speeding is getting 
to the destination more quickly. In this problem we're going to 
give Bill some information to support his argument. 

<P>
Assume a driver travels on a straight road with a single traffic 
signal that cycles between green, yellow, and red (as usual). Given 
the position of the traffic signal on the road, the speed limit, 
and the time the signal is green, yellow, and red, we want to know 
the average decrease in time required to drive this segment of road 
if the driver speeds by a given amount. To make things simple, we'll 
assume the driver only stops for the red signal, and proceeds past 
the light if it is green or yellow. And the vehicle being driven is 
phenomenal! It can stop instantaneously, and can also instantaneously 
go from a stop to any arbitrary speed! 

<P>
For example, consider a one kilometer road that effectively has no 
traffic signal (that is, assume the length of time the signal stays 
red is 0). If the speed limit is 60 kilometers per hour, then driving 
this road at the speed limit will require 1/60th of an hour, or 60 
seconds. If the driver speeds through at 65 kilometers per hour, then 
it will take 1/65th of an hour, or about 55.4 seconds. So the driver 
saves an entire 4.6 seconds by speeding.

There will be multiple input cases to consider. The input for each case 
is a line containing 7 integers giving the length of the road, the

length of time the signal is green, yellow, and red (in that order, 
each given in seconds), the speed limit, and the amount over the speed 
limit the driver drives. Distances are in kilometers, and speeds are in 
kilometers per hour. The line following the input for last case will 
contain 7 zeroes.

With inexpensive scanners and computing systems, optical character 
recognition, or OCR, is now frequently used and very reliable. Most 
OCR systems perform some recognition tasks by matching the outline of 
a scanned character against the outline of known samples. Unfortunately, 
spots on a scanned image have a significant negative impact on this 
matching process. In this problem you'll consider how to ``despeckle" 
the image of a character to remove these extraneous spots. 

<P>
The image of a scanned character will be provided as a rectangular 
bitmap indicating the light and dark pixels, or picture elements, 
comprising the image. The dark pixels represent regions containing 
ink (or extraneous marks), and the light pixels represent the unmarked 
background on which the character was placed. For this problem, 0 and 
1 represent light and dark regions, respectively. For example, on the 
left below is a bitmap with 13 rows and 15 columns representing the 
capital letter A with two extraneous pixels (speckles, or bad spots) 
that we wish to remove. If we number the rows 0 to 12 from the top to 
the bottom, and the columns 0 to 14 from the left to the right, then 
the extraneous pixels are at row 1, column 2 and row 11, column 14.

 ALT="\epsfbox{p4896.eps}">
</DIV>

<P>
To identify the unwanted pixels, first determine the area of the 
smallest convex polygon that encloses all the dark pixels, treating 
each dark pixel as a point. This polygon can be visualized as that 
resulting from stretching a rubber band around the set of dark pixels 
in the bitmap. This is illustrated by the dotted lines superimposed 
on the bitmap shown on the right above. 

<P>
Next determine if removing any of the dark pixels will reduce the area 
of the convex polygon by at least a specified percentage. If it does, 
assume that pixel was an unwanted ``speckle", remove it from the 
bitmap (that is, set it to 0), and repeat the steps until there are 
no pixels that can be removed to reduce the area by at least the 
specified percentage. If there are multiple pixels that could be 
removed to suitably reduce the area, select the pixel that reduces 
the area by the largest percentage. Resolve any remaining tie by first 
removing the pixel with the smallest row number, and then the pixel 
with the smallest column number, assuming pixels are numbered as 
described above.

Everybody now sends SMS (``text") messages from phone to phone. On many 
phones, the procedure for sending a message is to press the numeric 
key associated with the desired letter as many times as necessary in 
order to select that letter. For example, to create the letter ``N", 
one would press the ``6" twice - the first selects ``M" and the second 
press changes the ``M" into an ``N". A space between words is created 
by pressing the ``#" once. 

<P>
This procedure is sufficient for a word like ``BET" where one can first 
press ``2" twice, then ``3" twice, then ``8". A complicating factor is 
when the adjacent letters use the same number, as in ``CAB". It is 
necessary to press ``2" three times for the ``C", then wait a certain 
time, then press ``2" once for the ``A", wait a certain time, then 
press ``2" twice for the ``B". Let's refer to this waiting as a 
``pause" in the buttons, and the notation ``222P-2P-22" stands 
for the word ``CAB". There is a dash between the keys necessary 
for each letter, and there is a ``P" to indicate the necessary pause.

Professor Moriarty has devised what he believes is a fiendishly clever 
code to communicate with his cohorts. At the first level, messages 
using this code are a sequence of numbers, each of which consists of 
between 2 and 9 digits (each digit in the range 1 through 9) in ascending 
and consecutive order (like 2345, or 789). To make things worse, at the 
second level of encoding he replaces each digit with a capital letter, 
and these letter sequences are then transmitted as the encoded message. 

<P>
Luckily, some of the cohorts discarded a slip of paper containing a clue 
that enables you to decode the numeric sequences into the original 
messages. But you must still find some way of translating those letter 
sequences in the corresponding sequences of numbers. Sherlock has asked 
you to help. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
As an example of what's needed, consider the message containing these 
8 letter-sequences:

<P>
<PRE>
RE   EW   OIU   IUYTR   YTR   TRE   EW   POIU
</PRE> 

<P>
After manipulating these for a while, Sherlock found they match the 
digits 1 through 9 as shown in the following table. But it takes too 
long to do messages by hand, so a program to do the job is required.

<P>Television's <SPAN CLASS="textit">Toddler Time's</SPAN> topic taught to toddler Tommy Tiwilliger today was triangles (and the letter T)! Tommy became so enamored by triangles that immediately after the show ended, he grabbed his safety scissors and the nearest sheets of paper he could find and started cutting out his own triangles. After about 15 minutes each paper had one triangular shaped hole cut out of it. But Tommy wasn't finished yet. He noticed he could divide each of the original triangles into two triangles with a single cut starting from one corner. He spent another 15 minutes doing just that. Things would have gone along swimmingly, except that Tommy's mother eventually came into the room and noticed that the original sheets of paper were part of a very important document for a legal case she was working on (involving a lover's triangle). After carefully removing Tommy from the room and counting slowly to 10 (a triangular number), she went about trying to reconstruct the pages after gathering together the now randomly scattered triangles. Your job is to help her by writing a little program to determine which triangles go where (and try to get it done before tomorrow's episode of <SPAN CLASS="textit">Toddler Time</SPAN> on papier- m&#226;ch&#232;).<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Each test case will start with an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/4900img1.png ALT="$ \le$">20</SPAN> indicating the number of holes cut out, followed by the coordinates of the holes, one hole per line.

<P>We are all familiar with conventional mazes laid out on a 2-D grid. A 3-D maze can be constructed as follows: Consider a hollowed out cube aligned along the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I></SPAN> axes with one corner at (0,0,0) and the opposite corner at <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>n</I> - 1, <I>n</I> - 1, <I>n</I> - 1)</SPAN>. On each face of the cube is a 2-D maze made by removing a subset of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1 <TT>x</TT> 1 <TT>x</TT> 1</SPAN> cubes from the face (no edge cubes are removed). The object of the maze is to move a marker located inside the cube from an initial location of (1,1,1) to the final destination of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>n</I> - 2, <I>n</I> - 2, <I>n</I> - 2)</SPAN>. However, attached to this marker are 6 rods, each protruding through one face of the cube. The movement of these rods is constrained by the 2-D mazes on the faces. The picture below gives an example of a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">7 <TT>x</TT> 7 <TT>x</TT> 7</SPAN> maze. Note that this maze is not physically realizable since some faces (e.g., the front face containing the letter ``<TT>A</TT>") have cubes that are disconnected from the edges of the face. Such mazes are allowed in this problem.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="564" HEIGHT="446" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4902a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4902a.eps}"></DIV><P>The black regions indicate open spaces where the rods can move. The figure to the right specifies the possible directions that the rods can move (Forward, Back, Left, Right, Up, Down) and also defines the labels for the six sides of the cube. In the maze above, the rods are shown in their initial position centered at (1,1,1). From here they can not move Forward, Backward, Right, Left or Down, but they can move Up (assuming there are open spaces for the two back rods to move to).<P>To specify a cube, a description of each face must be given.

The big media gimmick these days seems to be vampires. Vampire movies, 
vampire television shows, vampire books, vampire dolls, vampire 
cereal, vampire lipstick, vampire bunnies - kids and teenagers 
and even some adults spend lots of time and money on vampire-related 
stuff. Surprisingly, nowadays vampires are often the good guys. 
Obviously, the ACM Programming Contest had better have a vampire 
problem in order to be considered culturally relevant. 

<P>
As eveyone knows, vampires are allergic to garlic, sunlight, crosses, 
wooden stakes, and the Internal Revenue Service. But curiously they 
spend a good part of their time smashing mirrors. Why? Well, mirrors 
can't hurt vampires physically, but it's embarrassing to be unable 
to cast a reflection. Mirrors hurt vampire's feelings. This problem 
is about trying to help them avoid mirrors. 

<P>
In a room full of vampires and ordinary mortals there are a number of 
mirrors. Each mirror has one of four orientations - north, south, east, 
or west (the orientation indicates which side of the mirror reflects). 
A vampire is in danger of embarrassment if he or she is in a direct 
horizontal or vertical line with the reflecting side of a mirror, 
unless there are intervening objects (mortals or other mirrors). 
For example, in the following room layout

the start and end squares of the mirror (same bounds as above). Mirrors 
can be of any positive length, have a thickness of 1 grid square, and

Kazimir, the robot, has a new job tidying stacks of CDs. Several 
stacks of CDs are placed evenly near the perimeter on top of a round 
table. The stacks contain different numbers of CDs and they are about 
to be put away to storage. Kazimir's pointy-haired boss is fickle: each 
stack must contain the same number of CDs.

<P>
Kazimir has to rebalance the stacks. But, as befits a robot, Kazimir can 
only move CDs between neighboring stacks. Thus, Kazimir is allowed to 
take any number of CDs from any stack and move these CDs to one of 
the two immediately adjacent stacks (we refer to this process as one 
move). 

<P>
Help Kazimir rebalance the stacks so that each stack ends up 
with the same number of CDs. Of course, Kazimir is a lazy robot and 
seeks a solution with the fewest possible moves.

Competition has been fierce among the cellphone providers in the town of Eastern WestField.
Several companies have been running ads in which they each claim to provide more coverage to
the town than do any of their competitors.

<P>
AetherTech Telecommunications suspects that they, in fact, really do cover a larger portion of
the town than do their competitors. They would like to compute their actual coverage so thay they
can advertise the true amount.

<P>
The metropolitan area of EasternWestField will be modeled as a circle around the town center.
The area covered by each cell tower can also be modeled as a circle, centered on the location of the
tower, indicating the area within which a the tower provides sufficient signal strength for a phone
to connect (e.g., one bar on the average phoneÂ’s signal strength meter).

<P>
All cell towers to be considered will have their centers within the metropolitan area, though
their area of coverage may extend beyond the border of the metropolitan area. The areas covered
by different towers can overlap, though for economic reasons no two towers have been constructed
so close to one another that the center of one would lie within the coverage area of the other.

<P>
Compute the fraction of the metropolitan area within which a cell phone would be covered by
at least one tower.

When writing articles, there is usually an abstract section which summarizes the entire article.
We are experimenting with an automatic abstract generation algorithm. The algorithm reads in
an article and prepares an abstract that summarizes the entire article. The abstract is formed by
combining the Â“topic sentencesÂ” extracted from consecutive paragraphs.

<p>
For the purposes of this problem,
<ul><li>An article consists of one or more paragraphs.
<li>A paragraph is a maximal sequence of non-empty lines.
<li>A sentence is a maximal sequence of characters within a paragraph that begins with a non-
whitespace character, that ends with a Â‘.Â’ (period), Â‘?Â’, or Â‘!Â’, and that does not contain any
other occurrences of Â‘.Â’, Â‘?Â’, or Â‘!Â’.
<li>A word is a maximal sequence of alphabetic characters within a sentence.
</ul>
<p>
The term maximal in the definitions above is intended to convey the idea that we are only
interested in the longest sequences that match the definition, not in any of their subsequences.
For example, the sentence Â“How now, brown cow?Â” contains four words. Â“nowÂ” is a word in this
sentence, but Â“noÂ”, Â“owÂ”, etc., are not words because they are not maximal Â– they are subsequences
of a larger sequence of alphabetic characters.

<p>
A topic sentence for a paragraph is the single sentence in the paragraph that best describes the
paragraphÂ’s content. For our purposes, we will select the earliest sentence in the paragraph that
maximizes the number of distinct words in S that also occur in any following sentence within the
same paragraph.

<p>
Paragraphs with fewer than three sentences are ignored and will not contribute to the abstract.

<p>
When comparing words for distinctness, changes in upper/lower case are ignored. For example,
the sentence Â“See what I see.Â” contains three distinct words, not four.

non-empty lines, and is terminated by an empty line or by the Â“***Â” or Â“******Â” markers

***
From: The Wright BrothersÂ’ Aeroplane.

By Orville and Wilbur Wright

In the field of aviation there were two schools. The first,
represented by such men as Professor Langley and Sir Hiram Maxim,
gave chief attention to power flight; the second, represented by
Lilienthal, Mouillard, and Chanute, to soaring flight. Our sympathies
were with the latter school, partly from impatience at the wasteful
extravagance of mounting delicate and costly machinery on wings
which no one knew how to manage, and partly, no doubt, from the
extraordinary charm and enthusiasm with which the apostles of soaring
flight set forth the beauties of sailing through the air on fixed
wings, deriving the motive power from the wind itself.

We began our active experiments at the close of this period, in October,
1900, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Our machine was designed to be
flown as a kite, with a man on board, in winds from 15 to 20 miles an
hour. But, upon trial, it was found that much stronger winds were
required to lift it. Suitable winds not being plentiful, we found it
necessary, in order to test the new balancing system, to fly the machine
as a kite without a man on board, operating the levers through cords
from the ground. This did not give the practice anticipated, but it
inspired confidence in the new system of balance.

In the summer of 1901 we became personally acquainted with Mr. Chanute.
When he learned that we were interested in flying as a sport, and not
with any expectation of recovering the money we were expending on it, he
gave us much encouragement. At our invitation, he spent several weeks
with us at our camp at Kill Devil Hill, four miles south of Kitty Hawk,
during our experiments of that and the two succeeding years. He also
witnessed one flight of the power machine near Dayton, Ohio, in October,
1904.

An overhead camera has snapped a photo of the papers on a bureaucratÂ’s desk. Many of the
papers overlap, but, because the bureaucrat in questions is a bit of a neatness freak, all papers
are aligned with their edges parallel to the edges of the desk. As a preliminary step in analyzing
these papers, other programs have used cues of paper color, edges, etc., to label each pixel in the
image according to which sheet of paper is visible in that particular location. The result will look
something like this:

<p>Assume that each paper is rectangular, and that no important information is being lost Â“be-

If you are able to submit a solution at 12:39, the wise judges would determine that 9 minutes had elapsed since the start of the contest. Sadly, as the day grows longer, the judges have more trouble doing the calculations accurately (how quickly can you determine the elapsed time for a 3:21 submission?)</p><p>Having struggled for many years, the judges developed the following system. Before the contest starts, they place the following table on the board at the front of the room</p><center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4919.png></center>When a problem is submitted with a given time-stamp, they determine which row of the table to use, based upon the hour of the time-stamp. Then, the formula in the right column is used to compute the number of elapsed minutes. For example, with a submission time of 12:39, the top row is applied with XX=39, leading to the elapsed minutes calculated as <nobr>39 - 30 = 9</nobr>. For a program submitted at 3:21, the fourth row is used to calculate <nobr>21 + 150 = 171</nobr> elapsed minutes.<p></p><p>Your goal is to develop a program that generates the appropriate table given knowledge of the starting time and duration of a contest.</p><p><b>Input:</b> The input starts with a line containing a single integer <nobr>1 &#8804; N &#8804; 30</nobr> that is the number of cases.

The values <nobr>1 &#8804; SH &#8804; 12</nobr> and <nobr>0 &#8804; SM &#8804; 59</nobr> respectively represent the hour and minute at which a contest starts. The values <nobr>0 &#8804; DH &#8804; 10</nobr> and <nobr>0 &#8804; DM &#8804; 59</nobr> represent the duration of the contest in terms of hours and minutes. A contest will last at least 1&nbsp;minute and at most 10&nbsp;hours and 59&nbsp;minutes. This allows us to omit any A.M. or P.M. designations for the times.</p><p><b>Output:</b> For each case, you are to produce a table formatted as shown in the Example Output. Any row in which the hour designator is a single digit (e.g., 5:XX) should have a single leading space, as should the header of the table just before the word "time".</p><p>The table must have a row for every hour block in which a program might be submitted. Assume that the earliest possible submission is precisely the contest starting time (i.e., 0&nbsp;elapsed minutes), and that the latest possible submission has an elapsed time of the full duration of the contest (e.g., 5:30 in our region).</p><p></p><br><br><table border="1" cellpadding="10"><thead><tr><td><b>Example Input:</b></td><td><b>Example Output:</b></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="font-family: monospace;" valign="top">3<br>12 30 5 0<br>7 0 2 59<br>9 59 4 1</td><td style="font-family: monospace;" valign="top">------+---------<br>&nbsp;time | elapsed<br>------+---------<br>12:XX | XX - 30<br>&nbsp;1:XX | XX + 30<br>&nbsp;2:XX | XX + 90<br>&nbsp;3:XX | XX + 150<br>&nbsp;4:XX | XX + 210<br>&nbsp;5:XX | XX + 270<br>------+---------<br>&nbsp;time | elapsed<br>------+---------<br>&nbsp;7:XX | XX<br>&nbsp;8:XX | XX + 60<br>&nbsp;9:XX | XX + 120<br>------+---------<br>&nbsp;time | elapsed<br>------+---------<br>&nbsp;9:XX | XX - 59<br>10:XX | XX + 1<br>11:XX | XX + 61<br>12:XX | XX + 121<br>&nbsp;1:XX | XX + 181<br>&nbsp;2:XX | XX + 241<br></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

During each phase, a measurement was taken, resulting in a positive integer of magnitude at most&nbsp;<em>k</em>. The scientist knew that an individual experiment was designed in a way such that its measurements were monotonically increasing, that is, each measurement would be at least as big as all that precede it. For example, here is a sequence of measurements for one such experiment with <em>n=13</em> and <em>k=6</em>:<blockquote><nobr>1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6</nobr></blockquote></p><p>It was also the case that <em>n</em> was to be larger than <em>k</em>, and so there were typically many repeated values in the measurement sequence. Being mad, the scientist chose a somewhat unusual way to record the data. Rather than record each of <em>n</em>&nbsp;measurements, the scientist recorded a sequence&nbsp;<em>P</em> of <em>k</em> values defined as follows. For <nobr><em>1 &le; j &le; k</em></nobr>, <em>P(j)</em> denoted the number of phases having a measurement of <em>j</em> or less. For example, the original measurements from the above experiment were recorded as the <nobr><em>P</em>-sequence</nobr>:<blockquote><nobr>2, 7, 7, 8, 12, 13</nobr></blockquote>as there were two measurements less than or equal to 1, seven measurements less than or equal to 2, seven measurement less than or equal to 3, and so on.</p><p>Unfortunately, the scientist eventually went insane, leaving behind a notebook of these <nobr><em>P</em>-sequences</nobr> for a series of experiments.

In this problem, we explore a particular approach based on a hierarchical decomposition of the image. For simplicity, we consider only bitmapped images such as the following:<center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4926a.png></center></p><p>The image is encoded as a tree, with the root representing the entire image region. If a region is monochromatic, then the node for that region is a leaf storing the color of the region. Otherwise, the region is divided into four parts about its center, and the approach is applied recursively to each quadrant. For a non-leaf node, its four children represent the four quadrants ordered as upper-right, upper-left, lower-left, lower-right respectively. As an example, here is the tree encoding of the above image.<center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4926a.png></center>The original image is not monochromatic, so we considered the four quadrants. The top-right quadrant is monochromatic white, so the first child of the root node is a leaf with value 0. The top-left quadrant is not monochromatic, so it is further divided into four subquadrants, each of which is trivially monochromatic. This results in the subtree with leaf values <nobr>0, 0, 1, 0</nobr>. The final two quadrants are monochromatic with respective values 0 and 1.</p><p>As a larger example, here is an 8x8 image and the tree encoding of it.<center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4926a.png></center><br><center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4926a.png></center></p><p>Thus far we have described a <em>lossless</em> compression scheme, but the approach can be used for <em>lossy</em> compression with the following adjustment. Instead of continuing the decomposition until reaching a monochromatic region, a threshold such as 75% is used, and a leaf is created whenever a region has at least that percentage of either color. As an example, here is the encoding of the above 8x8 image if using 75% as the threshold.<center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4926a.png></center>Notice that 75% of the top-left quadrant of the full image is black, and therefore the second child of the root is&nbsp;1, and that more than 75% of the bottom-left quadrant of the full image is white, and therefore the third child of the root is&nbsp;0. However, neither white nor black reaches 75% in the top-right quadrant, so the recursive decomposition continues, but all four of those subquadrants achieve the 75% threshold and become leaves. If we were to uncompress the image based on this new lossy encoding, we get back the following result.<center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4926a.png></center></p><p>Your goal is to determine the image that results from this lossy compression scheme, given an original bitmap image and a specific threshold percentage.</p><p><b>Input:</b> The input will consist of a series of data sets, followed by a line containing only 0. Each data set begins with a line containing values W and T, where W is the width of the bitmap and T is the threshold percentage.

Adding a certain symbol to the hieroglyph for an integer was understood to represent the reciprocal of that integer. This made it easy to write any fraction of the form <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>N</span></span> (called a <dfn>unit fraction</dfn>)&mdash;simply add the reciprocal symbol to the hieroglyph for N.</p><p>There was no direct way to represent a fraction of the form <span class="fraction"><span>M</span><span>N</span></span>, where M &gt; 1. Instead, any such fraction was written as the sum of unit fractions. For example, the fraction <span class="fraction"><span>3</span><span>4</span></span> could be written as:</p><p class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span>3</span><span>4</span></span> = <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>2</span></span> + <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>4</span></span></p><p>Notice that multiple sums may yield the same result; for example, <span class="fraction"><span>3</span><span>4</span></span> can also be written as</p><p class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span>3</span><span>4</span></span> = <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>3</span></span> + <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>4</span></span> + <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>6</span></span></p><p>Your job is to take a fraction <span class="fraction"><span>M</span><span>N</span></span> and write it as a sum of unit fractions by way of a &ldquo;greedy&rdquo; search. In a greedy search you continually subtract the largest unit fraction possible until you are left with zero. For example, consider the fraction <span class="fraction"><span>9</span><span>20</span></span>. A greedy search would find the sum <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>3</span></span> + <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>9</span></span> + <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>180</span></span> in three steps, like so:</p><p class="formula">(1.) <span class="fraction"><span>9</span><span>20</span></span> - <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>3</span></span> = <span class="fraction"><span>7</span><span>60</span></span>,&nbsp; (2.) <span class="fraction"><span>7</span><span>60</span></span> - <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>9</span></span> = <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>180</span></span>,&nbsp; (3.) <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>180</span></span> - <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>180</span></span> = 0</p><p>Note that at each step we subtracted the largest possible unit fraction from whatever remained of our original fraction.</p><p>One additional restriction must be added to keep our solutions from becoming too large: Each time we subtract a unit fraction, we must be left with a fraction whose denominator is strictly less than 1,000,000. For example, consider the fraction <span class="fraction"><span>17</span><span>69</span></span>. The first two unit fractions we would subtract would be <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>5</span></span> and <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>22</span></span>, leaving us with <span class="fraction"><span>7</span><span>7590</span></span>. At this point, the largest unit fraction we could subtract would be <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>1085</span></span>, leaving us with</p><p class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span>7</span><span>7590</span></span> - <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>1085</span></span> = <span class="fraction"><span>1519</span><span>1647030</span></span> - <span class="fraction"><span>1518</span><span>1647030</span></span> = <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>1647030</span></span></p><p>Unfortunately, this leaves us with a fraction whose denominator is larger than 1,000,000, so we can <em>not</em> use this unit fraction in our sum. We move on to the next largest unit fraction, <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>1086</span></span>, which leaves us with</p><p class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span>7</span><span>7590</span></span> - <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>1086</span></span> = <span class="fraction"><span>1267</span><span>1373790</span></span> - <span class="fraction"><span>1265</span><span>1373790</span></span> = <span class="fraction"><span>2</span><span>1373790</span></span> = <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>686895</span></span></p><p>Since the final answer reduces to a fraction with a denominator less than 1,000,000, we <em>can</em> use this unit fraction, leaving us with a final answer of <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>5</span></span> + <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>22</span></span> + <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>1086</span></span> + <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>686895</span></span>.</p><p>In this case we only had to skip over a single fraction. In general, however, you may have to skip over many fractions in order to find one that will work. While you are searching, you will have to perform calculations on many fractions with large denominators; make sure you do so efficiently, or your program may take too long to execute.</p><p>You should also make sure you are using a data type large enough to hold the large numbers you are working with. Even though we have restricted denominators to 1,000,000, you may have to calculate intermediate values with denominators up to 10<sup>12</sup>. A 64-bit integer will be required to hold such values (<code>long</code> in Java, <code>long long</code> in C/C++).</p><p>Finally, it might be worth noting that, by its very nature, the greedy algorithm will always find some answer consisting of fractions with denominators less than 1,000,000 since, at the very least, any fraction can be represented as a sum of unit fractions with its own denominator. For example:</p><p class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span>3</span><span>999983</span></span> = <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>999983</span></span> + <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>999983</span></span> + <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>999983</span></span></p><p><b>Input:</b>&nbsp; The input will consist of a sequence of fractions;  one per line. Each line will contain only two integers <var>M</var> and <var>N</var>, where 1&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;M&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;N&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;100, representing the fraction <span class="fraction"><span>M</span><span>N</span></span>.&nbsp; M and N will have no common divisors greater than 1. The end of the input will be indicated by two zeros: 0&nbsp;0.</p><p><b>Output:</b>&nbsp; For each input fraction <span class="fraction"><span>M</span><span>N</span></span> you are to output a single line containing numbers <var>D<sub>1</sub></var> &le; <var>D<sub>2</sub></var> &le; <var>D<sub>3</sub></var> &le; &hellip; such that:</p><p class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span>M</span><span>N</span></span> = <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>D<sub>1</sub></span></span> + <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>D<sub>2</sub></span></span> + <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>D<sub>3</sub></span></span> + &hellip;</p><p>This should be the first sum arrived at using a greedy search while enforcing the denominator bound of 1,000,000.

<p>Thibodeaux is the biggest fan of Arthur Conan Mysterio's series of detective novels. He has read each of them as soon as they were published, and had tried to get his friend Boudreau to read them as well. But Boudreau has a penchant against reading, so he has waited for the all movies to come out. And finally, this fall, the last movie in the series is being released. So Boudreau is planning to watch all of the movies in a row.</p><p>Thibodeaux, however, reminded him that Mysterio has done an amazing job at putting surprising plot twists and clues in each of the stories. So Boudreau realizes that after he watches each of the movies once, he should watch it a second time so that, now knowing who the villains are, he can spot the clues.</p><p>But the situation is even more complicated than that. Mysterio was very clever with his novels, and put clues in the earlier books to the cases in the the later ones. This means that Boudreau is going to, after watching each movie, go back and watch each of the previous movies in the series and then re-watch the current movie.</p><p>Boudreau realizes that this may take a lot of time, so he wants your help to figure out how long he will spend watching all these movies. He knows how long each of the movies is, and he has Thibodeaux around to instantaneously take out each movie and put in the next movie to watch.

<p>As a scientist, you regularly deal with data collected from many 
ongoing experiments. The data each experiment produces is a very 
long binary sequence, where each bit represents a result (0 or 1) at 
a particular time. You have a suspicion that many of the experiments 
demonstrate cyclic behavior with a particular period. That is, the 
data they produce repeats at regular time intervals. However, youÃ¢Â€Â™re 
not certain. You want to analyze the data and see if they support your 
hunch.</p>

<p>One of your staff has taken multiple samples (called 
Ã¢Â€Â˜finite fingerprintsÃ¢Â€Â™) from each experimentÃ¢Â€Â™s data sequence. Each 
fingerprint is of the same length Ã¢Â€Â“ the length of the suspected period. 
It is convenient that each fingerprintÃ¢Â€Â™s length is always a multiple of 
six, because it allows your staff member to encode the fingerprint in 
base-64 to compress it and send it to you.</p>

<p>You know that if an experiment produces cyclic data, then any two 
fingerprints from its sequence will have exactly the same order of 
bits. However, they might be time-shifted because the fingerprints 
started at different times during the cycle. For example, suppose 
that the underlying sequence is cyclic and looks like this:</p>

<pre>
...001011001011001011001011...
</pre>

<p>Then if we take 3 fingerprints at random from this sequence of 
length 6, we might get 001011, 011001, and 100101. All of these can 
be cyclically shifted (i.e. move bits from the end to the beginning, 
or vice-versa) so that they are identical. Thus, these fingerprints 
support your theory.</p>

<p>Write a program that will help you analyze which fingerprints might 
represent the same cyclic behavior and group them together.</p>

<p>Base-64 encodes six bits in each character, using big-endian 
encoding (the most significant bit is given first). The characters 
representing these values are (in order) <tt>A-Z</tt>, <tt>a-z</tt>, 
<tt>0-9</tt>, <tt>+</tt>, and <tt>/</tt>. Thus, the string Ã¢Â€Â˜<tt>At4/</tt>Ã¢Â€Â™ 
represents the bit sequence Ã¢Â€Â˜<tt>000000 101101 111000 111111</tt>Ã¢Â€Â™ (with 
spaces added for clarity).</p>

<p>Hoverdia Eighteen is a number puzzle game similar to Sudoku, 
which gets its name from the restrictions placed on the puzzle 
in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions.  The game is 
played on an eight-by-eight grid. The game has two rules:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Each row and column must contain the numbers one through eight, inclusive, with no duplicates.</li>
    <li>Each of the four-by-four quarters of the puzzle must contain numbers such that the sum of any row, column, or diagonal is eighteen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write a program to determine the validity of a proposed solution to this game.</p>

<p>Boudreau never was that good of a cook. In fact he has to use a cheat sheet to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. In fact, the recipe looks something like:</p><pre>bread peanut_butter jelly bread</pre><p>Each token represents one step in the process of making the sandwich. And it is important that the steps be followed in the order listed. For example "<tt>bread jelly peanut_butter bread</tt>" is not a peanut butter and sandwich according to Boudreau's recipe. (Though he would probably still enjoy eating it.)</p><p>Most of the simple recipes that Boudreau can follow are all similar to that one. Steps that must be followed in order. However Boudreau does have the ability to follow some more complicated recipes. For instance, when he wants meat on his sandwiches then he can use the following recipe:</p><pre>bread ( turkey | ham ) bread</pre><p>This recipe uses the special symbol '|' which means that the chef can decide to use either the previous or next operand, but not both. So following this recipe, the cook will end up with either "<tt>bread turkey bread</tt>" or "<tt>bread ham bread</tt>". Notice also the use of parentheses, which act to group parts of the recipes, much as they do in mathematical equations. And just like in mathematical equations order of operations is important. When multiple steps are on either side of a '|' either all the steps on the left or all the steps on the right should be followed. To demonstrate this use is the following recipe:</p><pre>bread ( peanut_butter jelly | bacon lettuce tomato ) bread</pre><p>Following this recipe will result in "<tt>bread peanut_butter jelly bread</tt>" or "<tt>bread bacon lettuce tomato bread</tt>". So Boudreau will end up with either a PB&amp;J or BLT.</p><p>There is one last rule in the recipes that Boudreau uses. There is a special symbol '$' which means not to do anything. In the simplest of recipes, this symbol can be ignored and therefore doesn't add anything useful. But when used with '|' it can be very useful:</p><pre>bread $ peanut_butter $ jelly $ bread
bun patty ( cheese | $ ) bun</pre><p>The first of the above two recipes can only be used to make the simple peanut butter and jelly sandwich, so although the '$'s don't add anything semantically to the recipe it is still a valid recipe. With the second recipe, the '$' is more important. Boudreau can either use cheese, in which case he'll make a cheeseburger ("<tt>bun patty cheese bun</tt>"), or he can choose the '$', in which case he'll make a plain hamburger ("<tt>bun patty bun</tt>").</p><p>Thibodeaux, however, is a rather more accomplished chef that Boudreau. He can cook any of the recipes that Boudreau can cook, plus he understands recipes that use another special symbol, '*'. The symbol '*' means that the previous step can be performed any number of times. As a special case it can be performed 0 times. The '*' only applies to the immediately preceding step, which will be either a token or a sub-recipe contained in parentheses. Thibodeaux uses this symbol to make his specialty, Gumbo:</p><pre>get_out_pot ( pick_random_item place_in_pot ) * heat_pot</pre><p>Notice how the two steps pick_random_item and place_in_pot need to both be in parentheses in order for the '*' to be applied to both of them. Following this recipe, Thibodeaux can put an unlimited number of random items into his Gumbo.</p><p>Although Thibodeaux makes a mean Gumbo, there are still recipes that are beyond even his ability. These recipes use another rule, a '<tt>goto</tt>'. A special step of the form <tt>&lt;goto:label&gt;</tt> is used to mean that once the recipe gets to that step, the chef should immediately continue the recipe at the step of the form <tt>&lt;label&gt;</tt>, called the target. If any goto is used, then there will be one and only one corresponding target. There may be several gotos which refer to the same target. If a target is encountered in the recipe then it is treated as a '$', in that no step should be performed.</p><p>There are many interesting properties that such recipes can have, and the following examples demonstrate a few of them:</p><pre>bread turkey &lt;goto:skip_pickles&gt; pickles &lt;skip_pickles&gt; bread
hatch_idea &lt;scheme&gt; scheme &lt;goto:scheme&gt; 
catch_roadrunner</pre><p>There may be a step ,which is unreachable, or the recipe may fall into an infinite loop, in which case there are no valid outcomes. Boudreau and Thibodeaux have several recipes. They have also made several attempts to follow each recipe. They want you to write a program to tell if their attempts have succeeded.</p><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>The input will begin with a line containing a single integer R indicating the number of recipes.</p><p>The description of each recipe will be on two lines.

<p>When climbing a section or Ã¢Â€ÂœpitchÃ¢Â€Â� the lead climber ascends first, 
taking a rope with them that they anchor to the rock for protection to 
ascend. Once at the top of a pitch, the lead climber has the second 
climber attach to the rope, so they can ascend with the safety of the 
rope. Once the second climber reaches the top of the pitch, the third 
attaches, and so on until all the climbers have ascended.</p>

<o>For example, for a 10 meter pitch and 50 meter rope, at most 6 
climbers could ascend, with the last climber attaching to the end of 
the rope. To ascend safely, there must be at least 2 climbers and the 
rope must be at least as long as the pitch.</p>

<p>This process is repeated on each pitch of the climb, until the top 
is reached. Then to descend, the climbing rope is hung at its midpoint 
from an anchor (each half must reach the ground). The climbers then each 
rappel from this rope. The rope is retrieved from the anchor by pulling 
one side of the rope, slipping it though the anchor and allowing it to 
fall to the ground.  To descend safely, the rope must be at least twice 
as long as the sum of the lengths of the pitches.</p>

<p>For example, a 60 meter rope is required to rappel from a 30 
meter climb, no matter how many climbers are involved.</p>

<p>Climbing ropes come in 50, 60 and 70 meter lengths. It is 
best to take the shortest rope needed for a given climb because 
this saves weight. You are to determine the maximum number of 
climbers that can use each type of rope on a given climb.</p>

<p>It is known that prime numbers have many applications in 
mathematics, public-key cryptography, computer science, music, 
alien language processing, and so on.  It was conjectured, by 
Goldbach, in a letter sent to Euler in 1742, that any even number 
can be written as a sum of two prime numbers, but he cannot find 
a proof of this. For example, <tt>4 = 2 + 2</tt> and there is no other 
combination. However, some even numbers have two or more 
combination, such as, <tt>10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5</tt>. Note that 
based on commutativity, the combination <tt>10 = 7 + 3</tt> is 
not counted. Ã¢Â€Â¨Given two positive even integers, say L and U, 
larger than 3 and smaller than 100000, you are supposed to 
find the most used prime number in all the combinations of 
even numbers between L and U. If there is more than one number, 
you need to print them all. The last line should be the number 
of their occurrences.</p>

An atlas divides a map into separate pages in a process called
<i>pagination.</i>  Pagination starts with laying a rectangular grid over the area to
be mapped.  Some of the grid divisions will not contain an area to
be mapped-these are excluded.  The remaining grid divisions are 
assigned page numbers, proceeding from left to right and top to 
bottom.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An atlas is usable due to the references that direct the reader to the pages that
hold adjacent portions of the map.  Your team is to write a program 
that will produce these references.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The following steps describe how the references are assigned to the 
atlas pages:


<ul><li> Overlay a rectangular grid on the area the be mapped.
<li> Exclude grid elements that do not
contain any area to be mapped (see the shaded regions of
Figure&nbsp;1).
<li> Moving left-to-right, top-to-bottom, assign a sequential page
number to each unshaded grid element, starting with page 1.  For any grid
page that contains an adjacent page, the corresponding margin must contain a
reference to that adjacent page.  In Figure&nbsp;1, the reference in the 
left margin of page&nbsp;13 is to refer the reader to page&nbsp;12, and the 
bottom margin is to refer the reader to page&nbsp;16.  The top and
right margins do not contain a reference.</ul>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2> 

Input to your program represents a series of rectangular grids used to overlay a map.
The first line of each grid contains two integers, <i>R</i> and <i>C</i>, separated by exactly one space.  <i>R</i> is the number of rows in the grid, and <i>C</i>
is the number of columns in the grid.  
The following <i>R</i> lines
describe the shading of the grid elements.  
The first
character of the second line corresponds to the upper left element of the
grid.  A capital `X' describes a 
shaded element, whereas a dot `.' indicates an unshaded element.  
<i>R</i> and <i>C</i> will be in the range 1-30 inclusive.  
There will always be at least one unshaded grid element.  The last grid will
be followed by the end-of-file.

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Output for each map is a series of lines, one line per unshaded grid element (printed
page). Each line must contain exactly five integers separated by single spaces,
of the form

<div class="p"><!----></div>
   <i>p</i> <i>t</i> <i>r</i> <i>b</i> <i>l</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 where <i>p</i> is the page number, and <i>t</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>l</i> are the top, right,
bottom, and left margin references of page <i>p</i>.  If a particular margin is
to remain empty (no adjacent grid page), print a page number of 0. Print page definitions in
ascending page number order.  No leading or trailing whitespace is to 
appear on an output line.  Print an empty line after the information
for the last page of each grid is printed.

The staff of Swamp County College were well into their eleventh year of hosting a 
regional computer programming contest when they realized they were running out of
time to prepare t-shirts for the contest day.  For the previous ten years, 
the staff had always purchased shirts after the registration period closed, 
buying just enough shirts  and assigning each school a shirt color from its 
school colors.  Alas, this year the t-shirts had to be purchased prior to 
the closing of registration.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Although the staff could not predict which schools would enter, they could 
make a good estimate of projected attendance by the day they had to commit 
to a t-shirt contract.  The staff decided that this year a single shirt color 
would be used, with the shirt order from the year with highest attendance as 
a good representation of the distribution of sizes.  On the day the t-shirt 
order is due, the staff will project the expected attendance and scale 
the order according to the size distribution.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Your team is to write a program that takes representative distributions of 
shirt sizes, and given the projected attendance, produces t-shirt counts for
each size.

</H2> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Input to the program is a series of lines of text, 
each containing eight integers separated from each other by single spaces.
The first 
seven values represent the number of t-shirts previously purchased, <i>n</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, 
corresponding to sizes XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, and XXXL, respectively.  Summing the first seven 
values, <i>N</i>=<font face="symbol">&sum;</font
><i>n</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, yields the total number of shirts previously ordered.
  The eighth value is <i>P</i>, the projected attendance.  Input is terminated by
the end-of-file.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

It is likely that the above computation of <i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> will produce a shortage of t-shirts,
<i>S</i> = <i>P</i> <font face="symbol">-</font

><i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>,
that is greater than zero.  In this case, from smallest (XS) to largest (XXXL), start
filling empty size counts (<i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>=0) with one shirt until <i>S</i>=0 or there are no empty size
counts.  If there is still a shortage, purchase additional shirts at size XL to force <i>S</i>=0.
<p>
<i>N</i> and <i>P</i> are guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

You are employed by a secret government agency that communicates with its field agents via
encrypted messages only.
The Agency is sending you to a location that does not have electricity, so you must
send reports by scratching encrypted short messages onto tree bark and floating
the bark down river for recovery by fellow agents.
Five hours before departure, you consider it wise to provide a decryption program so that
the Agency can decipher your important communications.

<p>
You will use a <i>numerically keyed aperiodic polyalphabetic cipher</i>.
Such a scheme changes the encipherment alphabet after a specified number of letters, given in 
a numerical key.
The numerical key describes how many characters to use in an encipherment alphabet before 
changing to a new alphabet.
You will actually use a single alphabet, but rotate the substitution based upon the keyword.
The decrypted (plain) alphabet consists of lowercase ASCII letters a-z and the space character.  
The encrypted (cipher) alphabet consists of uppercase ASCII letters A-Z and the space character.

<p>
Table 1 shows an encryption/decryption table based upon the codeword <i>BLUE</i> and
numerical key <i>2314</i>.  The plain-text
alphabet is displayed across the top as column headers.  The first column reading down
spells out the codeword, BLUE.  For each row, continue the cipher alphabet after the codeword character, cycling back to `A'
after the space character.  Use the numerical key to construct the last column of the table.
The numerical key does not become part of the encrypted message; it merely dictates how 
many characters to use from an encipherment alphabet before changing to the next alphabet.

<p>
Your program is to decrypt messages that were encrypted using this process:
Given the plain-text message "watson are you there", use the first row to substitute
two characters `w' and `a' with `X' and `B'.  Next, use the second row to substitute
the three characters `t' `s' `o' with `D' `C' `Z'.  Substitute one character, `n' with `G'.
Substitute the next four characters ` '<!--hbox-->&nbsp;(space) `a' `r' `e' with `D' `E' `V' `I'.  
Having exhausted the codeword and numerical keys (2 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 10 characters, change back
to the first row, and substitute the two characters ` '<!--hbox-->&nbsp;(space) `y' with `A' and `Z'.
Continue using the character counts 2-3-1-4-2-3-1-4-2-...  until the entire
message is enciphered.

<p>
Decryption is the reverse of encryption.  Given the cipher text "XBDCZGDEVIAZZEKMLIVI",
start at the first row and substitute two characters `X' and `B' with `w' and `a'.  Change to
the next alphabet on the second row and substitute three characters `D' `C' `Z' with `t' `s' `o'.
Continue as with encryption, using the character counts 2-3-1-4-2-3-1-4-2-...  until the
entire message is deciphered.

Input consists of two or more lines.  The first line contains the code word, a colon, and the 
numerical key.  The codeword is built from the characters A-Z only (no spaces).
A codeword may be 2-10 characters long.
For each letter in the code word, there will be a corresponding decimal digit
in the numerical key.  `0' (zero) will never occur in the numerical key.
  The remaining lines contain enciphered text, with each line 
being treated as a separate message.
Lines of enciphered text range between 1 and 79 characters.

There is an unusual road in Lancaster, California&mdash;it acts as a
musical instrument!  The road has grooves cut across it.  As a car
drives over the grooves the resulting vibrations are transmitted to
the car.  If the vibrations are at appropriate frequencies, musical
notes at standard frequencies are formed.  By cutting the proper
number of grooves in a road with the proper distance between them, a
car driven over the road at the proper speed will literally play a
tune.  The road in Lancaster is supposed to play the beginning of the
"William Tell Overture."

<p>
Each groove cut into the road causes one vibration as the tires 
cross over it.  By crossing the proper number of grooves per
second, a note is played.  For example, A below middle C
has a frequency of 220 Hz.  In order to play this note for one second,
the car must cross 220 grooves in that second.

<p>
There are twelve notes on the musical scale, listed below in order
of increasing frequency: 
<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&#x266F;/D&#x266D;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D&#x266F;/E&#x266D;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
E &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&#x266F;/G&#x266D;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G&#x266F;/A&#x266D;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A&#x266F;/B&#x266D;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
The seven natural notes are represented by the upper-case letters A
through G.  The other five notes are referred to by using either
a note letter followed by a sharp symbol (&#x266F;&mdash;meaning one
note higher), or a note letter followed by a flat symbol
(&#x266D;&mdash;meaning one note lower).  We will use `#' to represent the
sharp symbol and lower case `b' to represent the flat symbol.

<p>
An <i>octave</i> is made up of the twelve notes listed above, from C to
B.  The note above B is C in the next octave.  A note is represented
by its letter followed by an optional sharp or flat symbol and its
octave number.  Octaves are represented by single digits.

<p>
The frequency of a given note is a factor of <sup><font size="-2">12 </font></sup><font face="symbol">&radic;</font>2 higher
than the previous note.  Frequencies are determined by using the 
A note in octave 4 as a base.  A4 has a frequency of 440 Hz.
Therefore, A&#x266F;4 has a frequency of (440 &times; <sup><font size="-2">12 </font></sup><font face="symbol">&radic;</font>2) Hz, and A3 has a frequency 
that is half of A4 (220 Hz).  The musical road uses octaves 2 through 5.

<p>
Each note has a duration associated with it.  These durations are 
referred to as full, half, quarter, or eighth notes.  (A half note
is played for half the duration of a full note, a quarter note for 
a quarter of the duration of a full note, and so on.)  The specifications for
the musical road will give the number of quarter notes to be played 
per minute.  The  duration of a note can be increased by 50% by placing
a dot (`.') after the note-so a dotted half-note would be played 
for 75% as long as a full note.

<p>
Rests occur in a song when no note is playing.  No grooves would be 
cut in the road for the duration of a rest.  Rest durations are also
measured in terms of whole, half, quarter, and eighth notes, and can
also be dotted to increase their duration by 50%.

<p>
Your team is to write a program that will, given a target road
speed along with the notes and tempo for a song, will produce the 
required groove counts and distance between grooves needed for each
note or rest in the song.

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2> 
Input to your program will be a series of songs ending with the 
end-of-file.  The input for each
song will be as follows:
The first line will contain the targeted road speed in miles per 
hour as an integer, followed by a single space and the integer tempo 
in quarter notes per minute.  
The remaining lines will contain notes to be played on the road.
Each note will be given as a capital letter, an optional sharp
(`#') or flat (`b') sign, a single digit representing the octave,
a single digit representing the note duration (1, 2, 4, or 8 for full,
half, quarter, or eighth note respectively), and an optional dot.
Rests will be represented by the letter `R', a note duration digit,
and an optional dot.
Notes will be separated
from each other by one or more spaces.  Each song will end with 
an empty line.
 
<p>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2> 

For each note, your program is to print a line containing the number of 
grooves rounded to the nearest integer and the distance between the 
grooves in feet and inches to the 
nearest 1/8 inch.  
For a rest, print a groove count of zero followed
by the proper distance.  The rounding of the groove count and distance
are to occur after both values are computed.

<p>
Each output line is to be printed in the following format:
 

<ul><li>The output line is to begin with the groove count followed by a colon.
<li>The distance is to be printed after the colon using the following 
format, where the 
components in square brackets are only to be printed if needed:
<br>
[(space)(whole feet)<tt>&#39;</tt>][(space)(whole inches)][(space)(fractional inches)][<tt>&quot;</tt>]
<li> 
Omit any elements that have zero values. 
<li>Fractions are to be printed in reduced form.
<li>No trailing space is to appear on an output line.  
<li>Print an empty line at the end of each song (including the last).
</ul>If two identical notes appear in the input, print the groove count and
spacing for each note&mdash;your program is not to consider the spacing 
between notes.

<p>
<i>Hint:</i>  There are 12 inches in a foot and 5280 feet in a mile.

The time has come for Triangle City to 
re-draw the city council district boundaries.  Triangle City is so named
because the city limits form a triangle.  The city is not large (its
population varies, but has never exceeded 30,000), so the city
council has only three members.
Fortunately, the population of the city is a multiple of three.

<p>
The last redistricting was very political and resulted in
gerrymandered districts.  In order to prevent that from happening 
again, the city charter now requires that 
the three districts not only contain the same number of people, but
that they be split on a single point.  The district boundaries will
be formed by connecting the splitting point to each vertex of the 
boundary triangle, resulting in three triangular council districts.

<p>
Your team is to write a program that, given the boundaries of 
the city and the locations of the residents on a Cartesian grid, will
find a suitable single splitting point.

No two people occupy the same point.  
It is guaranteed that 
there exists a splitting point. It is not guaranteed that such a splitting point

   While going through the Swamp County College archives some strange drawings
were discovered. They appear to specify some sort of computing device and
seem to be written in 
a predecessor of today's relay logic ladder diagrams which 
are used for Programmable Logic Controllers. 
Luckily it isn't necessary to understand relay logic to understand them
since they can easily be translated to boolean equations.
Your job is to read in the diagram of a module and
a list of input states, simulate the module, and produce the
output each time the input changes.

<p>
See Figure 1 for a simple diagram and the equivalent boolean equation.

<p>
The components of a diagram are gates (relay contacts) and gate controllers
(relay coils).
The diagrams are called
ladder logic because you can picture the ladder rails as the power buses
at each side of the diagram and the rungs as connected lines with one
and only one
connection to each bus on the left and right. The controllers can have no
other components (gates or controllers) between them and the 
right hand bus, only wires.  All gates are to the left of the controllers.
Gates in series are an AND circuit and gates in parallel
are an OR circuit. A controller is set to the results of the equations
determined by the gates to its left. In turn, its associated gates 
are set by the
state of the controller. 

<p>
Input gates are set either by the outputs of another module or some
input device. Output controllers can set the inputs of another module,
control an output device, or control their associated gates in the diagram.
Relay controllers may only control their associated gates in the diagram.

<p>
 The rules for the character representation of the relay ladder logic diagrams
follow:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<ul><li> The left and right rails are not drawn. Wires are drawn with `-' characters.
There will always be at least one `-' between components.
<li> Gates (which include input, relay, and output gates) are drawn
enclosed in square brackets. There are up to ten possible input 
gates X0-X9,
up to ten possible output gates Y0-Y9, and up to 100
possible relay gates R00-R99. Each of these may appear multiple
times in the diagram and in any rung. 
They take either the boolean value of the associated
input or controller, for example, [R18] or its logical negation [!R18].
The numbering is arbitrary-for example, a given diagram may only 
use X2, X5, and X8 as inputs.
<li> Gates can be connected in series, parallel, or a combination.
<li> Controllers appear in the diagram enclosed in parentheses.  There are up to ten possible output controllers Y0-Y9 and up 
to 100 possible relay controllers R00-R99.
A given controller may appear only once in a diagram.  
A controller will appear if its corresponding gate appears. 
However, a controller may appear without
any corresponding gate. Controller numbering is arbitrary.
<li> Only controllers can connect to the right rail.
Every rung has at least one controller connecting to the right rail.
Controllers may not appear in series, only in
parallel on a rung. If controllers appear in parallel they each take the 
value determined by the boolean equation of all the gates to the left
of their common junction on the rung.
<li>  Connections can only be made to adjacent lines within
a rung. A connection to a lower line is indicated by `U' and to an upper 
line by `L'. These indicators must line up properly on the two lines. 
There will be at least one `-' between a connector and a component.
 </ul>

The diagram is drawn so logic always flows to the right, assuming
the left rail is the source, or up or down one line at one of the
connector pairs. 

<p>
These diagrams do not have any race or other anomalous conditions, such as 
"<tt>---[!R0]--(R0)---</tt>",
so the controllers are guaranteed to settle into a stable state in a short time
but it is very likely several iterations will be needed before they do so.

<p>
On initial power up, all inputs and controllers are off, which is logical 0.

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2> 
<p>
 The input diagram is a series of lines of at most 72 characters,
terminated by an empty line. To save typing, a line ending in 
"<tt>-&#62;</tt>" is
considered to extend to the right rail. There are at most 100 lines in the
diagram.

<p>
The test inputs follow, one case per line,
terminated by end of file. Each test case consists
of exactly ten binary digits (`0' for off and `1' for on) 
with the left digit being X0 and the
rightmost digit being X9. Any input not appearing in the diagram is
ignored. There are at most 100 test inputs.

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2> 
Your program is to first print the outputs after the power on transients have settled, then
apply each input in turn and print the outputs when they have settled. Note
that this means applying each input to the state resulting from the previous
test case, not power cycling the module between cases. Also note that the execution
order is not specified, since relays run on their own time.

<p>

Swamp County College has joined the TinySat consortium which will
design and fly a series of small satellite experiments. You are on
the team that is designing the electronics package.  Electronic parts
that can withstand the stresses of space travel are known as 
<i>space qualified</i> parts.  Space qualified parts are rugged and 
made to
extremely tight tolerances.  While extremely accurate, these parts
are also very expensive so you have access to an inventory with a
limited number of component values.

<p>
The circuits you are building include resistors with values that will not
be known until after the actual circuit is built.  The needed resistor
values will be determined by calibration using
variable resistors which are not space qualified.
There will be space left on the circuit board for up to
three space qualified fixed resistors in various configurations 
to substitute for 
each variable resistor.  These configurations are shown in Figure 1. 

<p>
The resistance values <i>R</i> for each configuration (in order from 
simplest to most complex) are:

<p>

<table>
<tr><td> <i>A</i>: <i>R</i> = <i>R</i>1 </td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Single resistor</td></tr>
<tr><td> <i>B</i>: <i>R</i> = <i>R</i>1 + <i>R</i>2 </td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two resistors in series</td></tr>
<tr><td> <i>C</i>: <i>R</i> = [1/(1/<i>R</i>1 + 1/<i>R</i>2)] </td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two resistors in parallel</td></tr>
<tr><td> <i>D</i>: <i>R</i> = <i>R</i>1 + <i>R</i>2 + <i>R</i>3 </td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three resistors in series</td></tr>
<tr><td> <i>E</i>: <i>R</i> = [1/(1/<i>R</i>1 + 1/<i>R</i>2 + 1/<i>R</i>3)] </td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three resistors in parallel</td></tr>
<tr><td> <i>F</i>: <i>R</i> = <i>R</i>1 + [1/(1/<i>R</i>2 + 1/<i>R</i>3)] </td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three resistors
in series-parallel</td></tr></table>


<p>
Resistor values are real numbers possibly followed by `k' or `m' (upper
or lower case). A `k' means multiply the value by 1,000 and `m' by
1,000,000.

<p>
Your team is to write a program that will find a close enough match 
to a specified variable resistor value 
using the space qualified resistor values in the inventory in one of
the configurations listed above.

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2> 
Input to your program will begin with a series of lines 
containing the space qualified resistor values in the inventory.
Each line will contain one or more resistor values, separated from
each other by whitespace. The values are in no particular order. 
Each value appears only once.  You may use the same value multiple times in
a solution.  There will be no more than 100 resistor values in the 
inventory.  The inventory is terminated by an empty line.

<p>
Desired target resistor values and the tolerance of a match follow,
one case per line, terminated by end of file. The resistor value is
first and is separated by whitespace from the tolerance.

<p>
The tolerance is a real number expressed as a percentage-a value of
10 means 10%.   If the target variable resistor value is 1000 with a
tolerance of 10, then any value for <i>R</i> in the range 900-1100 would
be considered a match.

<p>
Resistor values in the inventory as well as those to be matched will 
be in the range 1 to 5,000,000.  The tolerance values will range 
from 0.0001% to 25%.

<p>
If there are matches 
in several configurations, choose the simplest configuration.
Note that this
means that if there is a good enough solution in configuration <i>C</i>, for
example, choose that one even if there is a better solution in, say, <i>E</i>.

<p>
Within a configuration find the closest solution.
If there are several equally good solutions within a configuration, choose
the one with the smallest <i>R</i>1. If there are multiple equally good 
three-resistor solutions with the same <i>R</i>1, 
choose the one with the smallest <i>R</i>2.
 

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2> 
For each test case that has a close enough solution,
print the solution on a line as follows: the configuration letter; 
a single space; and the
selected inventory resistor values separated by single spaces,
without leading or trailing spaces.  
Order the resistor values: <i>R</i>1, <i>R</i>2, <i>R</i>3.
If there is no close enough solution, print the string "no result"
on a line by itself.
Print the resistor values with three digits and at least one significant digit
before any decimal point, followed by `K' or `M' (upper case only) if
necessary.

For example, the whole country can be divided into unit squares that are either grass or swamp. Also, the country is famous for its incapable bureaucrats. If you want to buy a piece of land (called a parcel), you can only buy a rectangular area, because they cannot handle other shapes. The price of the parcel is determined by them and is proportional to the perimeter of the parcel, since the bureaucrats are unable to multiply integers and thus cannot calculate the area of the parcel.<div class="p"></div>Per owns a parcel in Absurdistan surrounded by swamp and he wants to sell it, possibly in parts, to some buyers. When he sells a rectangular part of his land, he is obliged to announce this to the local bureaucrats. They will first tell him the price he is supposed to sell it for. Then they will write down the name of the new owner and the coordinates of the south-east corner of the parcel being sold. If somebody else already owns a parcel with a south-east corner at the same spot, the bureaucrats will deny the change of ownership.<div class="p"></div>Per realizes that he can easily trick the system. He can sell overlapping areas, because bureaucrats only check whether the south-east corners are identical.

Note that he can get more money by selling even more land. This figure corresponds to the case in the sample input.</center><div class="p"></div>Now Per would like to know how many parcels of each perimeter he needs to sell in order to maximize his profit. Can you help him? You may assume that he can always find a buyer for each piece of land, as long as it doesn't contain any swamps. Also, Per is sure that no square within his parcel is owned by somebody else.<div class="p"></div><h3>Input</h3>On the first line a positive integer: the number of test cases, at most 100.

The company has the goal that each person in the city should be able to call each other person. Of course, it is not possible to build direct connections between every pair of persons. Instead, the company uses a network made up of several layers.<div class="p"></div>We denote a network switch in layer j by S(j). A switch S(0) consists of one input, one output and a cable connecting the input to the output. A switch S(j) with j &gt; 0 consists of 2<sup>j</sup> inputs, 2<sup>j</sup> outputs and two switches S(j&#8722;1). Input i of S(j) (0 &#8804; i &lt; 2<sup>j</sup>) is connected via a cable to the inputs i mod 2<sup>j&#8722;1</sup> of each of the two switches S(j&#8722;1). Similarly, output i of S(j) is connected to the outputs i mod 2<sup>j&#8722;1</sup> of each of the two switches S(j&#8722;1).<div class="p"></div><center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4952a.png /></center><center>Figure 1: The connections between a switch S(j) and the two switches S(j&#8722;1) it consists of.</center><div class="p"></div>We are considering a network with one switch S(n) in the outermost layer. It can be shown that any input and output of switch S(n) has a unique connection path to any of the S(0) switches. Therefore, any input of S(n) can be connected to any of its outputs, and the connection path is uniquely determined by specifying through which switch S(0) the connection is established.<div class="p"></div>We number the switches S(0) belonging to the switch S(n) from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup>&#8722;1. The i-th switch S(0) is defined as follows. Write the number i in binary as b<sub>n&#8722;1</sub>b<sub>n&#8722;2</sub>&#8230;b<sub>0</sub>. This defines a path from an input of S(n) to the i-th switch S(0) via the following procedure: for each j, b<sub>j</sub>=0 indicates that the path extends from S(j+1) to the first S(j) switch to which it is directly connected, and b<sub>j</sub>=1 indicates that the path extends to the second S(j) switch. Note that regardless of which input of S(n) is selected, this path arrives at the same S(0) switch, which is given the number i. See also the figure below the sample data for details of how the numbering works.<div class="p"></div>Sometimes multiple connections are needed at the same time. In order to avoid interference, each of the inputs and outputs of all switches S(j) (0 &#8804; j &#8804; n) can be used by at most one connection. Given a set of connection requests, can you find connection paths for each request such that the connection paths are disjoint?<div class="p"></div><h3>Input</h3>On the first line a positive integer: the number of test cases, at most 100.

For the opening scene he wants to have the main character, Wormly, cross Bridgely, the bridge. Wormly is a worm made of b equal circular bubbles and L legs. At all times each leg has to be under one of the bubbles, and under each bubble there can be at most one leg. Bridgely was supposed to be composed of n planks with the width of each plank equal to the diameter of each of Wormly's bubbles. However, some of the planks are missing.<div class="p"></div>At every moment, Wormly can do exactly one of the following:<ul><li>Move one of its legs forward over any number of (possibly missing) planks. After the move, the leg should be on a plank and underneath one of Wormly's bubbles. A leg isn't allowed to overtake other legs.<div class="p"></div></li><li>Move all of its bubbles forward one plank while its legs remain on the same planks. After the move each leg must still be under one of Wormly's bubbles.<div class="p"></div></li></ul><div class="p"></div><div class="p"></div><center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4953.png /></center><center>Figure 1: In this example, the only possible move for the last leg is to position b. (The plank at position a is missing, so the leg cannot move there. To get to position c, the last leg would have to overtake the first leg.) Also, in this example, moving all the bubbles forward is not allowed because Wormly's last leg would end up without a bubble over it.</center><div class="p"></div>Now Jonly is wondering how long the animation takes until Wormly reaches the end of Bridgely. Initially Wormly's bubbles are directly above the leftmost b planks of the bridge and its legs are on the leftmost L planks. At the end of the animation Wormly's bubbles have to be directly above the rightmost b planks and its legs have to be on the rightmost L planks.<div class="p"></div>The left- and rightmost L planks of Bridgely are not missing.<div class="p"></div><h3>Input</h3>On the first line a positive integer: the number of test cases, at most 100.

<P>The International Collegiate Soccer<SUP>1</SUP></A> Competition (ICSC) is famous for its well-kept rectangular stadiums. The grass playing fields in ICSC stadiums are always 100 meters long, and 75 meters wide. The grass is mowed every week with special lawn mowers, always using the same strategy: first, they make a series of passes along the length of the field, and then they do the same along the width of the field. All passes are straight lines, parallel to the sides of the field.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="958" HEIGHT="409" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4954.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p4954.eps}"></DIV><P>The ICSC has hired a new lawn-mower, Guido. Guido is very chaotic, and instead of covering the field incrementally, he likes to choose random starting positions for each of his passes. But he is afraid of not doing a good job and being fired by the ICSC, so he has asked you to help him. Write a program to make sure that the grass in the field is perfectly cut: all parts of the field have to be mowed at least once when the mower goes from end to end, and again when the mower goes from side to side.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Each test case contains 3 lines.

As you know, after the award ceremony of SWERC it is customary to publish a complete scoreboard with
detailed information on the submissions and verdicts received. However, due to the buggy contest
management system, most of the relevant data are not being recorded today. Clearly such state of affairs fails to meet the high 
standards we are committed to, so the judges have resolved to make up the rest of the data based on whatever shred of information left,
and hope contestants are unable to tell the difference. To make our lives even simpler, we kindly
ask you to provide a solution for us, or else today's scoreboard will remain forever veiled in
mystery (even the fake one).

<P>
What we will know by the end of the contest is the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> of teams, the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> of problems, and the number of accepted
submissions by each team. From the number and colour of balloons floating around on the premises we
will also be able to infer how many teams solved each of the problems. Your task is to figure
out which teams solved which problems.

<P>
Our counting skills are not up to par, so your program should be able to detect when the data
we collected must be wrong (see sample input 1). Otherwise you should output a possible solution,
   represented as a sequence of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> strings of
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> characters each, in the following way. Both problems and teams are
assigned with distinct integers, from <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1</SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1</SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>, respectively. For team number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>

<P>A DNA sequence is composed of a series of four possible nucleobases, namely Adenine, Guanine, Thymine and Cytosine; we will refer to each of these bases by their initial. For our purposes, nucleobases have an associated cyclic ``order'': <TT>A</TT> is followed by <TT>G</TT>, which in turn is followed by <TT>T</TT>, which is followed by <TT>C</TT>, which is followed by <TT>A</TT> again. State-of-the-art research in genomics has revealed the startling fact that many diseases are caused by certain subsequences of bases not forming a palindromic sequence! Your mission as a leading researcher at ICPC laboratories is to take a DNA string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> and a series of subsets <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>1</SUB>,..., <I>P</I><SUB>t</SUB></SPAN> of indices to characters (nucleobases) in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>, and transform <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> so that each of the restrictions of the resulting string to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>1</SUB>,..., <I>P</I><SUB>t</SUB></SPAN> are palindromic.

You are a hunter chasing a monkey in the forest, trying to shoot it down with your all-powerful
automatic machine gun. The monkey is hiding somewhere behind the branches of one of the trees, out of your sight. You can aim
at one of the trees and shoot; your
bullets are capable of going through the branches and killing the monkey instantly if it happens to
be in that tree. If it isn't, the monkey takes advantage of the time it takes you to reload and
takes a leap into a neighbouring tree without you noticing. It never stays in the same place after a shot. You would like to find out 
whether there is an strategy that
allows you to capture the monkey for sure, irrespective of its initial location and
subsequent jumps. If so, you need to determine the shortest sequence of shots guaranteeing this.

<P>
As an example, consider the situation in which there are only two neighboring trees in the forest
(left hand side of Figure 2). It is then possible to make sure you capture the monkey by shooting twice at
the same tree. Your first shot succeeds if the monkey happened to be there in the first place.
Otherwise, the monkey was behind the other tree and it
will necessarily have moved when you shoot for the second time.

<P>
However, depending on the shape of the forest it may not be possible for you to ensure victory. One example of this
is if there are three trees, all connected to one another (right hand side of Figure 2). No matter where you aim at, there are always two possible locations for the monkey at any given moment.
(Note that here we are
concerned with the worst-case scenario where the monkey may consistently guess your next target tree).

In response to a request by the SWERC 2010 problem-setting team, a sensor network has just been
installed in the headquarters. The organizing committee has put in the problem-setters the
disproportionate fear of suffering a leak of classified information about the problems.

<P>
Nevertheless, in the rush they forgot to think about the electricity network needed to
make the sensors work. Because of this, the security system is currently not working, but we
need to justify the great amount of resources invested in it, so the installation
must be ready before the end of the contest. Hence you are now asked to elaborate a program which will help the electrician in his duty.

<P>
Since the organizing committee spared no expense, they ordered the sensors from a prestigious
company. Every sensor is handcrafted and a number is written on each of them, whose meaning is
the recommended voltage that should be applied to it for correct operation. They can be used under
higher voltages, with an increasing risk of failure, but never with a voltage below the
recommended one. The electrician gazed open-mouthed at the sensors when they were given to him:
nearly all of them had different recommended voltages! The sensors were installed in the building in such a way that each of them
controls exactly two doors and every door is controlled by at least one sensor. Now is the time
for the electrician to supply power to the sensors. He faces the following constraints:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Fortunately, there is no need to activate all sensors. However, we will require that the subset
of sensors chosen to be on satisfy that every door is controlled by, at least, one sensor in the
subset.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Electricity is to be supplied to one of the active sensors, and then distributed to the others with wires.
In order not to waste wires, they can only be installed by connecting a pair of neighboring active sensors
(by ``neighbouring'' we mean that some door is controlled by both of them). Since we must supply energy to every active sensor, not every subset of
sensors is suitable as the chosen subset of working sensors.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Because of the above, all of the sensors will be supplied the same voltage, which cannot be
below the corresponding recommended voltages.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
For simplicity, we will refer to a subset of sensors satisfying the first two constraints above as
an admissible subset. The network is designed so that the set of all sensors is always admissible,
but we would like to take a possibly smaller subset so as to minimize the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">margin</SPAN>, defined as
the maximum of the differences, in absolute value, between the numbers written on each pair of
sensors in the subset. (This is to keep the chances of failure to a minimum).

<P>
The electrician could not solve the task of finding the admissible subset of the set of sensors
for which the margin is minimum. Therefore, the electrical installation is still missing. Today, we ask
you to write a program to find out the answer, given a sensor network and the recommended voltage for each of the
sensors.

Note that the table is not symmetric, i.e. assembling <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN> may be more time-consuming than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>.<P>For a sequence of components labelled <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>aba</I></SPAN>, the two possible solutions are:<UL><LI><SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>ab</I>)<I>a</I> = <I>ba</I> = <I>a</I></SPAN> with time <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>time</I>(<I>ab</I>) + <I>time</I>(<I>ba</I>) = 5 + 6 = 11</SPAN>. </LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I>(<I>ba</I>) = <I>aa</I> = <I>b</I></SPAN> with time <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>time</I>(<I>ba</I>) + <I>time</I>(<I>aa</I>) = 6 + 3 = 9</SPAN>. </LI></UL>So the result for this case would be a piece of type <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN> in <SPAN CLASS="MATH">9</SPAN> minutes (denoted <SPAN CLASS="MATH">9</SPAN><code>-</code><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>).<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of several test cases.

<P>A wizard is in a labyrinth where there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN> rooms and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I> - 1</SPAN> doors connecting some pairs of rooms in both directions, in such a way that there is always a sequence of doors one can traverse to go from a room to any other room. Additionally, there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> locks and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> keys of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> different colours (one of each) in some of the doors and rooms of the maze, respectively; each door has at most one lock, and there is at most one key placed in each room. It should be an easy matter for the wizard to bypass the lock system, were it not for the fact that he forgot his spell book, without which his wizardry is utterly useless. The wizard is currently in room <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN>, and he wants to get his spell book, located in room <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>, without taking too long. At every step he may go to an adjacent room through one of the doors. Of course, if the door is locked, he needs to be carrying the key of the same colour as the lock (unless, of course, that door has already been unlocked). The wizard can carry only one key at a time and after picking up a key it is not possible for him to drop it somewhere in the maze in order to take it again afterwards. Once a door has been unlocked, the key is thrown away since it is no longer any use.<P>Given the maze and the positions of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> keys and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> locks, determine how to reach <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN>, if possible.

<P>Just like every fall, the organizers of the Southwestern Europe Dice Simulation Contest are busy again this year. In this edition you have to simulate a 3-sided die that outputs each of three possible outcomes (which will be denoted by <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1, 2</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3</SPAN>) with a given probability, using three dice in a given set. The simulation is performed this way: you choose one of the given dice at random, roll it, and report its outcome. You are free to choose the probabilities of rolling each of the given dice, as long as each probability is strictly greater than zero. Before distributing the materials to the contestants, the organizers have to verify that it is actually possible to solve this task.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="799" HEIGHT="799" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4963.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p4963.eps}"></DIV><P>For example, in the first test case of the sample input you have to simulate a die that yields outcome <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1, 2</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3</SPAN> with probabilities <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4963.jpg ALT="$ {\frac{{3}}{{10}}}$">,<IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4963.jpg ALT="$ {\frac{{4}}{{10}}}$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4963.jpg ALT="$ {\frac{{3}}{{10}}}$"></SPAN>.

<P>According to Wikipedia, an <SPAN CLASS="textit">arithmetic progression (AP)</SPAN> is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant. For instance, the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN> is an arithmetic progression with common difference 2. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to arithmetic progression whose common difference is a non-zero integer.<P>On the other hand, a <SPAN CLASS="textit">geometric progression (GP)</SPAN> is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN> is a geometric progression with common ratio 3.

<P>Take any positive number, find the sum of the squares of its digits, repeat! You'll end up with an infinite sequence with an interesting property that we would like to investigate further. Starting with the number 5, the sequence is:<P><P></P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay">(5, 25, 29, 85, 89, 145, 42, 20, 4, 16, 37, 58,...)</DIV><P></P><P>The interesting part is in what comes after 58: <SPAN CLASS="MATH">5<SUP>2</SUP> +8<SUP>2</SUP> = 89</SPAN> which is a number that's already been seen in the sequence. In other words, after 58, the sequence will fall into the repeating cycle: 89, 145, 42, 20, 4, 16, 37, 58.<P>What's amazing is that this cycle will appear for many other numbers: 3, 18, 36, and 64 just to name a few.

Similarly, an expression written in a conjunctive normal form is a conjunct (logical and) of sub-expressions each written in a disjunctive normal form.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="259" HEIGHT="260" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4966.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4966.eps}"></DIV><P>An AND/OR tree is a tree-like graphical-representation of boolean expressions written as either conjunctive- or disjunctive-normal form.

Here's a simple graph problem: Find the shortest path from the top-middle 
vertex to the bottom-middle vertex in a given tri-graph. A tri-graph is 
an acyclic graph of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>N</I><IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/4967img1.png
 ALT="$ \ge$">2)</SPAN> rows and exactly 3 columns. Unlike regular 
graphs, the costs in a tri-graph are associated with the vertices rather 
than the edges. So, considering the example on the right with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = 4</SPAN>, 
the cost of going straight down from the top to bottom along the middle 
vertices is 7 + 13 + 3 + 6 = 29. The layout of the directional edges in 
the graph are always the same as illustrated in the figure.

<P>FIFA is considering a few changes to the wInput ay it organizes the Football World Cup. Currently, 32 teams compete for the World Title in two stages. During the first stage, known as the groups stage, the 32 teams are split evenly into 8 groups. Every team in the group plays 3 games, one against each team in their own group. Teams are then ranked within their group according to some points system. During the second (and final) stage, the top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage where eight games are played to determine eight winners who would then play four games to determine four winners, then two games to determine the two winners who would then play the final game to determine the world champion. Needless to say, for the knockout stage to work, the number of teams in that stage has to be a power of two.<P>FIFA is considering adding more groups, adding more teams to groups, and possibly changing the number of teams advancing from each group to the knockout stage. In addition, FIFA is considering having certain teams (previous champion, host country, etc.) advance to the knockout stage directly (without having to play in the groups stage.) But FIFA needs to know how many games will be played if any of these changes are applied.

<P>Welcome to Ardenia. Ardenia is a mythical land, filled with adventure and danger, dwarves and dragons, mages and rouges. And puzzles. Lots of puzzles. Actually, the love for puzzles is the most important life ingredient of the inhabitants, and the only part they have in common.<P>This month, the people of Ardenia wonder what is the distance between two line segments in three dimensional space.

<P>
The Fiery Beast and the Ice Beast are relicts of the early days of Ardenia. They live 
in their lairs and they are kept in the lairs' neighborhoods by powerful magic lines 
drawn by the Elders. These lines must not be crossed by the beasts. However, in the 
recent years some of these lines vanished. And if the beasts came too close to each 
other, the consequences for the whole human race would be catastrophic. 

<P>
You, the king of the land, are certainly worried about it and gathered all 
the information about the existing magic lines. It appears that the land 
can be treated as an infinite plane (this fact was established by Herman 
the Wise, who traveled for many days in one direction and was still able 
to see new things!) The lair of the Ice Beast is at point <!-- MATH

<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(0, 10<SUP>10</SUP>)</SPAN> and 
the lair of the Fiery Beast is at point <!-- MATH
 $(0, -10^{10})$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(0, -10<SUP>10</SUP>)</SPAN>. There are several 
magic straight infinite lines and neither Fiery nor Ice Beast can cross 
any of it. You want to know what is the minimum distance which always 
separates the beasts. 

<P>
An example is presented below. I and F denote the beasts' lairs and the 
gray regions denote the areas on which they may freely walk. Dotted 
segment corresponds to the minimum distance between these areas.

Casting spells is the least understood technique of dealing with real life. 
Actually, people find it quite hard to distinguish between a real spells 
like ``abrahellehhelleh" (used in the battles and taught at the mage 
universities) and screams like ``rachelhellabracadabra" (used by 
uneducated witches for shouting at cats). 

<P>
Finally, the research conducted at the Unheard University showed how one 
can measure the power of a word (be it a real spell or a scream). It 
appeared that it is connected with the mages' ability to pronounce words 
backwards. (Actually, some singers were burned at the stake for exactly 
the same ability, as it was perceived as demonic possession.) Namely, the 
power of a word is the length of the maximum subword of the form 
<!-- MATH
 $ww^{R}ww^{R}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ww</I><SUP>R</SUP><I>ww</I><SUP>R</SUP></SPAN> (where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I></SPAN> is an arbitrary sequence of characters and 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I><SUP>R</SUP></SPAN> is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I></SPAN> written backwards). If no such subword exists, then the 
power of the word is 0. For example, the power of <TT>abrahellehhelleh</TT> 
is 12 as it contains hellehhelleh and the power of 
<TT>rachelhellabracadabra</TT> is 0. Note that the power of a word is 
always a multiple of 4.

A part of your fortification is a line of mage towers, starting near the city and continuing to the northern woods.

(They gave you a lengthy explanation, but the only thing you understood was that it had something to do with firing energy bolts at enemy forces).<P>After some hard negotiations, it appeared that building new towers is out of question. Mages of Ardenia have agreed to demolish some of their towers, though. You may demolish arbitrary number of towers, but the mages enforced one condition: these towers have to be consecutive.<P>For example, if the heights of towers were, respectively, 5, 3, 4, 9, 2, 8, 6, 7, 1, then by demolishing towers of heights 9, 2, and 8, the longest increasing sequence of consecutive towers is 3, 4, 6, 7.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>The input contains several test cases.

Fortunately, the citizens have a dragon at their disposal (and they will not hesitate to use it). The dragon may drink the whole water from a lake in one sitting.

<P>Being a farmer in Ardenia is a tough job. We do not mean only the dry and hostile environment where they have to pasture sheep. The government (or actually the king himself) wants his people to invade foreign lands rather than to harvest theirs, and thus tries to make the lives of poor farmers as hard as possible. All difficulties start with a seemingly simple task: purchasing a piece of land, called farming parcel.<P>The whole farming territory is a huge rectangular grid consisting of square fields; a farming parcel consists of some of these fields. At the beginning a farmer buys an <SPAN CLASS="textit">initial set of fields</SPAN>; his parcel consists initially just of these fields. However, the actual farming parcel is determined with the help of string and poles, by repeating the following steps.<P><OL><LI>Stick a pole into the middle of each field from the farming parcel. </LI><LI>Surround the poles with a string, creating the smallest region enclosing all the poles. </LI><LI>The new farming parcel is the set of all fields having a non-empty intersection with this region. A field sharing just the edge or a corner with the region does not count. </LI></OL><P>Of course, the parcel may only increase by implementing the operation above, so each farmer makes sure these steps are repeated till the farming parcel does not change; we call such a parcel <SPAN CLASS="textit">final</SPAN>. An example is depicted below. The initial farming parcel consists of four fields (figure A), after one iteration it grows (figure B), and after another one it becomes final (figure C).<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="1072" HEIGHT="222" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/p4978.png ALT="\epsfbox{p4978.eps}"></DIV><P>It appears, however, that the final farming parcel would sometimes be the same even if the farmer did not buy all the initial fields but just a subset of them.

<P>Tic-tac-toe is the third most popular activity to kill a lazy afternoon in Ardenia (right after solving puzzles and insulting your neighbors). Arthum and Breece are not fans of this game, but their mother told them to play, so they sit at a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">5 <TT>x</TT> 5</SPAN> board. Both have a large pile of marbles: marbles of Arthum have an <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> written on them and that of Breece have a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>. However, as they are both two years old, they have no concept of rounds.

<P>
It is a well-known fact that all mages wear pointed hats. However, 
contrary to popular belief, mages do not sleep in them, and those of 
the Unheard University hang them on one common, very large wall before 
going to bed. Mages' hats come only in two shapes: a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">wide</SPAN> one 
and a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">narrow</SPAN> one. 

<P>
The mages go to sleep one after another (it is easily assured 
as due to a tight budget, they have only one bathroom and one towel). 
Before going to bed, the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>-th mage takes its hat and chooses an 
arbitrary position <!-- MATH
 $(x_{i}, y_{i})$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>i</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>i</SUB>)</SPAN> on the wall, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> is the 
(positive) distance from the ground. Then he hammers a nail at 
position <!-- MATH
 $(x_{i}, y_{i})$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>i</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>i</SUB>)</SPAN> and hangs his hat on this nail. 

<P>
Not surprisingly, the hats are magical, which means that they magically 
unfold to a given height. Hence, when hung, a hat looks exactly like a 
isosceles triangle of height <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>, i.e., its left and right 
edges are of equal length. Its top vertex is exactly at the nail and its 
bottom edge touches the Ã¯Â¬Â‚oor. If the hat is narrow, then the length 
of its bottom edge is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>; if it is wide, it is equal to <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>y</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>. 

<P>
All nails are provided by the university and they have nice heads which 
glow in the dark. If a nail becomes covered by a hat hung later (even 
by its boundary), its glow is no longer visible. Moreover, if a mage tries 
to hammer a nail at an already hanging hat (also even at its boundary), 
this nail and his hat are thrown away, and he himself becomes expelled 
from the university. The Chancellor of the University (apparently not 
having more important things to worry about) wants to know how the number 
of visible glowing nail heads changes in time. 

<P>
An example consisting of 7 hats is presented below. Dots correspond to 
glowing nail heads; numbers represent the order in which they are hung. 
Hats 2 and 6 are narrow, the remaining ones are wide. Mages 3 and 4 were 
expelled while trying to hang their hats (their hats were not hung). 
After mage 7 hung his hat, hats of mages 1, 2 and 7 were visible.

<P>Insulting your friends and neighbors is the Ardenia national sport. However, as every sport, it has a certain set of rules which are quite hard to learn even by natives, not to mention the tourists. First of all, the insults are single words consisting entirely of four vowels: <TT>a</TT>, <TT>e</TT>, <TT>i</TT>, and <TT>o</TT>. But not all words that consist of these letters are insults. The only two letter insults are <TT>ae</TT> and <TT>io</TT>. If words <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> are insults, then words <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I><SUB>1</SUB><I>w</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> and <TT>a</TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN><TT>e</TT> and <TT>i</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN><TT>o</TT> are insults as well. Insults are created only in such way.<P>Usually, if somebody is insulting you, then you better have a sharp response insult prepared. Obviously, most of the answers are inappropriate. For example if you hear <TT>aaeeio</TT> (meaning <SPAN CLASS="textit">you fight like a dairy farmer</SPAN>) you should not reply with <TT>aeio</TT> (<SPAN CLASS="textit">you are stupid</SPAN>). To everybody's surprise, the linguists have found out that in all the cases the most appropriate reply is the insult of the same length and alphabetically next. Thus, for the insult above, the best reply would be <TT>aaeioe</TT> (<SPAN CLASS="textit">how appropriate; you fight like a cow</SPAN>). This rule implies also the existence of so called ultimate insults, i.e., the ones for which there is no good reply. The eight letter ultimate insult is <TT>ioioioio</TT> (<SPAN CLASS="textit">your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries</SPAN>).<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>The input contains several test cases.

Ardenia is going to war! The famous and prestigious Ardenia's military 
unit consisting of 200 knights and 200 horses started to prepare for 
battles. During the preparation, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> knights and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> horses are chosen 
(the remaining ones simply stay at their barracks) and a special kind of 
mutual <SPAN  CLASS="textit">trust</SPAN> relation is established between certain knights and certain 
horses. In such case, we simply say that knight <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <SPAN  CLASS="textit">trusts</SPAN> horse <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> (and 
vice versa). One horse can trust arbitrarily many knights and one knight 
can trust arbitrarily many horses. 

<P>
For a given team of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> knights and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> horses, the trust relations 
between them determines the number of battles they are willing to fight. 
For each battle, each knight chooses a single horse he or she trusts: 
this creates an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">assignment</SPAN>. An example of 4 knights (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>, 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I><SUB>4</SUB></SPAN>) and 4 horses (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I><SUB>4</SUB></SPAN>) 
with trust relations is depicted below. There are 3 possible different 
assignments.

<P>
The assignments for two different battles have to be different (the 
knights would get bored otherwise) and all possible assignments have to 
be tried out (the knights are curious enough to test them all). They are 
pretty good at their fighting skills, which means that no knight or 
horse will be harmed during the making of the war. 

<P>
Your mages predicted that the war would consist of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> battles. Your task 
is to choose <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> knights and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> horses and establish trust relations

<P>Advanced Cave Megapolis (ACM) is a city that survives in the underground caves after the global nuclear war. The caves are connected by passages and the whole city map can be represented by a graph with caves being vertices and passages between them being nodes.<P>There is a revolution in the cave city. The whole population of the city is evenly split into <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> parties that cannot agree on the common laws that they should adopt. They had decided to split their city into <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> districts and have each district's citizens impose the laws of their liking upon themselves.<P>You are given a city map in the form of the graph and your task is to write a program that partitions this graph into <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> equally sized districts. Each district must form a connected subgraph that is represented by the subset of the graph's vertices.<P>Fortunately, the number of vertices in the graph is divisible by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> and the graph representing the city happens to be a <SPAN CLASS="textit">cactus</SPAN> -- a connected undirected graph in which every edge belongs to at most one simple cycle.

<P>The standard 52-card deck consists of 52 cards divided into 4 suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades. For each suit there are 13 ranks: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, king and ace, listed from the lowest to the highest.<P>A card is denoted by its rank (`<TT>2</TT>'<SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN> `<TT>9</TT>' for 2 <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN> 9, `<TT>T</TT>' for 10, `<TT>J</TT>' for jack, `<TT>Q</TT>' for queen, `<TT>K</TT>' for king, and `<TT>A</TT>' for ace) followed by its suit (`<TT>C</TT>' for clubs, `<TT>D</TT>' for diamonds, `<TT>H</TT>' for hearts, and `<TT>S</TT>' for spades). Cards are partially ordered by their ranks. The suit does not play a role in the cards ordering.<P>A Poker <SPAN CLASS="textit">hand</SPAN> is a set of five distinct cards. Each hand is said to have a certain <SPAN CLASS="textit">ranking</SPAN>. A hand with a higher ranking <SPAN CLASS="textit">beats</SPAN> a hand with a lower one. Two hands of the same ranking are compared using a tie-breaking rule specific for their ranking -- either one of them beats the other or they are tied.<P>The list of poker rankings is given below, from the worst ranking to the best ranking. If a hand satisfies several rankings, only the best one is considered.<P><UL><LI>High Card -- Does not fit into any ranking below. When comparing with another High Card hand, the ranks of the highest cards in the two hands are first compared. If there is a tie, the second highest cards in each hand are compared, and so on. (<SPAN CLASS="textit">Example:</SPAN> <TT>QS</TT>, <TT>JH</TT>, <TT>9C</TT>, <TT>7H</TT>, <TT>3D</TT>) </LI><LI>One Pair -- Two cards of the same rank. Pair with higher rank beats the lower pair. In case of a tie, the remaining three cards are used as tie-breakers, compared in the descending order of their ranks (as in High Card). (Example: <TT>6D</TT>, <TT>6H</TT>, <TT>QD</TT>, <TT>9H</TT>, <TT>4S</TT>) </LI><LI>Two Pairs -- Two pairs of cards of the same rank.

(<SPAN CLASS="textit">Example:</SPAN> <TT>JH</TT>, <TT>JS</TT>, <TT>TS</TT>, <TT>TD</TT>, <TT>8S</TT>) </LI><LI>Three of a Kind -- Three cards of the same rank.

(<SPAN CLASS="textit">Example:</SPAN> <TT>5S</TT>, <TT>5H</TT>, <TT>5D</TT>, <TT>JH</TT>, <TT>6D</TT>) </LI><LI>Straight -- Five cards in consecutive rank. An ace can either be accounted above a king or below a two, but not both, so wrapping is not allowed. Two straights are compared using the rank of the highest card (in the case of A, 2, 3, 4, 5, the highest card is considered to be 5). (<SPAN CLASS="textit">Example:</SPAN> <TT>QH</TT>, <TT>JC</TT>, <TT>TH</TT>, <TT>9D</TT>, <TT>8D</TT>) </LI><LI>Flush -- Five cards of the same suit.

The phrase, Â“if you have seen one, you have seen them allÂ” perfectly applies to it. The movies are made by fitting together existing set of scenes. This reduces production time, as there is hardly ever a new stunt to perform, nor the writers need to be creative in bringing out something innovative. To make the movies lengthy, the producers opt to repeat monotonous events, such as repetitive breaking of glass doors or the Â“bad guysÂ” rolling over the floor. Cutpiece is a producer who wants to use the power of computers to gain advantage in this film industry. He has a set of scenes out of which he wants to make his next movie. He plans to merge these scenes to make one complete movie. Although, mere merging of the scenes in some order would make a movie, but Cutpiece wants to minimize the length of the movie. The minimizing technique that he plans to apply relies on the fact that, scenes are so repetitive in their components that, the beginning of one and ending of another may be identical up to a certain length. Cutpiece has decided to condense these scenes so that the repetitive portions are included once in the merging process. In this problem, given a set of scenes, you will have to determine the minimum length of the movie that can be made by merging the given scenes in a particular order, condensing the repetitive portions during the merging process. Look at the explanation for sample input/output below to further clarify the condensing process.</p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Â Â  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p><h5 style='text-align:justify'><span class=StyleArial16pt><span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Input</span></span><span class=StyleArial16pt><span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

This contest requires problem submitters to submit their problems in encrypted format. But in year 2030, encryption software is not widely&nbsp;available on the Internet just to prevent terrorists from sending encrypted messages. So he wants to use a simplified encryption technique to submit his problem. He uses several 12-digit encryption keys to encrypt his messages. We would not disclose the encryption/decryption technique for safety because your next generations will be competing in World Finals by then. But Reuben also does not want to send his encryption key in a straightforward email. He wants to send a key (public) K<sub>1</sub> that will implicitly denote the actual key (private) <b>K<sub>2</sub></b>. <b>K<sub>2</sub></b> is such a <b>12</b> digit number so that <sub><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1035" type="#_x0000_t75" style='width:51pt;height:18pt' o:ole=""><v:imagedata src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/./e_files/image003.wmz o:title=""/></v:shape><![endif]--><![if !vml]><img width=68 height=24 src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/49/./e_files/image003.wmz v:shapes="_x0000_i1035"><![endif]></sub><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

For example you cannot make a quadrilateral with four rods of length 4, 5, 8 and 17 units but you can make a quadrilateral with four rods of length 2, 3, 4 and 5 units respectively. Now you have to supply n rods to the Architecture department of a University. But the University authority has asked you to make the length of the rods such that no four of them can be used to make a Quadrilateral. They are afraid that if the students can make such shapes then they will use up some of the rods in the sculptures they make. Given the value of n, what is the minimum possible length of the longest rod?

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>We the mankind have polluted the atmosphere all the time. That is why now in the year 2100 AD, people have to build cities covered with transparent glasses (Very hard glass though). This has to be done because people cannot survive in open air now and the artificial cover helps us to build an artificial atmosphere that is not polluted. But this system has not allowed us to remain 100% safe from the adverse atmosphere outside. Sometimes there are cracks in the glass cover and then people near that crack are supplied oxygen masks but not everyone in the city can be saved in that way. Whenever there is a crack in a certain part of the cover that part of the city is separated from the rest of the city with an invisible straight wall that prevents airflow from one part of the city to the other part, so the other part remains safe. But this creates another type of problem that will be explained somewhere below.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The city that we are talking about in this problem has 100 million people and they emit a lot of carbon-di-oxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). The city is circular in shape (Can be considered an exact circle). As the citizens are continuously polluting the city atmosphere, many air purification plants are placed around the city in a scattered way. These plants add oxygen and remove carbon-di-oxide from the air. But the number of plants in the city is exactly according to the requirement of the city: Not much more than the required numbers. This is because (a) The establishment cost of plants is very high (b) Too many plants reduces the CO<sub>2</sub> level of air to a very low level, which can be harmful for the trees within the city (Yes there are very few trees in the city as well). So it may happen that when the city is divided into two parts one part may have less air purification plant than necessary and the other part may have more air purification plans than necessary. In other words inconsistency is created for the construction of the walls. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

<html>A balanced number is a non-negative integer that can be balanced if a pivot is placed at some digit. More specifically, imagine each digit as a box with weight indicated by the digit. When a pivot is placed at some digit of the number, the distance from a digit to the pivot is the offset between it and the pivot. Then the torques of left part and right part can be calculated. It is balanced if they are the same. A balanced number must be balanced with the pivot at some of its digits. For example, 4139 is a balanced number with pivot fixed at 3. The torqueses are 4*2 + 1*1 = 9 and 9*1 = 9, for left part and right part, respectively. It's your job to calculate the number of balanced numbers in a given range [<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>].</p><h4>Input</h4><p>The input contains multiple test cases. The first line is the total number of cases <em>T</em> (0 < <em>T</em> &le; 30). For each case, there are two integers separated by a space in a line, <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. (0 &le; <em>x</em> &le; <em>y</em> &le; 10<sup>18</sup>).</p><h4>Output</h4><p>For each case, print the number of balanced numbers in the range [<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>] in a line.</p><h4>Sample Input</h4><pre>

<html>It is vitally important to have all the cities connected by highways in a war, but some of them are destroyed now because of the war. Furthermore, if a city is conquered, all the highways from/toward that city will be closed by the enemy, and we must repair some destroyed highways to keep other cities connected, with the minimum cost if possible.</p><p>Given the map of cities which have all the destroyed and remaining highways marked, you are supposed to tell the cost to connect other cities if each city is conquered by the enemy.</p><p><b>Input</b></p><p>The input contains multiple test cases. The first line is the total number of cases <i>T</i> (<i>T</i> &le; 10). Each case starts with a line containing 2 numbers <i>N</i> (0 &lt; <i>N</i> &le; 20000), and <i>M</i> (0 &le; <i>M</i> &le; 100000), which are the total number of cities, and the number of highways, respectively. Then <i>M</i> lines follow, each describes a highway by 4 integers:<br><i>City1 City2 Cost Status</i><br>where <i>City1</i> and <i>City2</i> are the numbers of the cities the highway connects (the cities are numbered from 1 to <i>N</i>), <i>Cost</i> (0 &lt; <i>Cost</i> &le; 20000) is the effort taken to repair that highway if necessary, and <i>Status</i> is either 0, meaning that highway is destroyed, or 1, meaning that highway is in use.</p><p>Note: It is guaranteed that the whole country was connected before the war and there is no duplicated high ways between any two cities.</p><p><b>Output</b></p><p>For each test case, output <i>N</i> lines of integers. The integer in the <i>i</i>-th line indicates the cost to keep the cities connected if the <i>i</i>-th city is conquered by the enemy.

<html>Unlike single maze, double maze requires a common sequence of commands to solve both mazes. See the figure below for a quick understanding.</p><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/p5008.jpg alt="Double Maze"/></div><p>A maze is made up of 6*6 cells. A cell can be either a hole or a square. Moreover, a cell may be surrounded by barriers. There is ONLY one start cell (with a ball) and ONLY one end cell (with a star) in a single maze. These two cells are both squares. It is possible that the start cell and the end cell are the same one. The goal of a single maze is to move the ball from the start cell to the end cell. There are four commands in total, 'L', 'D', 'R' and 'U' corresponding to moving the ball left, down, right and up one cell, respectively. The barriers may make the commands take no effect, i.e., the ball does NOT move if there is a barrier on the way. When the ball gets to a hole or outside of the maze, it fails.</p><p>A double maze is made up of two single mazes. The commands control two balls simultaneously, and the movements of two balls are according to the rules described above independently. Both balls will continue to move simultaneously if at least one of the balls has not got to the end cell. So, a ball may move out of the end cell since the other ball has not been to the target. A double maze passes when both balls get to their end cells, or fails if either of the two mazes fails. The goal of double maze is to get the shortest sequence of commands to pass. If there are multiple solutions, get the lexicographically minimum one.</p><p>To simplify the input, a cell is encoded to an integer as follows. The lowest 4 bits signal the existence of the barriers around a cell. The fifth bit indicates whether a cell is a hole or not. The sixth and seventh bits are set for the start cell and end cell. Details are listed in the following table with bits counted from lowest bit. For a barrier, both of the two adjacent cells will have the corresponding barrier bit set. Note that the first two mazes in the sample input is the encoding of two mazes in the figure above, make sure you understand the encoding right.</p><table border="1" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" cellpadding="1" align="center" style="margin-left:10px" width="250"><th>Bit</th><th>Value</th><th>Description</th><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center">1</td><td align="center">0</td><td>No barrier to the left</td></tr><tr><td align="center">1</td><td>A barrier to the left</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center">2</td><td align="center">0</td><td>No barrier to the bottom</td></tr><tr><td align="center">1</td><td>A barrier to the bottom</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center">3</td><td align="center">0</td><td>No barrier to the right</td></tr><tr><td align="center">1</td><td>A barrier to the right</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center">4</td><td align="center">0</td><td>No barrier to the up</td></tr><tr><td align="center">1</td><td>A barrier to the up</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center">5</td><td align="center">0</td><td>A hole</td></tr><tr><td align="center">1</td><td>A square</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center">6</td><td align="center">0</td><td>Not start cell</td></tr><tr><td align="center">1</td><td>A start cell</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center">7</td><td align="center">0</td><td>Not end cell</td></tr><tr><td align="center">1</td><td>An end cell</td></tr></table><h4>Input</h4><p>The first line of input gives the total number of mazes, <em>T</em> (1 < <em>T</em> &le; 20). Then follow <em>T</em> mazes. Each maze is a 6*6 matrix, representing the encoding of the original maze. There is a blank line between mazes.</p><h4>Output</h4><p>For every two consecutive mazes, you should treat them as a double maze and output the answer. So there are actually <em>T</em>-1 answers. For each double maze, output the shortest sequence of commands to pass. If there are multiple solutions, output the lexicographically minimum one. If there is no way to pass, output -1 instead.</p><h4>Sample Input</h4><pre>

<html>Josephina is a clever girl and addicted to Machine Learning recently. She pays much attention to a method called Linear Discriminant Analysis, which has many interesting properties.<p>In order to test the algorithm's efficiency, she collects many datasets. What's more, each data is divided into two parts: training data and test data. She gets the parameters of the model on training data and test the model on test data.<p>To her surprise, she finds each dataset's test error curve is just a parabolic curve. A parabolic curve corresponds to a quadratic function. In mathematics, a quadratic function is a polynomial function of the form <em>f(x) = ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c</em>. The quadratic will degrade to linear function if <em>a = 0</em>.<p><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/p5009.jpg alt="Quadric Function"/></div><p>It's very easy to calculate the minimal error if there is only one test error curve. However, there are several datasets, which means Josephina will obtain many parabolic curves. Josephina wants to get the tuned parameters that make the best performance on all datasets. So she should take all error curves into account, i.e., she has to deal with many quadric functions and make a new error definition to represent the total error. Now, she focuses on the following new function's minimal which related to multiple quadric functions.<p>The new function <em>F(x)</em> is defined as follow:<center><p><em>F(x) = max(S<sub>i</sub>(x))</em>, <i>i</i> = 1...<em>n</em>. The domain of <em>x</em> is [0, 1000]. <em>S<sub>i</sub>(x)</em> is a quadric function.</center><p>Josephina wonders the minimum of <em>F(x)</em>. Unfortunately, it's too hard for her to solve this problem. As a super programmer, can you help her?<h4>Input</h4><p>The input contains multiple test cases. The first line is the number of cases <em>T</em> (<em>T</em> < 100). Each case begins with a number <em>n</em>(<em>n</em> &le; 10000). Following <em>n</em> lines, each line contains three integers <em>a</em> (0 &le; <em>a</em> &le; 100), <em>b</em> (|<em>b</em>| &le; 5000), <em>c</em> (|<em>c</em>| &le; 5000), which mean the corresponding coefficients of a quadratic function.</p><h4>Output</h4><p>For each test case, output the answer in a line.

<html>In their spare time of training, Alice and Charles often play Jenga together. As they&#39;ve played the game together so many times, they both know each others&#39; performance as well as themselves&#39;. Now with their success rate of each move provided, can you tell in what probability each of them will win? And of course, Alice and Charles, as well as other ACM-ICPC contestants such as you, are very clever.</p><p>Jenga is a game of physical and mental skill. In Jenga, players take turns to remove a block from a tower and balance it on top, creating a taller and increasingly unstable structure as the game progresses.</p><p align="center"><img alt="Jenga" longdesc="Jenga" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/p5011a.jpg width="428" height="400"> <!-- <img alt="Jenga" longdesc="Jenga" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/p5011a.jpg width="428" height="400"> --></p><p>Jenga is played with 54 wooden blocks. Each block is three times as long as it is wide. To set up the game, the included loading tray is used to stack the initial tower which has 18 levels of three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side and perpendicular to the previous level (so, for example, if the blocks in the first level lie lengthwise north-south, the second level blocks will lie east-west).</p><p>Once the tower is built, the players take turns to move. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any level (except those mentioned later) of the tower, and placing it on the topmost level in order to complete it. The blocks in the top level, and the level below it if the top level is not completed, cannot be removed. However, if the top level is completed, the blocks in the one below it can be removed. The removed block should be placed to make the top level as same as the other levels (with no block removed). The move is successful if the tower does not fall.</p><p>The game ends when the tower falls, or no block can be removed without making the tower fall (rarely happened). And the loser is the player who made the tower fall (i.e., whose turn it was when the tower fell), or who cannot make the move.</p><p align="center"><img alt="Level" longdesc="Level" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/p5011a.jpg width="800" height="200"> <!-- <img alt="Level" longdesc="Level" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/p5011a.jpg width="800" height="200"> --></p><p>Now let&#39;s consider each level of the tower, there&#39;re only four types of valid arrangement of wooden blocks, as illustrated above. At the beginning of the game, they&#39;re all of the type <strong>A</strong> (or rotated by 90 degrees). And by removing a block from type <strong>A</strong>, one will get either type <strong>B</strong> or type <strong>C</strong> (or the mirrored equivalent of type <strong>C</strong>). No block from type <strong>B</strong> can be removed without making the tower fall. From type <strong>C</strong> we can only remove a block and result in type <strong>D</strong>. Then no block can be removed further. So there are only three types of moves: (1) <strong>A</strong> -&gt; <strong>B</strong>, (2) <strong>A</strong> -&gt; <strong>C</strong> and (3) <strong>C</strong> -&gt; <strong>D</strong>, while the removed block is added to the top level in addition.</p><p>As Alice and Charles have played Jenga so many times, their success rate of each move is very stable and can be formulated as <em><strong>P</strong></em> = <em><strong>b</strong></em> - <em><strong>d*n</strong></em>, where <em><strong>b</strong></em> is the player&#39;s base success rate of this type of move, <em><strong>d</strong></em> is the decrease of success rate for each additional level, and <em><strong>n</strong></em> is the number of levels in the tower before this move. The incomplete top level also counts as one level. For example, if the game begins with 18 levels, and both players have the same performance with <em><strong>b</strong></em> = 2.8 and <em><strong>d</strong></em> = 0.1, then <em><strong>P</strong></em> will be 1.0 for the first turn, and become 0.9 between the 2nd and the 4th turns. If <em><strong>P</strong></em> does not lie in the range [0, 1], the nearest number in the range is indicated. (E.g. when a player cannot fail the first several moves, <em><strong>P</strong></em> will be more than 1 until <em><strong>n</strong></em> is a bit larger.)</p><p><strong>Input</strong></p><p>The input file contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input file is a single integer <em><strong>T </strong></em>(<em><strong>T</strong></em> &le; 500), the number of test cases.</p><p>Each test cases begins with a line of <em><strong>n<sub>0</sub></strong></em> (3 &le; <em><strong>n<sub>0</sub></strong></em> &le; 18), the number of levels in the tower when the game starts. (When <em><strong>n</strong></em><sub>0</sub> is not 18, the rules are the same.) The second line contains 6 real numbers <em><strong>b<sub>a1</sub></strong></em>, <em><strong>d<sub>a1</sub></strong></em>, <em><strong>b<sub>a2</sub></strong></em>, <em><strong>d<sub>a2</sub></strong></em>, <em><strong>b<sub>a3</sub></strong></em>, <em><strong>d<sub>a3</sub></strong></em>, indicating Alice&#39;s base success rates and the decreases of success rates for each of the three moves: (1) <strong>A</strong> -&gt; <strong>B</strong>, (2) <strong>A</strong> -&gt; <strong>C</strong> and (3) <strong>C</strong> -&gt; <strong>D</strong>. The third line also contains 6 real numbers <em><strong>b<sub>c1</sub></strong></em>, <em><strong>d<sub>c1</sub></strong></em>, <em><strong>b<sub>c2</sub></strong></em>, <em><strong>d<sub>c2</sub></strong></em>, <em><strong>b<sub>c3</sub></strong></em>, <em><strong>d<sub>c3</sub></strong></em>, those of Charles.

<html>The princess is trapped in a magic place. In this place, there are <em>N</em> magic stones. In order to rescue the princess, you should destroy all the stones.</p><p>The <em>N</em> stones are in a straight line. We number them as <em>s<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>s<sub>2</sub></em>, ... <em>s<sub>n</sub></em> from left to right. Each stone has a magic strength <em>m<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>m<sub>2</sub></em>, ... <em>m<sub>n</sub></em>. You have a powerful skill that can do some damage to the stones. To release the skill, you should stand to the right of some stone (<em>s<sub>i</sub></em>). Then you throw a power ball towards left. Initially, this ball has a power of <em>p</em>. When it hits a stone, it will do some damage to the stone and its power will be decreased, and the ball will continue to fly left to the next stone if its power is still positive. Formally, if you stand to the right of <em>s<sub>i</sub></em> and the power ball's initial power is <em>p</em>, then the ball will do Max(0, <em>p</em> - (<em>i</em> - <em>j</em>) * (<em>i</em> - <em>j</em>)) damage to <em>s<sub>j</sub></em>, for each <em>j</em> <= <em>i</em>.
So from this formula, we can see that the damage to stone <em>s<sub>j</sub></em> is only
determined by the initial power of the ball and the number of stones between <em>s<sub>i</sub></em> and <em>s<sub>j</sub></em>.
</p>
<p>
A stone is destroyed if the accumulated damage you do is larger than its magic strength. Note that even if
a stone is destroyed, it will not disappear; your magic ball will do damage to it and
the power will be decreased by that stone. You are not strong enough so that you can release
at most <em>k</em> magic balls. It will cost a lot of energy if the power of the magic ball is too high.
So what is the minimum value of <em>p</em> with which you can destroy all the magic stones,
with no more than <em>k</em> magic balls? You can choose where to release each magic ball as your will,
and the power of the ball <strong>must be a positive integer</strong>.

<html>When we were children, we were always asked to do the classification homework. For example, we were given words {Tiger, Panda, Potato, Dog, Tomato, Pea, Apple, Pear, Orange, Mango} and we were required to classify these words into three groups. As you know, the correct classification was {Tiger, Panda, Dog}, {Potato, Tomato, Pea} and {Apple, Pear, Orange, Mango}. We can represent this classification with a mapping sequence {A,A,B,A,B,B,C,C,C,C}, and it means Tiger, Panda, Dog belong to group A, Potato, Tomato, Pea are in the group B, and Apple, Pear, Orange, Mango are in the group C.<p>But the <b>LABEL</b> of group doesn't make sense and the <b>LABEL</b> is just used to indicate different groups. So the representations {P,P,O,P,O,O,Q,Q,Q,Q} and {E,E,F,E,F,F,W,W,W,W} are equivalent to the original mapping sequence. However, the representations {A,A,A,A,B,B,C,C,C,C} and {D,D,D,D,D,D,G,G,G,G} are not equivalent.<p><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/p5013.jpg alt="Similarity"/></div><p>The pupils in class submit their mapping sequences and the teacher should read and grade the homework. The teacher grades the homework by calculating the maximum similarity between pupils' mapping sequences and the answer sequence. The definition of similarity is as follow.<p><center><p>Similarity(S, T) = sum(S<sub>i</sub> == T<sub>i</sub>) / L<p>L = Length(S) = Length(T), i = 1, 2,... L, where sum(S<sub>i</sub> == T<sub>i</sub>) indicates the total number of equal labels in corresponding positions.</center><p>The maximum similarity means the maximum similarities between S and all equivalent sequences of T, where S is the answer and fixed.<p>Now given all sequences submitted by pupils and the answer sequence, you should calculate the sequences' maximum similarity.<h4>Input</h4><p>The input contains multiple test cases. The first line is the total number of cases <em>T</em> (<em>T</em> < 15). The following are <em>T</em> blocks. Each block indicates a case. A case begins with three numbers <em>n</em> (0 < <em>n</em> < 10000), <em>k</em> (0 < <em>k</em> < 27), <em>m</em> (0 < <em>m</em> < 30), which are the total number of objects, groups, and students in the class. The next line consists of <em>n</em> labels and each label is in the range [<em>A</em>...<em>Z</em>]. You can assume that the number of different labels in the sequence is exactly <em>k</em>. This sequence represents the answer. The following are <em>m</em> lines, each line contains <em>n</em> labels and each label also is in the range [<em>A</em>...<em>Z</em>]. These <em>m</em> lines represent the <em>m</em> pupils' answer sequences. You can assume that the number of different labels in each sequence doesn't exceed <em>k</em>.</p><h4>Output</h4><p>For each test case, output <em>m</em> lines, each line is a floating number (Round to 4 digits after the decimal point). You should output the <em>m</em> answers in the order of the sequences appearance.</p><h4>Sample Input</h4><pre>

<html>Snooker is a cue sport that is played on a large baize-covered table with pockets in each of the four corners and in the middle of each of the long side cushions. It is played using a cue and snooker balls: one white cue ball, 15 red balls worth one point each, and six balls of different colors: yellow (2 points), green (3), brown (4), blue (5), pink (6) and black (7). A player (or team) wins a frame (individual game) of snooker by scoring more points than the opponent(s), using the cue ball to pot the red and colored balls.</p><p>In this problem, your job is the referee of snooker. You should score both players, ask the correct player to play next, as well as place some of the balls back to the table if necessary. The rules of snooker needed for this problem are following. (We ignore some fouls about incorrectly hitting the cue ball here. We assume that the cue ball is never snookered after a foul, so <em>free ball</em> will never occur. We also assume that both players will make their best attempts to hit the ball on, so you do not need to declare a <em>miss</em> when they do not hit the ball on first.)</p><p align="center"><!-- <img alt="Snooker" longdesc="Snooker" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/snooker_referee_1.png width="720" height="379"> --><img alt="Snooker" longdesc="Snooker" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/snooker_referee_1.png width="720" height="379"></p><p>At the beginning of each frame the balls are set up by the referee as illustrated above. This will be followed by a <em>break-off shot</em>, the white cue ball can be placed anywhere inside the D (it is called <em>in-hand</em>, which also happens when the cue ball is potted).</p><p>Players take turns in visiting the table. A <em>break</em> is the number of points scored by a player in one single visit to the table. A player&#39;s turn and break end when he fails to pot a ball, when he does something against the rules of the game, which is called a <em>foul</em>, or when a frame has ended.</p><p>The ball or balls that can be hit first by the white are called the ball(s) &quot;on&quot; for that particular stroke. The ball(s) &quot;on&quot; differ from shot to shot: a red ball, if potted, must be followed by a color, and so on until a break ends; if a red is not potted, any red ball remains the ball &quot;on&quot;. Only a ball or balls &quot;on&quot; may be potted legally by a player. If a ball not &quot;on&quot; is potted, this is a foul.</p><p>The game of snooker generally consists of two phases. The first phase is the situation in which there are still red balls on the table. In the first phase, at the beginning of a player&#39;s turn, the balls &quot;on&quot; are all remaining red balls. The player must therefore attempt to first hit and pot one or more red balls. For every red ball potted, the player will receive 1 point. When a red has been potted, it will stay off the table and the player can continue his break. If no red has been potted or a foul has been made, the other player will come into play.</p><p>In case one or more red balls have been potted, the player can continue his break. This time one of the six colors (yellow, green, brown, blue, pink and black) is the ball &quot;on&quot;. Only one of these can be the ball &quot;on&quot; and the rules of the game state that a player must nominate his desired color to the referee, although it is often clear which ball the striker is playing and it is not necessary to nominate.</p><p>When the nominated color is potted, the player will be awarded the correct number of points (yellow, 2; green, 3; brown, 4; blue, 5; pink, 6; black, 7). The color is then taken out of the pocket by the referee and placed on its original spot.</p><p>Because only one of the colors is the ball &quot;on&quot;, it is a foul to first hit multiple colors at the same time, or pot more than one color.</p><p>If a player fails to pot a ball &quot;on&quot;, it being a red or nominated color, the other player will come into play and the balls &quot;on&quot; are always the reds, as long as there are still reds on the table.</p><p>The alternation between red balls and colors ends when all reds have been potted and a color is potted after the last red, or a failed attempt to do so is made. Then the second phase begins. All six colors have to be potted in ascending order of their points value (yellow, green, brown, blue, pink, black). Each becomes the ball &quot;on&quot; in that order. During this phase, when potted, the colors stay down and are not replaced on the table, unless a foul is made when potting the color, in which case the color is respotted.</p><p>When only the black is left, the first score or foul ends the frame, and the player who has scored most points has won it. However, if the score is tied after that, the black is respotted, the players draw lots for choice of playing, the next player plays from in-hand, and the next score or foul ends the frame.</p><p>When a foul is made during a shot, the player&#39;s turn is ended and he will receive no points for the foul shot. The other player will receive penalty points. Colors illegally potted are respotted (while reds are not), and if the cue ball is potted, the next player will play from in-hand. Fouls concerned in this problem are:</p><ul><li>failing to hit any other ball with the cue ball</li> <li>first hitting a ball &quot;not-on&quot; with the cue ball</li> <li>potting a ball &quot;not-on&quot;</li> <li>potting the white (in-off)</li></ul><p>Penalty points are at least 4 points and at most 7 points. The number of penalty points is the value of the ball &quot;on&quot;, or any of the &quot;foul&quot; balls, whichever is highest. When more than one foul is made, the penalty is not the added total - only the most highly valued foul is counted. As players usually do not nominate a color explicitly when hitting the colors, please be tolerant and assume that he always nominate the ball with the lowest score when it cannot be deduced from the ball first hit (i.e. when the cue ball does not hit any ball or hit a red first).</p><p>If a player commits a foul, and his opponent considers that the position left is unattractive, he may request that the offender play again from the resulting position.</p><p><strong>Input</strong></p><p>The input file contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input file is a single integer <em><strong>T</strong></em> (<em><strong>T</strong></em> &le; 200), the number of test cases.</p><p>For each test case (frame), the first line contains the names of the two players separated by a whitespace. The first player will take the break-off shot. Each name is made up of no more than 20 English letters, and the two names are different.</p><p>After that, the input mainly consists of lines that describe a stroke each (with two exceptions stated later). A stroke is described by the color of the ball first hit by the cue ball (or &quot;None&quot; if the cue ball does not hit any ball), followed by zero or more colors of the balls potted, all separated by whitespaces. For example, a line &quot;Red Red White Red&quot; means the cue ball first hit a red ball, and 2 reds are potted as well as the cue ball itself; and a line &quot;None&quot; means the cue ball does not hit any ball thus no ball is potted. You can assume that all strokes are legal according to the balls remain on the table, and the cue ball will not hit two or more ball first simultaneously.</p><p>A line &quot;Play again&quot; may appear if and only if the last stroke is a foul. It means the other player request that the offender play again from the resulting position.</p><p>If a score or foul occurs when only the black is left, and the score is tied after that, a line with either player&#39;s name will follow. That means the player will play next as a result of the lot.</p><p>The case end when the frame ends. There is a blank line before every test case.</p><p><strong>Output</strong></p><p>For each frame, print a line in the format &quot;Frame <em>K</em>&quot; first, where <em>K</em> is the index of this case starts from 1. Then use the output to indicate the referee&#39;s behaviors:</p><ul><li><p>When a frame begins, print a line in the format &quot;<em>PlayerName</em>&#39;s turn, in-hand&quot;, where <em>PlayerName</em> is the name of the player who take the break-off shot.</p></li><li><p>After each stroke, print a line &quot;Foul!&quot; first if it is a foul. Then print a line with current score in the format &quot;<em>ScoreA</em> : <em>ScoreB</em>&quot;, where <em>ScoreA</em> is the score of the player who take the break-off shot, and <em>ScoreB</em> is the other player&#39;s score.</p><p>After that, if the frame continue fairly (i.e. not only black is left before the stroke, or it is not a score or foul when only black is left), and some ball(s) should be respotted. Print a line with the word &quot;Respot&quot; following by the color(s) of the ball(s), all separated by whitespace. If more than one ball should be respotted, print their colors in ascending order of their values. Do not print anything if no ball needed to be respotted.</p><p>At last (when the frame continue fairly and any necessary ball has been respotted), if the last player&#39;s break ends, print a line in the format &quot;<em>PlayerName</em>&#39;s turn&quot; to ask the other player to play next, where <em>PlayerName</em> is the next player&#39;s name. If the next player should play from in-hand, print &quot;<em>PlayerName</em>&#39;s turn, in-hand&quot; instead.</p></li><li><p>After a foul, if the other player request that the offender play again, just print a line &quot;<em>PlayerName</em>&#39;s turn&quot; or &quot;<em>PlayerName</em>&#39;s turn, in-hand&quot; according to whether the cue ball is in-hand, where <em>PlayerName</em> is the offender&#39;s name. Note that the requester is actually requesting in his turn, after you asked him to play next.</p></li><li><p>If a score or foul occurs when only the black is left, and the score is tied after that, print a line &quot;Tie&quot; after the score. Then print two lines &quot;Respot Black&quot; and &quot;<em>PlayerName</em>&#39;s turn, in-hand&quot; to respot the black and play from in-hand, where <em>PlayerName</em> is the next player&#39;s name (determined by the lot).</p></li><li><p>When the frame ends, print a line &quot;<em>PlayerName</em> wins&quot; after the score, where <em>PlayerName</em> is the winner&#39;s name.</p></li></ul><p>Print a blank line between every two successive cases.</p><p><strong>Sample Input</strong></p><pre>1

<P>Your country has qualified for the FIFA 2010 South Africa World Cup. As the coach, you have made up the 23 men squad. Now you must select 11 of them as the starters.

<P>Jimmy invents an interesting card game. There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> cards, each of which contains a string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>. Jimmy wants to stick them into several circles, and each card belongs to one circle exactly. When sticking two cards, Jimmy will get a score. The score of sticking two cards is the longest common prefix of the second card and the reverse of the first card. For example, if Jimmy sticks the card <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> containing ``<TT>abcd</TT>" in front of the card <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> containing ``<TT>dcab</TT>", the score is 2. And if Jimmy sticks <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> in front of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>, the score is 0. The card can also stick to itself to form a self-circle, whose score is 0.<P>For example, there are 3 cards, whose strings are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>=``<TT>ab</TT>", <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>=``<TT>bcc</TT>", <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN>=``<TT>ccb</TT>".

<P>All the big malls need a powerful system for the products retrieval. Now you are employed design a sub-system: reading the barcodes and return the matching products.<P>A barcode is an optical machine-readable representation of data, which shows certain data on certain products. A barcode consists of a series of bars with different widths. In our system, the barcodes have been scanned and the widths have been recorded. Every consecutive eight bars are considered as representing the ASCII code of a character, each bar for each bit. Ideally, there should be only two kinds of widths in the eight bars, and the width of the wider bar is twice of the narrower. The wider bar indicates 1, while the narrower indicates 0. However, due to the inaccuracy of printing and scanning, there will be an error of at most 5%. That is, if the pretended exact width is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>, you may get a value in the range <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[0.95<I>x</I>, 1.05<I>x</I>]</SPAN>.<P>For example, the width sequence ``10.0 20.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 20.0" is a valid barcode of our system, and it means <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(01000001)<SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>, which is <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(65)<SUB>10</SUB></SPAN> and the corresponding character is ``A".

<P>
Do you know the ``Happy Farm"? It is a very popular webpage game. The 
player plays the role of the farmer, who can plant vegetables or grow 
kinds of flowers at his farm. When vegetables or flowers become ripe, 
the player can get in them in order to make some money. However, the 
greatest part of the game is to steal other farmers' vegetables and 
flowers. The owner of the farm can keep a dog to help him guard 
against theft. Now, Farmer John intends to steal something when his 
neighbor David isn't online. Unfortunately, David keeps a dog. Can 
you work out a best plan for John? 

<P>
Let's suppose that David has planted <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> vegetables. The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>-th 
vegetable's value is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>. Meanwhile, stealing the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>-th vegetable 
increases <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> anger value of the dog. Due to the Internet and 
computer conditions, stealing the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>-th vegetable will lead to an initial 
time delay of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>. On the condition that we do not refresh the 
webpage, if you choose to steal the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>-th vegetable in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN>-th turn, 
the actual time delay is <!-- MATH
 $j \ast d_{i}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I> <TT>*</TT> <I>d</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>. Now, John wants to steal all 
of the vegetables. He can turn the dog's anger value into zero and 
restart to count the number of delays by refreshing the webpage. 
Please pay attention that the value of the vegetable you are stealing 
now must be less than the value of any other vegetable that you have 
stolen before. It takes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I></SPAN> units of time to refresh the webpage and 
the game allows you to refresh the webpage for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> times at most. 

<P>
During the whole theft, John wants to keep the maximum anger value of 
the dog at the lowest level. Meanwhile, the total time it takes cannot 
be longer than t units. Can you work out a plan?

Traveling through hyperspace is a risky thing, considering the fact that 
there are many stars, asteroids, (and possibly black holes!) out in the 
galaxy, and without careful planning, it's so easy to end up thousands 
of light-years from your planned destination. Therefore people who don't 
like uncertainty tend to avoid hyperspace traveling. However, as we need 
to travel through an unknown sector to attend the ACM/ICPC world final 
in the year 3007, and you're the most experienced navigator and programmer 
we can find, it is unfortunately your responsibility to plan a journey 
that will lead us across the sector. 

<P>
It is know that there are several strange asteroids in the sector - every 
one of them is generating gravity anomaly in a circular area with a fixed 
radius around the asteroid. One particular position's abnormality value 
is equal to the number of asteroids affecting that position. 

<P>
You decided that you will follow one simple rule during your travel - that 
is, you will always fly your ship along the gravity range boundary of one 
or more asteroids. Nevertheless, the possibility of failure remains due 
to the unpredictable nature of gravity anomaly, therefore you also want 
to minimize the absolute difference between the maximum abnormality 
value and the minimum abnormality value on your flight path. For 
simplicity, you can assume that all asteroids (as well as your 
flight path) will be on the plane Z = 0. Can you find the minimum 
absolute value with the help of your computer?

<P>
The floor of Gholam's bedroom is tiled with white and yellow tiles Sometime 
when he is bored, he stands on one of the tiles and starts to walk along 
the row he is standing on. He first decides on a number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> and starts to 
walk <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> steps. If he reaches the wall, he turns back and continues to walk 
in the opposite direction. He continues until he takes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> steps. Note 
that turning back besides a wall does not count as a step. He counts how 
many yellow tiles he steps on. 

<P>
For example, the figure below shows a row in the floor. The colors 
of the tiles are shown with the characters `Y' and `W' for yellow and 
white tiles respectively. If he starts at tille 3 facing to the right, 
and decides to take 7 steps, he finally stops a tile 2. During this 
walk, he steps 3 times on yellow tiles.

<P>Drop7 is a single-player game played on a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">7 <TT>x</TT> 7</SPAN> vertical grid. Initially, the grid is empty. In each turn, you will be given a disc on which a number between 1 and 7 is written and you have to drop it into one of the 7 column from the above. It falls down the <SPAN CLASS="MATH">7</SPAN>-th row of the selected column, until it reaches above an already occupied cell or touches the ground in the first (bottom) row. For example, in Figure 1, dropping the disc into the first (leftmost) column causes it to stand in the second row (avobe 6) and dropping it into the third column causes it to hit the ground and to stay in the first row.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="385" HEIGHT="434" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/p5048a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p5048a.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1</DIV><P>After dropping the given disc in a turn, each disc having a number equal to the size of its group-row or group-column will disappear (we will shortly define group-row a group-column). We know that all the discs that are subject to disappear will fade simultaneously. After that, all discs that the disc below them has been disappeared will fall down as far as possible. Then, the disappearance condition will be checked again on all the available discs again and if some disc number matches their group-row/column size, the loop continues. Otherwise, the next turn comes and a new disc will be dropped.<P><P><BR>The group-column of a disc is the number of discs that are already placed in the same column, including itself. For example, if we drop the disc 3 into the first column (as in Figure 1), its group-colum will have the size of 2 and nothing happens. But, if we drop it into the <SPAN CLASS="MATH">4</SPAN>-th column from the left, the disc will disappear (because the group-column consists of three of discs, 7, 7, and 3). Interestingly, if we drop this disc over the <SPAN CLASS="MATH">7</SPAN>-th (rightmost) column, not only the disc itself will disappear, but also the other 3 will disappear at the same time! More interestingly, if we drop this disc on the <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2</SPAN>-nd column, two discs will be removed in two steps - first the disc 4 will disappear as the column size (after putting 3 over it) will be 4. Then, after removal of 4, disc 3 will fall down over the two fives and then disappears by the same rule of matching number with group-column size.<P>Group-row size of a disc, however, is the number of discs connectedly in the same row of the disc. For example, in Figure 2, if we drop disc 1 into the second column, the group-row size of it, besides the 5 in the first column, would be two. But if we drop it into the last column, the group-row size of both of 3's will become 3 and they both will disappear at the same time. Then the disc 1 will have group-row size of 1 and will disappear by itself!<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="372" HEIGHT="417" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/p5048a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p5048b.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 2</DIV><P>Starting with an empty board, you will be given some disc-drop actions.

<P>A Seven Segment Display is generally a form for representing decimals numbers 0 to 9, using exactly 7 segments. You may have already seen such displays on price-list boards, like in exchange offices or fuel stations. Using three of these displays together, with a proper underlying electronic circuit, one can create a three digit display to show number between 0 and 999 (inclusive), without leading zero. Our man, Shelby, has already done this! Going further he has even made it to work as a time counter - As each second passes the number in display advances by one and when reaching 999, the next number is 0 (i.e. it works as a cyclic counter).<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="404" HEIGHT="240" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/p5049a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p5049a.eps}"></DIV><P>Shelby is a technician in a company. There is one of those three-digit seven segment display (working as a counter) hanging on Shelby's office wall. Shelby is asked to write the displaying number of the counter on a piece of paper, everyday at 15:00:00 that is the time he leaves the company. It has some security reasons and is requested by the big boss!<P>Unfortunately, yesterday Shelby forgot to write the number and he is too anxious now! As a matter of luck he has found some images taken by various surveillance cameras taken at 15:00:00 or later. But the problem is that, the state (either on or off) of some of the 21 segments (in three seven segments) are not visible in the photos clearly!<P>Given the photos, each containing information about those 21 segments (either visible and on, or visible and off, or not-visible in this certain photo), and the time the photos is taken, you are asked to help Shelby to find out the number of the counter at 15:00:00.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of several test cases, each containing some photos (at least one and at most 20).

<P>Killbots is a simple game of evading killer robots. Who created the robots and why they have been programmed to destroy, no one knows. All that is know is that the robots are numerous and their sole objective is to destroy everything on their way. Fortunately, their creator focused on quantity rather than quality and as a result the robots are severely lacking in intelligence. Killbots is a turn-based game, played on a rectangular <SPAN CLASS="textit">grid</SPAN>. Each cell can contain one of the following:<P><DL><DT><STRONG><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Hero</SPAN> (<code>@</code>)</STRONG></DT><DD>- The hero is the unfortunate soul stuck in a room with a bunch of killler robots. In the original Killbots game, the player controls the hero by moving it around the grid. But in this problem, it is assumed that the hero stays at his place and does not move at all. Instead, it can destroy any robot trying to come to its cell.</DD><DT><STRONG><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Robot</SPAN> (<code>+</code>)</STRONG></DT><DD>- Robots are mechanical thugs desiring on to crush the hero with the metallic girth. They have never heard of the ``Three Laws of Robotics" and would probably crush anyone who tried to explain them. Each robot will take a single step toward the hero on every turn. If the robot is in the same row or the same column as the hero, it will step directly towards the robot. Otherwise, it will take the diagonal step that makes it as closer to the hero.</DD><DT><STRONG><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Fastbot</SPAN> (<TT>#</TT>)</STRONG></DT><DD>- <SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Fastbots</SPAN></SPAN> are a much speedier version of the basic robot. For each move a robot makes, they take two steps. Fortunately, their increased mobility was not paired with increased intelligence; they often only succeed in destroying themselves twice as quickly as their slower brethren.</DD><DT><STRONG><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Junkheap</SPAN> (<code>*</code>)</STRONG></DT><DD>- When two or more robot or fastbots collide, they are destroyed and the resulting debris produces a junkheap. Robots or fastbots blindly ignore any junkheaps in their path and are destroyed upon crashing into them.</DD></DL><P><P><BR>The following figure is an example of how the game works. The cell E5 is where the hero stands. The cells containing junkheap are marked with `<code>*</code>'. Robots and fastbots are shown with `<code>+</code>' and `<code>#</code>' respectively. If we start from the grid on the left, the robots at B5 an E4 take direct steps directly towards the hero (to the right and down respectively). The latter is destroyed by the hero. The one at B8 takes an up-right step to C7. The robot at H6 takes an up-left step to G5 where it crashes into junkheap and is destroyed. The robot at F7 toes to E6 (where it will be destroyed in the next step by the fastbot initially at G8. Note that all robots and fastbots move simultaneously so at the same time F7 moves to E6, the fastbot at G8 move to F7, without collision. After a turn that all robots a fastbots move, the fastbots move another step while the robots stay. So, the fastbot at F7 moves to E6 crashing into the robot staying there. They are both destroyed leaving junkheap at E6. The game continue until all robots and fastbots are destroyed either by the hero, or crashing into other robots or junkheap.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="750" HEIGHT="314" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/p5054.png ALT="\epsfbox{p5054.eps}"></DIV><P>The goal of this problem is count the number of robots and fastbots destroyed by the hero.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>There are multiple test-case in the input each specifying a game grid.

<P>Flatland is a 2-dimensional world in which some creatures have an odd miserable life. Despite the many handicaps, the poor creatures have recently achieved the wireless technology in Flatland. So, the priest circles (governors of Flatland who kill the apostles of 3D as soon as they see one) created the national motto ``<SPAN CLASS="textit">Wireless technology is our indisputable right!</SPAN>" and organized a wireless spreading committee for connecting all important points of the Flatland by wireless antennas.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="363" HEIGHT="188" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/p5055a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p5055a.eps}"></DIV><P>Everything went well until the committee reached the mountainous region of Flatland. This region can be modeled with a horizontal <SPAN CLASS="textit">base line</SPAN> covered by a contiguous serie of mountain. Each mountain is a right-angled isosceles triangle with its base on the <SPAN CLASS="textit">base line</SPAN> and its right angle as the peak. Currently, there are only two types of mountains in this region: those with a height of 50, and those with a height of 100. You can see a sample of the mountainous region in the figure below.<P>The wireless spreading comitte first installed their antennas on the points they had already planned for the mountainous region. But in the end, they found out that a pair of antennas could directly communicate only if the line segment connecting the two antennas had no crossing intersection with any obstacles -- specifically the mountains here. Note that two antennas <SPAN CLASS="textit">can</SPAN> communicate if <SPAN CLASS="textit">only the border</SPAN> of obstacles is on their connecting line segment.<P>Since removing a wireless antenna in Flatland is nowadays as a deadly sin as ``chromatization'', the only way to connect the set of already installed antennas is to install some extra antennas on the appropriate points of the mountains! Wireless antennas can generally relay the messages and connect to ones which cannot communicate directly. In order to reduce the expenses of installing extra antennas, the wireless spreading committee has hired you to find the minimum number of antennas needed to install.<P>For example, consider the 4 diamond-shaped points in the figure below as the place of the wireless antennas already installed on the mountains.

<P>In the history of Asia there is an ancient empire called Mayo which was one of the most powerful countries of its own time. At first the empire consisted of only one city (which was the capital) but its people were great warriors so they started to invade their neighbors and increase the area of their lands.<P>Each time they defeated a neighbor, the razed all their cities except the biggest one, which is added to their kingdom. They built a road from that city to one of their own cities, so that they could travel between all cities of their lands. If the added city was big enough it would become the capital of Mayo.<P>The vulnerability of a city in Mayo was defined the number of roads that one had to pass to travel from that city to the capital of Mayo.

<P>Two pandas A and B like each other.

<P>
The city of Thunder has many houses and they are powered by lightning. Two houses may be 
interconnected by a wire. The wires connect the houses such that there is exactly one 
path from one house to any other house in the city. Each house has a large battery that 
can store infinite electrical energy. 

<P>
Everyday, several lightnings strike several houses. 
These lightnings are very unusual, when it strikes, it strikes two houses simultaneously: 
one house (A) with a red lightning and the other house (B) with a blue lightning. After 
the strikes, every house along the path from A to B (inclusive) will receive a certain 
amount of electrical energy which is then added to the house's battery. 

<P>
The mayor of Thunder city wants a report on the stored electrical energy for every house at 
the end of the month and the owner of each house has to pay taxes for that. To prevent the 
owners report invalid energy stored in their house battery (because they want less tax to 
pay), you are asked to produce a correct report based on the observed lightnings of the 
current month. At the beginning of the month, the energy reading on the battery of each 
house is 0.

In almost all ICPC trainings, one of the basic items to be taught (or even better, assumed) 
is how to compute the transitive closure of a directed graph. Since this concept is so 
elementary, there is a professor that suggests to solve this problem using Warshall's 
algorithm. As one of the bonus tasks of this ICPC, we would like to examine whether the 
participants have indeed mastered this technique.

<P>
In the factory of ACM Computerized Manufacturing Ltd. (ACM Ltd.), items are manufactured 
in assembly lines and are given imprinted serial numbers to distinguish them from one 
another. The serial numbers are generated by a special kind of simplistic multi-function 
counter machine which generates serial number sequentially in increasing order (1, 2, 3, 
and so on). 

<P>
As the counter machine has multiple functions embedded in its simple design, 
some substrings are reserved as op-codes command which must not be presented in the 
machine's serial number output. For example if 23 is a command op-code, then 23 must not 
be presented in the substring of a serial number -- assuming there is no other command op-code, 
the number sequence would go like this: 1, 2, 3, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN>, 21, 22, 24, 25, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN>, 121, 
122, 124, 125, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN>, 228, 229, 240, 241, 242, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN>. 

<P>
This result in serial number that is different from the actual production batch number 
recorded in the system. The system does not map the relationship between both numbers 
and/or record exact serial numbers for each item, this may cause problems when an individual 
item needs to be tracked (e.g. for a recall or inspection). Given the production batch 
number of an item, your task is to determine the serial number for that item.

Wibowo and his girlfriend are playing with a deck of card. A deck consists of 52 different 
cards. Each card has a number (from lowest to highest: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, 
Queen, King, Ace) and a suit (from weakest to strongest: Diamond, Club, Heart, Spade). 
When two cards are compared, the one with higher number is considered win. If they have 
the same number then the stronger suit will win. 

<P>
First, Wibowo and his girlfriend split the deck so each one get 26 cards. The game consists 
of 26 rounds. In each round, both Wibowo and his girlfriend pick one card from their hand 
at the same time and compare it. The winner get one point for that round. 

<P>
Given the initial hand, Wibowo wondered what is the highest point he could possibly get by 
playing that hand with his girlfriend.

<P>Joko is taking part in a fire drill which is held by the Jakarta Fire Department to recruit new firemen. The drill is about rescuing volunteers (who act as unconscious people) trapped in a building in a limited time. The building has several floors, and the volunteers are scattered throughout the building. Each volunteer has points assigned to her. The fireman candidate should rescue volunteers through carrying them to the exit. The candidate will earn the assigned points for each volunteer he rescued.<P>Each floor of a building can be seen as a grid of cells. Each cell can be an obstacle, an empty space, a stair or an entry/exit point.<P>A candidate starts at the entry point which exists only at one single cell of the first floor of the building. The candidate can move to any adjacent non-obstacle cells (north, south, west or east) or climb up or down a stair in 1 second. The movement slows down to 2 seconds when the candidate carries a volunteer. When a candidate finds a volunteer, he may decide to rescue her or not, but if he decides to rescue her, he has to carry her back to the exit without stopping. He can only carry at most one volunteer at a time.<P>Joko has the floor plan of the test building.

``Balloons should be captured efficiently", the game designer says. He is designing an oldfashioned game with two dimensional graphics. 
In the game, balloons fall onto the ground one after another, and the player manipulates a robot vehicle on the ground to capture the 
balloons. The player can control the vehicle to move left or right, or simply stay. When one of the balloons reaches the ground, 
the vehicle and the balloon must reside at the same position, otherwise the balloon will burst and the game ends.

</DIV>

<P>
The goal of the game is to store all the balloons into the house at the left end 
on the game field. The vehicle can carry at most three balloons at a time, but its speed changes according to the number of the 
carrying balloons. When the vehicle carries <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> balloons (<!-- MATH
 $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> = 0, 1, 2, 3</SPAN>), it takes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> + 1</SPAN> units of time to move one unit distance. 
The player will get higher score when the total moving distance of the vehicle is shorter. 

<P>
Your mission is to help the game 
designer check game data consisting of a set of balloons. Given a landing position (as the distance from the house) and a 
landing time of each balloon, you must judge whether a player can capture all the balloons, and answer the minimum moving 
distance needed to capture and store all the balloons. The vehicle starts from the house. If the player cannot capture all 
the balloons, you must identify the first balloon that the player cannot capture.

<P>You are working as a night watchman in an office building. Your task is to check whether all the lights in the building are turned off after all the office workers in the building have left the office. If there are lights that are turned on, you must turn off those lights. This task is not as easy as it sounds to be because of the strange behavior of the lighting system of the building as described below. Although an electrical engineer checked the lighting system carefully, he could not determine the cause of this behavior. So you have no option but to continue to rely on this system for the time being.<P>Each floor in the building consists of a grid of square rooms. Every room is equipped with one light and one toggle switch. A toggle switch has two positions but they do not mean fixed ON/OFF. When the position of the toggle switch of a room is changed to the other position, in addition to that room, the ON/OFF states of the lights of the rooms at a certain Manhattan distance from that room are reversed. The Manhattan distance between the room at <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>1</SUB>)</SPAN> of a grid of rooms and the room at <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>2</SUB>)</SPAN> is given by <SPAN CLASS="MATH">| <I>x</I>1 - <I>x</I>2| + | <I>y</I>1 - <I>y</I>2|</SPAN>. For example, if the position of the toggle switch of the room at (2, 2) of a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">4 <TT>x</TT> 4</SPAN> grid of rooms is changed and the given Manhattan distance is two, the ON/OFF states of the lights of the rooms at (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), and (4, 2) as well as at (2, 2) are reversed as shown in Figure D.1, where black and white squares represent the ON/OFF states of the lights.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="377" HEIGHT="166" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/p5070.png ALT="\epsfbox{p5070.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure D.1: An example behavior of the lighting system</DIV><P>Your mission is to write a program that answer whether all the lights on a floor can be turned off.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input is a sequence of datasets.

<P>Two experienced climbers are planning a first-ever attempt: they start at two points of the equal altitudes on a mountain range, move back and forth on a single route keeping their altitudes equal, and finally meet with each other at a point on the route. A wise man told them that if a route has no point lower than the start points (of the equal altitudes) there is at least a way to achieve the attempt. This is the reason why the two climbers dare to start planning this fancy attempt.<P>The two climbers already obtained altimeters (devices that indicate altitude) and communication devices that are needed for keeping their altitudes equal. They also picked up a candidate route for the attempt: the route consists of consequent line segments without branches; the two starting points are at the two ends of the route; there is no point lower than the two starting points of the equal altitudes. An illustration of the route is given in Figure E.1 (this figure corresponds to the first dataset of the sample input).<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="863" HEIGHT="411" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/p5071.png ALT="\epsfbox{p5071.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure E.1: An illustration of a route</DIV><P>The attempt should be possible for the route as the wise man said. The two climbers, however, could not find a pair of move sequences to achieve the attempt, because they cannot keep their altitudes equal without a complex combination of both forward and backward moves. For example, for the route illustrated above: a climber starting at <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> (say A) moves to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>, and the other climber (say B) moves from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>6</SUB></SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>5</SUB></SPAN>; then A moves back to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I></SPAN> while B moves to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>4</SUB></SPAN>; finally A arrives at <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN> and at the same time B also arrives at <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN>. Things can be much more complicated and thus they asked you to write a program to find a pair of move sequences for them.<P>There may exist more than one possible pair of move sequences, and thus you are requested to find the pair of move sequences with the shortest length sum. Here, we measure the length along the route surface, i.e., an uphill path from (0, 0) to (3, 4) has the length of 5.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>The input is a sequence of datasets.<P>The first line of each dataset has an integer indicating the number of points <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> ( <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/p5071.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>N</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/p5071.png ALT="$ \le$">100</SPAN>) on the route.

<P>You are a judge of a programming contest. You are preparing a dataset for a graph problem to seek for the cost of the minimum cost path. You've generated some random cases, but they are not interesting. You want to produce a dataset whose answer is a desired value such as the number representing this year 2010. So you will tweak (which means `adjust') the cost of the minimum cost path to a given value by changing the costs of some edges. The number of changes should be made as few as possible.<P>A non-negative integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN> and a directed graph <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I></SPAN> are given. Each edge of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I></SPAN> is associated with a cost of a non-negative integer. Given a path from one node of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I></SPAN> to another, we can define the cost of the path as the sum of the costs of edges constituting the path. Given a pair of nodes in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I></SPAN>, we can associate it with a non-negative cost which is the minimum of the costs of paths connecting them.<P>Given a graph and a pair of nodes in it, you are asked to adjust the costs of edges so that the minimum cost path from one node to the other will be the given target cost <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN>. You can assume that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN> is smaller than the cost of the minimum cost path between the given nodes in the original graph.<P>For example, in Figure G.1, the minimum cost of the path from node 1 to node 3 in the given graph is 6. In order to adjust this minimum cost to 2, we can change the cost of the edge from node 1 to node 3 to 2. This direct edge becomes the minimum cost path after the change.<P>For another example, in Figure G.2, the minimum cost of the path from node 1 to node 12 in the given graph is 4022. In order to adjust this minimum cost to 2010, we can change the cost of the edge from node 6 to node 12 and one of the six edges in the right half of the graph. There are many possibilities of edge modification, but the minimum number of modified edges is 2.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input is a sequence of datasets.

<P>
Do you know the famous series of children's books named ``Where's Wally"? Each of the books contains a variety of pictures of 
hundreds of people. Readers are challenged to find a person called Wally in the crowd. 

<P>
We can consider ``Where's Wally" as a kind of pattern matching of two-dimensional graphical images. Wally's figure is to be looked 
for in the picture. It would be interesting to write a computer program to solve ``Where's Wally", but this is not an easy task 
since Wally in the pictures may be slightly different in his appearances. We give up the idea, and make the problem much easier 
to solve. You are requested to solve an easier version of the graphical pattern matching problem. 

<P>
An image and a pattern are given. 
Both are rectangular matrices of bits (in fact, the pattern is always square-shaped). 0 means white, and 1 black. The problem here 
is to count the number of occurrences of the pattern in the image, i.e. the number of squares in the image exactly matching the pattern. 
Patterns appearing rotated by any multiples of 90 degrees and/or turned over forming a mirror image should also be taken into account.

<P>Dr. Jimbo, an applied mathematician, needs to calculate matrices all day for solving his own problems. In his laboratory, he uses an excellent application program for manipulating matrix expressions, however, he cannot use it outside his laboratory because the software consumes much of resources. He wants to manipulate matrices outside, so he needs a small program similar to the excellent application for his handheld computer.<P>Your job is to provide him a program that computes expressions of matrices.<P>Expressions of matrices are described in a simple language. Its syntax is shown in Table J.1. Note that even a space and a newline have meaningful roles in the syntax.<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Table J.1: Syntax in BNF (a newline is denoted by NL)</DIV><PRE>

</PRE><P>The start symbol of this syntax is <TT>program</TT> that is defined as a sequence of <TT>assignment</TT>s in Table J.1. Each <TT>assignment</TT> has a variable on the left hand side of an equal symbol (``<TT>=</TT>") and an expression of matrices on the right hand side followed by a period and a newline (NL). It denotes an assignment of the value of the expression to the variable. The variable (<TT>var</TT> in Table J.1) is indicated by an uppercase Roman letter. The value of the expression (<TT>expr</TT>) is a matrix or a scalar, whose elements are integers. Here, a scalar integer and a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1 <TT>x</TT> 1</SPAN> matrix whose only element is the same integer can be used interchangeably.<P>An expression is one or more terms connected by ``<TT>+</TT>" or ``<TT>-</TT>" symbols. A term is one or more factors connected by ``<TT>*</TT>" symbol. These operators (``<TT>+</TT>", ``<TT>-</TT>", ``<TT>*</TT>") are left associative.<P>A factor is either a primary expression (<TT>primary</TT>) or a ``<TT>-</TT>" symbol followed by a factor. This unary operator ``<TT>-</TT>" is right associative.<P>The meaning of operators are the same as those in the ordinary arithmetic on matrices: Denoting matrices by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I> + <I>B</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I> - <I>B</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I>*<I>B</I></SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">- <I>A</I></SPAN> are defined as the matrix sum, difference, product, and negation. The sizes of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> should be the same for addition and subtraction. The number of columns of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> and the number of rows of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> should be the same for multiplication.<P>Note that all the operators <TT>+</TT>, <TT>-</TT>, <TT>*</TT> and unary -- represent computations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and negation modulo <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I> = 2<SUP>15</SUP> = 32768</SPAN>, respectively. Thus all the values are nonnegative integers between 0 and 32767, inclusive. For example, the result of an expression <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2 - 3</SPAN> should be 32767, instead of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">-1</SPAN>.<P><P><BR><TT>inum</TT> is a non-negative decimal integer less than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>.<P><P><BR><TT>var</TT> represents the matrix that is assigned to the variable <TT>var</TT> in the most recent preceding assignment statement of the same variable.<P><P><BR><TT>matrix</TT> represents a mathematical matrix similar to a 2-dimensional array whose elements are integers. It is denoted by a <TT>row-seq</TT> with a pair of enclosing square brackets. <TT>row-seq</TT> represents a sequence of <TT>rows</TT>, adjacent two of which are separated by a semicolon. <TT>row</TT> represents a sequence of expressions, adjacent two of which are separated by a space character.<P><P><BR>For example, <TT>[1 2 3;4 5 6]</TT> represents a matrix <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="95" HEIGHT="56" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/50/5076img1.png ALT="$ \begin{pmatrix}{1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \cr 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6} \end{pmatrix}$"></SPAN>. The first row has three integers separated by two space characters, i.e. ``1 2 3". The second row has three integers, i.e. ``4 5 6". Here, the <TT>row-seq</TT> consists of the two rows separated by a semicolon. The matrix is denoted by the <TT>row-seq</TT> with a pair of square brackets.<P>Note that elements of a row may be matrices again. Thus the nested representation of a matrix may appear. The number of rows of the value of each expression of a <TT>row</TT> should be the same, and the number of columns of the value of each <TT>row</TT> of a <TT>row-seq</TT> should be the same.<P>For example, a matrix represented by<P><PRE>

The two indices specify the submatrix extracted from the matrix which is the value of the preceding primary expression. The size of the submatrix is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>l</I></SPAN> and whose <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>a</I>, <I>b</I>)</SPAN>-element is the <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>i</I><SUB>a</SUB>, <I>j</I><SUB>b</SUB>)</SPAN>-element of the value of the preceding primary expression. The way of indexing is one-origin, i.e., the first element is indexed by 1.<P>For example, the value of <TT>([1 2;3 4]+[3 0;0 2])([1],[2])</TT> is equal to 2, since the value of its primary expression is a matrix <TT>[4 2;3 6]</TT>, and the first index <TT>[1]</TT> and the second <TT>[2]</TT> indicate the (1, 2)-element of the matrix. The same integer may appear twice or more in an index matrix, e.g., the first index matrix of an expression <TT>[1 2;3 4]([2 1 1],[2 1])</TT> is <TT>[2 1 1]</TT>, which has two <TT>1</TT>'s.

<P>There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> towns in our country, and some of them are connected by electricity cables. It is known that every town owns a power station. When a town's power station begins to work, it will provide electric power for this town and the neighboring towns which are connected by cables directly to this town. However, there are some strange bugs in the electric system -- One town can only receive electric power from no more than one power station, otherwise the cables will be burned out for overload.<P>The power stations cannot work all the time. For each station there is an available time range. For example, the power station located on Town 1 may be available from the third day to the fifth day, while the power station on Town 2 may be available from the first day to the forth day. You can choose a sub-range of the available range as the working time for each station. Note that you can only choose one sub-range for each available range, that is, once the station stops working, you cannot restart it again. Of course, it is possible not to use any of them.<P>Now you are given all the information about the cable connection between the towns, and all the power stations' available time. You need to find out a schedule that every town will get the electricity supply for next <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I></SPAN> days, one and only one supplier for one town at any time.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>There are several test cases.

<P>You may not hear about Nubulsa, an island country on the Pacific Ocean. Nubulsa is an undeveloped country and it is threatened by the rising of sea level. Scientists predict that Nubulsa will disappear by the year of 2012. Nubulsa government wants to host the 2011 Expo in their country so that even in the future, all the people in the world will remember that there was a country named ``Nubulsa".<P>As you know, the Expo garden is made up of many museums of different countries. In the Expo garden, there are a lot of bi-directional roads connecting those museums, and all museums are directly or indirectly connected with others. Each road has a tourist capacity which means the maximum number of people who can pass the road per second.<P>Because Nubulsa is not a rich country and the ticket checking machine is very expensive, the government decides that there must be only one entrance and one exit. The president has already chosen a museum as the entrance of the whole Expo garden, and it's the Expo chief directory Wuzula's job to choose a museum as the exit.<P>Wuzula has been to the Shanghai Expo, and he was frightened by the tremendous ``people mountain people sea" there. He wants to control the number of people in his Expo garden. So Wuzula wants to find a suitable museum as the exit so that the ``max tourists flow" of the Expo garden is the minimum. If the ``max tourist flow" is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I></SPAN>, it means that when the Expo garden comes to ``stable status", the number of tourists who enter the entrance per second is at most <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I></SPAN>. When the Expo garden is in ``stable status", it means that the number of people in the Expo garden remains unchanged.<P>Because there are only some posters in every museum, so Wuzula assume that all tourists just keep walking and even when they come to a museum, they just walk through, never stay.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT> </H2><P>There are several test cases, and the input ends with a line of ``<TT>0 0 0</TT>".<P>For each test case:<P>The first line contains three integers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>, representing the number of the museums, the number of roads and the No. of the museum which is chosen as the entrance (all museums are numbered from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>).

<P>
On the planet Pandora, huge rocks are floating in the sky. Despite the 
beautiful scenery, these rocks bring some critical problem: they block 
the sunshine, and shade on the ground. Na'vi (``people" living on the 
planet) cannot grow plants in the shade because of the lack of sunshine. 
In order to predicate the amount of food they can get, they have to 
calculate the area of the shade. 

<P>
Let's assume the ``sun" as a point-source of light, and the ground as a 
infinite flat plane. Also, to simplify this problem, assume all rocks 
are convex polyhedrons. 

<P>
Now here is a mathematical problem. Given the position of the point-source 
of light, the position of a convex polyhedron and the position of an 
infinite plane, you are required to calculate the area of the shade. 
Please note that light travels in a strictly straight line and the 
light source and the convex polyhedron are on the same side of the plane. 
The light source is not placed in the convex polyhedron, nor on the 
polyhedron or on the plane.

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Hint:</SPAN>
Here are some hints to help you implement rotation in 3-dimensional 
space. 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Assume that there is a plane <!-- MATH
 $ax + by + cz = 0$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ax</I> + <I>by</I> + <I>cz</I> = 0</SPAN>, and our task is to 
rotate the whole space so that the plane will be in the position <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I> = 0</SPAN>. 

<P>
As we all know, the normal vector of the plane is <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>a</I>, <I>b</I>, <I>c</I>)</SPAN> , so after 
we rotate the space, the normal vector will be the z-axis. So we can only 
consider how to rotate the vector to the position 
<!-- MATH
 $(0,0, \sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2}})$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(0, 0,<IMG
 WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/51/5100img1.png
 ALT="$ \sqrt{{a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2}}}$">)</SPAN>. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>We can divide the process into 2 steps. First step, rotate the normal 
vector to <!-- MATH
 $(0, \sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}}, c)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(0,<IMG
 WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/51/5100img1.png
 ALT="$ \sqrt{{a^{2} + b^{2}}}$">, <I>c</I>)</SPAN>. Second step, rotate 
<!-- MATH
 $(0, \sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}}, c)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(0,<IMG
 WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/51/5100img1.png
 ALT="$ \sqrt{{a^{2} + b^{2}}}$">, <I>c</I>)</SPAN> to <!-- MATH
 $(0,0, \sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2}})$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(0, 0,<IMG
 WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/51/5100img1.png
 ALT="$ \sqrt{{a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2}}}$">)</SPAN>. 
Then apply the two rotation steps on the whole space, we can rotate the 
plane to a given position. 

<P>
It is easy to implement the two steps. In first step, the third number 
in the normal vector does not change, so this is like rotation in a 
2-dimensional space. Similarly, we implement the second step.

``Farm Game" is one of the most popular games in online community. In the 
community each player has a virtual farm. The farmer can decide to plant 
some kinds of crops like wheat or paddy, and buy the corresponding crop 
seeds. After they grow up, The farmer can harvest the crops and sell 
them to gain virtual money. The farmer can plant advanced crops like 
soybean, watermelon or pumpkin, as well as fruits like lychee or mango. 

<P>
Feeding animals is also allowed. The farmer can buy chicken, rabbits or 
cows and feeds them by specific crops or fruits. For example, chicken eat 
wheat. When the animals grow up, they can also ``output" some products. 
The farmer can collect eggs and milk from hens and cows. They may be 
sold in a better price than the original crops. 

<P>
When the farmer gets richer, manufacturing industry can be set up by 
starting up some machines. For example, Cheese Machine can transfer 
milk to cheese to get better profits and Textile Machine can spin cony 
hair to make sweaters. At this time, a production chain appeared in the 
farm. 

<P>
Selling the products can get profits. Different products may have 
different price. After gained some products, the farmer can decide 
whether to sell them or use them as animal food or machine material 
to get advanced products with higher price. 

<P>
Jack is taking part in this online community game and he wants to get as 
higher profits as possible. His farm has the extremely high level so that 
he could feed various animals and build several manufacturing lines to 
convert some products to other products. 

<P>
In short, some kinds of products can be transformed into other kinds of 
products. For example, 1 pound of milk can be transformed into 0.5 pound 
of cheese, and 1 pound of crops can be transformed into 0.1 pound of eggs, 
etc. Every kind of product has a price. Now Jack tell you the amount of 
every kind of product he has, and the transform relationship among all 
kinds of products, please help Jack to figure out how much money he can 
make at most when he sell out all his products. 

<P>
Please note that there is a transforming rule: if product A can be 
transformed into product B directly or indirectly, then product B can 
never be transformed into product A, no matter directly or indirectly.

Plain of despair was once an ancient battlefield where those brave 
spirits had rested in peace for thousands of years. Actually no one 
dare step into this sacred land until the rumor that ``there is a 
huge gold mine underneath the plain" started to spread. 

<P>
Recently an accident destroyed the eternal tranquility. Some greedy 
fools tried using powerful bombs to find the hidden treasure. Of course 
they failed and such behavior enraged those spirits - the consequence 
is that all the human villages nearby are haunted by ghosts. 

<P>
In order to stop those ghosts as soon as possible, Panda the Archmage and 
Facer the great architect figure out a nice plan. Since the plain can 
be represented as grids of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> rows and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> columns, the plan is that we 
choose ONLY ONE cell in EACH ROW to build a magic tower so that each tower 
can use holy light to protect the entire ROW, and finally the whole plain 
can be covered and all spirits can rest in peace again. It will cost 
different time to build up a magic tower in different cells. The 
target is to minimize the total time of building all <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> towers, one in 
each row. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
``Ah, we might have some difficulties." said Panda, ``In order to control 
the towers correctly, we must guarantee that every two towers in two 
consecutive rows share a common magic area." 

<P>
``What?" 

<P>
``Specifically, if we build a tower in cell <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>i</I>, <I>j</I>)</SPAN> and another tower in 
cell <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>i</I> + 1, <I>k</I>)</SPAN>, then we shall have <!-- MATH

<P>
``How?" 

<P>
``Ur, I forgot that you cannot sense the magic power. Here is a map which 
shows the scale of magic flows in each cell. And remember that the 
constraint holds for every two consecutive rows." 

<P>
``Understood."

My kid's school cleared a large field on their property recently to
convert it into a playing area.&nbsp; The field is polygonal.&nbsp; The
school administration decided to separate the field into two areas by
building a straight picket fence between the area for the older kids
and the area for the younger kids.&nbsp; The fence would go between two
non-adjacent vertices of the polygonal field, and given the shape of
the field, all such possible fences would lie strictly and entirely
within the field.<br>
Naturally, the smaller of the two areas would go to the younger
kids.&nbsp; So can you help the school determine what the area of the
smaller play-area would be for different fence positions?<br>
<br>

<h3>
INPUT (Stdin):</h3>

Input consists of several datasets. The first line of each dataset contains 2 numbers N denoting the number of points in
the convex polygon and Q denoting the number of possible locations of
straight line fences.<br>
The next N lines contain 2 integers each. The ith line contains the
integers xi yi denoting the coordinates of the ith point of the
polygon. The points are given in clockwise order.<br>
The next Q lines contain 2 integers a b denoting that a straight line fence is to be drawn connecting a and b.<br>
End of input will be marked with a case with N=0 and Q=0.
<br>
<h3>
OUTPUT (Stdout)</h3>

For each dataset, qutput Q lines one corresponding to each query. For each query, output
the area of the smaller region for the corresponding query rounded to 1
decimal place. Always have 1 digit after the decimal place, so if the
answer is 1, output it as 1.0 instead.&nbsp; Always have at least one digit before the decimal point also.<br>
<br>Print a blank line between datasets.

<h3>
EXPLANATION</h3>

The polygon is given by the points (0,0) (0,1) (1,2) (1,0). <br>
In the first query, we join the points (0,1) and (1,0) which leads to
the 2 areas given by (0,0) (0,1) (1,0) and (0,1) (1,2) (1,0). The first
triangle has an area of 0.5 and the second triangle has an area of 1.
The minimum of these 2 is 0.5.<br>
In the second query, we join the points (0,0) and (1,2) which leads to
the 2 areas given by (0,0) (0,1) (1,2) and (0,0) (1,2) (1,0). The first
triangle has an area of 0.5 and the second triangle has an area of 1.
The minimum of these 2 is 0.5.<br>

A regular expression is used to describe a set of strings. For this
problem the alphabet is limited to 'a' and 'b'. R is a regular
expression if:<br>
1) R is "a" or "b"<br>
2) R is of the form "(R1R2)" where R1 and R2 are regular expressions<br>
3) R is of the form "(R1|R2)" where R1 and R2 are regular expressions<br>
4) R is of the form "(R1*)" where R1 is a regular expression.<br>
<br>
The set of strings recognised by R are as follows:<br>
1) If R is "a", then the set of strings recognised = {a}<br>
2) If R is "b", then the set of strings recognised = {b}<br>
3) if R is of the form "(R1R2)" then the set of strings recognised =
all strings which can be obtained by a concatenation of strings s1 and
s2 where s1 is recognised by R1 and s2 by R2.<br>
4) if R is of the form "(R1|R2)" then the set of strings recognised = union of the set of strings recognised by R1 and R2.<br>
5) If R is of the form "(R1*)" then the the strings recognised are the
empty string and the concatenation of an arbitrary number of copies of
any string recognised by R1.<br>
<br>
The edit distance between two strings s1 and s2 is the minimum number
of characters to be inserted/deleted or replaced in s1 to make it equal
to s2.<br>
<br>
Given two regular expressions R1 and R2, find the minimum edit distance
amongst all pairs of strings s1 and s2 such that s1 is recognised by R1
and s2 is recognised by R2.<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Input (STDIN): </span></big><br>
The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. <br>
Each test case contains two lines containing two regular expressions R1 and R2. There is a blank line after each test case.<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Output (STDOUT):</big><br>
Output T lines one corresponding to each test case containing the required answer for the corresponding test case.<br>
<h3>Constraints:</h3>
T &lt;= 85<br>

You all know about factorization of an integer.&nbsp; Here we want you
to factor a number into as few factors as possible.&nbsp; That is easy,
you say, just have the number itself, and that will be the smallest
number of factors i.e. 1.<br>
But wait, I haven't finished -- each of the factors that you find must
be square-free.&nbsp; A square-free number, however you factor it,
won't have any factor that is a perfect square.&nbsp; Of course, you
can never include 1 as a factor.<br>
<h3>INPUT (Stdin)</h3>
The first line of input is the number of test cases T.<br>

My kid's favorite subject is math, as you know by now.&nbsp; He is learning<br>
division now, and his teacher has taught him about even numbers being<br>
divisible by 2, numbers whose digits add up to a multiple of 3 being<br>
exactly divisible by 3 etc.<br>
He was familiar with division by 11 during selection for soccer teams<br>
on his playground, and was wondering whether there was any easy rule<br>
to see if a number was divisible by 11.&nbsp; For example, he wondered, if<br>
he arranged a number of digits 0-9 in a row to form a number, which<br>
ones would be divisible by 11?<br>
He decided to start off with d[1] 1's, d[2] 2's ..., d[9] 9's, and<br>
seeing what is the minimum multiple of 11 that he could get by using all<br>
these digits, together with any number of 0's.&nbsp; Please help him figure<br>
out how many digits there are in this minimum multiple.<br>
<h3>Input (STDIN):</h3>
The first line will contain the number of test cases T. T lines follow<br>
one corresponding to each test case. Each line has 9 integers<br>
d[1],...,d[9].<br>
<h3>Output (STDOUT):</h3>
Output T lines one corresponding to each test case. The ith line<br>
should contain the required answer for the corresponding test case. <br>
If he will not be able to form a multiple of 11 in this way, print -1.<br>

The department store where my family goes shopping is trying to predict
how much of each item they stock they will sell each month.&nbsp;
Keeping a large amount of inventory is costly, and running out of items
is also not a good idea.&nbsp; Since the manager asked for my help as a
sales consultant, I decided to formulate a model for predicting each
month's sales S of an item based on its sales during the previous R
months.&nbsp; After a lot of trial and error, I came up with such a
model, where<br>
S(n) = a1*S(n-1) + a2*S(n-2) + ... + aR*S(n-R)<br>
where S[n] is the predicted sales for the nth month for n &gt; R, and S(1) to S(R) are seed values.<br>
<br>
The store manager was pleased with my model's ability to help him in controlling his inventory.<br>
He asked me to list out every Kth month's sales, and give him the sum
of the first N values from this list.&nbsp; For example he wanted every
Christmas month's sales summed up for the next 10 years (N=10 and K=12,
month 1 being January), or every end-of-quarter month's sales for the
next 2 years (N=8, K=3).<br>
<br>
Can you please help me write a program that does all the above?<br>
<h3>INPUT (Stdin)</h3>
The first line of the input T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines.<br>
The first line of each test case contains N, R, K.<br>
The second line of each test case contains R integers denoting S(1), S(2), ..., S(R).<br>
The third line of each test case contains R integers denoting the coefficients a1, a2, ..., aR of the predictive model.<br>
<h3>OUTPUT (Stdout)</h3>

<h3>EXPLANATION</h3>
In the first test case, it is given that F(1) = 1 and the relation is
F(n)=2*F(n-1). The sequence G consists of all the terms of F since K is
1. Hence, the answer is just the sum of the first 4 terms of F.<br>
In the second test case, the sequence F is the fibonacci sequence which
is: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34. Sequence G consists of 2, 8, 34 which
sum up to 44.<br>

hope he gets the lead role.)&nbsp; The kids are all excited, but the
teacher has a lot of work.&nbsp; She has to produce costumes for a
scene with K soldiers.&nbsp; She wants to buy all the costumes in the
same size, allowing for some small amount of length alteration to be
done by the kids' parents later.&nbsp; So she has taken all the kids'
height measurements.&nbsp; Can you help her select K kids from her
class of N to play the soldier role, such that the height difference
between the tallest and shortest in the group is minimized, and
alternations will be easiest?&nbsp; Tell her what this minimum

The manager of the multi-storey department store in my town is trying
to figure out how to arrange gifts in his shop for Christmas. He runs a
peculiar shop such that each customer buys exactly two gifts at the
shop (he could buy two of the same gifts too). He knows the probability
that a customer might want gift i, is P_i. <br>
<br>
He needs to arrange the gifts across several floors. Each floor should
have exactly one gift. It takes A*(|x - y|)^2 + B*(|x - y|) + C seconds
to go from floor x to floor y.<br>
<br>
Since my wife takes my kid shopping, he begged me to help the manager
arrange the gifts across floors such that the expected time spent by a
typical shopper such as my wife is minimized.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
For the purpose of this problem assume that the first gift choice and
the second gift choice are independent of each other. i.e., Choosing a
first gift as i does not change his probability of choosing the second
gift as j. It still remains P_j. Do not count the time taken to reach
floor x and leave from floor y -- only count the time taken to go from
x to y.<br>
<h3>Input (STDIN):</h3>
The first line contains the number of test cases T. 2*T lines follow, 2
per test case. The first line contains 4 integers : N, A, B, C. The
second line contains N integers in the range 1 to 100. The ith integer
represents the percentage probability P_i. All P_i's will sum to 100.<br>
<h3>Output (STDOUT):</h3>
Output T lines one for each test case. Each line contains the minimum
expected travelling time for the corresponding test case. Output the
answer as a reduced fraction as below.<br>

There are N bottles each having a different chemical. For each chemical
i, you have determined C[i], which means that mixing chemicals i and
C[i] causes an explosion. You have K distinct boxes. In how many ways
can you divide the N chemicals into those boxes such that no two
chemicals in the same box can cause an explosion together?<br>
<h4>INPUT (Stdin):</h4>
The first line of input is the number of test cases T. T test cases follow each containing 2 lines.<br>
The first line of each test case contains 2 integers N and K.<br>
The second line of each test case contains N integers, the ith integer
denoting the value C[i]. The chemicals are numbered from 0 to N-1.<br>
<h4>OUTPUT (Stdout):</h4>
For each testcase, output the number of ways modulo 1,000,000,007.<br>
<h4>CONSTRAINTS:</h4>
T &lt;= 50<br>
2 &lt;= N &lt;= 100<br>
2 &lt;= K &lt;= 1000<br>
0 &lt;= C[i] &lt; N<br>
For all i, i != C[i]<br>

<h4>EXPLANATION:</h4>
In the first test case, we cannot mix any 2 chemicals. Hence, each of
the 3 boxes must contain 1 chemical, which leads to 6 ways in total.<br>
In the third test case, we cannot put the 3 chemicals in the 2 boxes satisfying all the 3 conditions.<br>

Associated with the zombie apocalypse is the notion of a critical mass of zombies: once the number of 
zombies exceeds a certain threshold <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>, all is lost. Your city is in a precarious state: its current 
population is <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3<I>T</I></SPAN>. Even worse, you suspect someone in the city may be infected, although you have no 
idea who it may be. Once the symptoms manifest, it will be too late for that person, as well as for 
everyone else in the city that person can reach.

<P>
To prevent the possibility of reaching critical mass, 
you are going to divide the city into 3 regions via a set of walls. The city is triangular, 
and so you are going to divide the city into 3 smaller triangles by choosing a single splitting point 
and erecting straight walls between that point and the three vertices of the outer wall. 
This must be done immediately, i.e., there is no time to relocate people. Can you find a splitting 
point such that the three resulting regions each have exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> people?

In the movie, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, a very crucial scene centered around the 
question ``What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?" Perhaps the more important 
question for an undead ornithologist, ``What is the swallowing capacity of a zombie swallow?"

It turns out that in order to control a zombie swallow, you must control what the zombie swallow 
swallows. After rising from its grave, a zombie swallow has an empty stomach. To keep a zombie 
swallow alive, you must feed it immediately. Furthermore, each zombie swallow must swallow enough 
insects to meet its minimum energy requirements, yet at the same time, no more insects than can 
fit inside its stomach. Thus, when presented with a set of insects to feed upon, the swallow does 
its best to choose which insects it will swallow so that it meets its minimum energy requirement 
of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I><SUB>mini</SUB></SPAN> micrograms of insects and does not exceed its stomach capacity of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I><SUB>maxi</SUB></SPAN> micrograms of insects. 
If a swallow finds enough micrograms of insects to meet these requirements, the swallow will survive 
to swallow another day. Whenever a swallow starts to feed, it attempts to find a subset of insects 
that are as close to the midrange of its feeding requirements as possible.

Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, by Jane Austen and Seth Grahame-Smith, spices up the famous 1813 
satire about marriage and social convention with intercalary appearances by zombies, skunks, ghouls, 
chipmunks and ninjas. Most literary critics praised PPZ (as it's known on Facebook) as ``clever", 
``insightful", holding ``indomitable appeal", although Macy Halford of The New Yorker 
condemned Mr. Grahame-Smith's retelling as ``awful", and ``one hundred per cent terrible".

<P>
Here's a little known fact: the book's release was delayed by some 8 years due to several 
heated disagreements between Mr. Grahame-Smith and the editors at Quirk Books, the small publishing 
house in Philadelphia that eventually published the novel. The most impassioned of the arguments 
centered on the controversial ``Vampire Number" chapter, where Mrs. Bennett Ã¢Â€Â” desperate to rally 
the English countryside's interest in matrimony Ã¢Â€Â” contrives a social event where 50 men and 50 women 
draw slips of paper from a large, feathery hat. ``It is an axiom generally acknowledged, that a single 
man in possession of the complementary multiplicand, must be in want of a wife", says Mrs. Bennett in 
announcing the event. On each slip of paper is a single three-digit number. The goal of the event 
was for each of the women to find the man whose three-digit number, when multiplied by her own, 
produced a six-digit number that reproduced the digits of the two ``multiplicands" (Mrs. Bennett's word) 
with the correct ``distribution" (also her word) in some order. 

<P>
Mr. Grahame-Smith insisted the chapter 
was vital to the story arc, whereas Quirk Books considered it forced, obscure, boring, and 
unnecessarily intellectual. Furthermore, Quirk Books was initially contemplating a limited 
New England release and argued that no one outside of the Pacific Northwest understood math. 
Mr. Grahame-Smith eventually conceded this to be true, and agreed to cut the chapter. 
The chapter's existence only surfaced recently in a follow-up article in The New Yorker where 
Ms. Halford noted the novel would have ``benefitted substantially" had it been included. 

<P>

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Vampire Numbers</SPAN>

<P>
It is generally acknowledged that Vampire numbers are positive integers with 
an even number -- we'll say <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>n</I></SPAN> -- of digits where the <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>n</I></SPAN> digits can be distributed across 
two <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>-digit numbers such that their product equals the original <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>n</I></SPAN>-digit number. 
None of the three numbers can include leading zeroes, and neither of the two <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>-digit 
numbers can have consecutive zeroes anywhere. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
For examples: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>125460 = 204 x 615 (so 125460 is a Vampire number). 
</LI>
<LI>16758243290880 = 1982736 x 8452080 (so 16758243290880 is a Vampire number). 
</LI>
<LI>353 has an odd number of digits, so it can't be a Vampire number by definition. 
</LI>
<LI>3421 can't be subdivided properly, so it's not a Vampire number either.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Write a program that reads in a series of numbers (each at most 18 digits) and prints 
whether or not that number is a Vampire number.

In newsgroups, lists, and other ways of publicly sharing information, one popular method of obscuring 
information without actually hiding it has been the ROT13 algorithm: alphabetic characters are simply 
rotated by 13 positions (modulo 26), so that the encryption and decryption algorithms are identical. 
Messages that are potentially offensive to some readers of the newsgroup or list are purposely posted 
in ROT13 form, on the theory that the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">reader</SPAN> is responsible for changing the offensive material into 
clear-text form, and so that the reader cannot complain about it.

We can use a rotational cipher to 
hide information as well as obscure it. You are responsible for generating the decryption algorithm 
for the encryption algorithm described here. It is restricted to 7-bit ASCII/ANSI characters, and we 
will deal only with the printing characters Ã¢Â€Â” 0x20 (space) up to and including 0x7e (`&nbsp;') for 95 characters. 
This way the encrypted text can still be dealt with as pure text for file manipulation and transmission 
purposes.

But wait! Suddenly, they all stop advancing 
and offer you a deal instead. As it turns out, the zombies are having a problem finding good tasting brains, 
which, to a zombie, are the smart brains (there is nothing more disgusting to a zombie than the brains of a 
communications major). While your brains would be really delicious, the zombies realize that they could be 
put to better use by helping them to find other smart brains. The deal is this: help the zombies determine 
whether a given brain is smart (and therefore tasty) or not, and they will let your team go (at least for now).

<P>
Being the big-brained team that you are, you quickly discover that brains can be determined to be smart 
or not if the brain can return a correct answer to a given Boolean expression. You quickly compile a list 
of Boolean expressions together and set off testing one expression on each brain.

It's well documented that the only way to thwart zombies is to trap them in closed fences. 
Zombie hunters have for years been luring zombies into clear spaces and then erecting such fences 
at lightning speeds so they can't go very far. 

<P>
Unfortunately, government has its zoning laws, its 
taxes, and its building codes, and recently they started to enforce silly constraints on how these 
zombie-enclosing fences can be constructed. According to city codes, fence posts must be planted at 
regular intervals, and the fences themselves must respect arbitrary limits on how many walls can 
surround a unit square of land. We also want to build as long of an enclosing fence as possible, 
because the government has plenty of money to waste on such things.

In post-apocalyptic California, only six teams of Python programmers remain: three who use CPython and 
three who use Jython. Unfortunately, C++-programming zombies roam the streets, so the programmers may 
only leave their safe houses under the guidance of their benevolent dictator, Guido. 

<P>
The six teams control 
a network of safe houses, and through discussions on their social network Facelessbook, they have agreed to 
swap safe houses -- that is, the CPython programmers will move to the houses occupied by the Jython programmers, 
and vice versa. Each night, Guido will guide one team from one safe house to a different, nearby one, 
and he will do this every night until the six teams have exchanged safe houses. 

<P>
Each safe house is only 
large enough for one team, so no two teams can be in the same house at the same time. Tremendous distrust 
exists between the CPython and the Jython programmers, so they insist that Guido alternate between 
leading a CPython team and a Jython team (although on the first night he may pick either.) 

<P>
The network 
of safe houses is well known, both how many exist, and which pairs of houses are close enough to travel 
between in a single night. Your job is to determine the minimum number of nights it will take to exchange 
the six teams, if it can be done at all. 

<P>
There will be at most twenty safe houses, each identified by a 
single lower-case letter. The CPython teams start in houses <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN>; the Jython teams start in 
houses <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>e</I></SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>f</I></SPAN>. At the end of the transfer, the CPython teams must end up in houses <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>e</I></SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>f</I></SPAN>, 
and the Jython teams must end up in houses <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN>.

Tess L. Ation ran into a little problem last week when she demonstrated the beta version of her 
new drawing software.
On the screen she had an elegant demonstration design that illustrated every feature of 
her program; it had taken her hours to produce it. She was just putting the finishing 
touches on it as a group of potential investors entered the room to see the demonstration.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The presentation went well. Near the end, Tess clicked on a control panel button and told 
her audience, ``This is the `snap to grid' control. It forces control points, such as 
vertices, to jump to the nearest grid point. Here, let me show you," and she placed 
three bright red dots on the screen. Each one appeared at the grid point nearest to where
she clicked. (``Luckily all control points in my demo design were already at integer 
coordinates. But I will have to remember to delete these three red dots before I save my 
diagram," she thought to herself.) ``Now I'll step into the next room and get out of your 
way so you can discuss the system among yourselves and get a closer look at the screen, but
please don't touch anything, since I haven't saved that file yet."

<P>

<P>
<BR>
A few minutes later, the group joined Tess. One of the visitors stepped up to Tess and said, 
``I hope you don't mind, but I wanted to try it myself. Don't worry, I just played with the 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>-scale and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>-scale controls a little bit." The next person said, ``Sorry if this is a 
problem, but I really wanted to get a feel for the speed of display, so I just played around
with the translation tool." And a third person said, ``I couldn't resist just one tiny test: 
I rotated the image just so I could see all of the vertices snap to the nearest grid 
points after the rotation."

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The person who played with the rotation tool remembered going first, but the other two could 
not recall their order. The three remembered only a few details of the changes. The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>- 
and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>-scaling factors had been (possibly negative) nonzero integers; the center of scaling 
was the origin (0, 0). The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>- and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>-translation amounts had been integers. Rotation
had been specified by a point with integer coordinates <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>)</SPAN> on the perimeter of a square 
of width 20 centered at the origin (hence, <!-- MATH

 ALT="$ \le$">10</SPAN> and the absolute value of 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> or both was 10). The tool rotated the drawing around the origin such that the 
positive <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>-axis would pass through <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>)</SPAN> afterwards. Snapping took place after this 
rotation (coordinates with a fractional part of 0.5 were rounded away from zero).

<P>

<P>
<BR>
After they left, Tess looked at her design -- it was completely changed! She had not yet 
implemented the ``undo" feature, and she had not saved the diagram prior to giving the 
demonstration. However, the three identical red dots were still there (transformed to other 
integer grid locations, of course), and Tess could remember the integer coordinates where
she had originally placed them. Obviously, someone else might have altered the drawing 
without saying anything to her, but she could write a program to see if it was possible 
to reconstruct the sequence of alterations. Can you too?

A prominent microprocessor company has enlisted your help to lay out some interchangeable 
components (widgets) on some of their computer chips. Each chip's design is an <!-- MATH
 $N \times N$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>N</I></SPAN> 
square of slots. One slot can hold a single component, and you are to try to fit in as many 
widgets as possible.

<P>
Modern processor designs are complex, of course. You unfortunately have several restrictions:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Some of the slots are disabled.
</LI>
<LI>Some of the slots are already occupied by other components and cannot 
be used for widgets.
</LI>
<LI>There are sibling memory buses connected to the horizontal and vertical edges 
of the chip and their bandwidth loads need to match. As such, there must be exactly as 
many components in the first row as in the first column, exactly as many in the second 
row as in the second column, and so on. Component counts include both the components 
already specified on the chip and the added widgets.
</LI>
<LI>Similarly, the power supply is connected at the end of each row and column. To avoid 
hot spots, any given row or column must have no more than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I>/<I>B</I></SPAN> of the total components on the 
chip for a given <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
A specification for a chip is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> lines of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> characters, where `<code>.</code>' indicates an open 
slot, `<code>/</code>' indicates a disabled slot, and `<code>C</code>' indicates a slot already occupied 
by a component. For example:

/.C..
/./C/
</PRE> 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
If no more than <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3/10</SPAN> of the components may be in any one row or column, the maximum 
number of widgets that can be added to this <!-- MATH
 $5 \times 5$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">5 <TT>x</TT> 5</SPAN> chip is 7. A possible arrangement is

Is it just a fad or is it here to stay? You're not sure, but the steadily increasing number 
of coffee shops that are opening in your hometown has certainly become quite a draw. 
Apparently, people have become so addicted to coffee that apartments that are close to 
many coffee shops will actually fetch higher rents.

<P>
This has come to the attention of a local real-estate company. They are interested in 
identifying the most valuable locations in the city in terms of their proximity to large 
numbers of coffee shops. They have given you a map of the city, marked with the locations 
of coffee shops. Assuming that the average person is willing to walk only a fixed
number of blocks for their morning coffee, you have to find the location from which one 
can reach the largest number of coffee shops. As you are probably aware, your hometown is 
built on a square grid layout, with blocks aligned on north-south and east-west axes. Since 
you have to walk along streets, the distance between intersections <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>a</I>, <I>b</I>)</SPAN> and
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>c</I>, <I>d</I> )</SPAN> is <!-- MATH

<P>You are the director of Arbitrarily Complex Machines (ACM for short), a company producing advanced machinery using even more advanced machinery. The old production machinery has broken down, so you need to buy new production machines for the company. Your goal is to make as much money as possible during the restructuring period.

Magic was accepted by all ancient peoples as a technique to compel the help of divine 
powers. In a well-known story, one group of sorcerers threw their walking sticks on the 
floor where they magically appeared to turn into live serpents.
In opposition, another person threw his stick on the floor, where it turned into a serpent 
which then consumed the sorcerers' serpents!

<P>
The only magic required for this problem is its solution. You are given a magic stick 
that has several straight segments, with joints between the segments that allow the 
stick to be folded. Depending on the segment lengths and how they are folded, the segments 
of the stick can be arranged to produce a number of polygons. You are to determine the 
maximum area that could be enclosed by the polygons formed by folding the stick, using each 
segment in at most one polygon. 
Segments can touch only at their endpoints. For example, the stick shown below on the left 
has five segments and four joints. It can be folded to produce a polygon as shown on the right.

series of tunnels that meet at various large junctions. Unlike some owners, Digger 
actually cares about the welfare of his workers and has a concern about the layout of 
the mine. Specifically, he worries that there may a junction which, in case of collapse, 
will cut off workers in one section of the mine from other workers (illudium phosdex, as 
you know, is highly unstable). To counter this, he wants to install special escape 
shafts from the junctions to the surface. He could install one escape shaft at
each junction, but Digger doesn't care about his workers that much. Instead, he wants 
to install the minimum number of escape shafts so that if any of the junctions collapses, 
all the workers who survive the junction collapse will have a path to the surface.

<P>
Write a program to calculate the minimum number of escape shafts and the total number 
of ways in which this minimum number of escape shafts can be installed.

During an excursion to the desert at the 2011 ACM-ICPC World Finals, you 
come across an old Egyptian tomb. Unfortunately, opening the tomb turns out to be a 
bad idea: all of a sudden, what was just a few moments ago an empty desert has now become 
a desert crawling with grumpy mummies (you would be grumpy too if you were
suddenly awakened after a few thousand years of peaceful sleep).

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Faced with this murderous mass of mad mummies, your only chance is to run for it and try 
to escape before they catch you. The question is: how long will it take before a mummy 
catches you, assuming neither you nor the mummies ever get tired?

<P>
We model the desert as a grid of squares. You and the mummies take turns making moves 
on the grid. You make the first move. In your turns, you can move to any of the eight 
squares adjacent to your current location, or you can choose to stand still. In the 
mummies' turns, each mummy simply moves to the adjacent square that brings it closest to
you (measured by Euclidean distance, assuming that you and all the mummies stand in 
the centers of their respective squares). It is possible for two mummies to occupy the 
same square. 

<P>
A time step consists of your move followed by the mummies' moves. A mummy 
catches you if it moves to the square where you are located, or if you move to the square 
occupied by the mummy. Of course, you try to avoid being caught for as long as possible. 
After how many time steps will you be caught?

The figure illustrates what might happen if you are being chased by four mummies. The 
square labeled H is your initial position, and the squares labeled M are the initial 
positions of mummies. After four time steps, you are caught by the mummy whose initial 
position was (3, 4) with respect to your initial position.

<P>It is not too hard to build a pyramid if you have a lot of identical cubes. On a flat foundation you lay, say, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">10 <TT>x</TT> 10</SPAN> cubes in a square. Centered on top of that square you lay a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">9 <TT>x</TT> 9</SPAN> square of cubes. Continuing this way you end up with a single cube, which is the top of the pyramid. The height of such a pyramid equals the length of its base, which in this case is 10. We call this a <SPAN CLASS="textit">high</SPAN> pyramid.<P>If you think that a high pyramid is too steep, you can proceed as follows. On the <SPAN CLASS="MATH">10 <TT>x</TT> 10</SPAN> base square, lay an <SPAN CLASS="MATH">8 <TT>x</TT> 8</SPAN> square, then a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">6 <TT>x</TT> 6</SPAN> square, and so on, ending with a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2 <TT>x</TT> 2</SPAN> top square (if you start with a base of odd length, you end up with a single cube on top, of course). The height of this pyramid is about half the length of its base. We call this a <SPAN CLASS="textit">low</SPAN> pyramid.<P><P><BR>Once upon a time (quite a long time ago, actually) there was a pharaoh who inherited a large number of stone cubes from his father. He ordered his architect to use all of these cubes to build a pyramid, not leaving a single one unused. The architect kindly explained that not every number of cubes can form a pyramid. With 10 cubes you can build a low pyramid with base 3. With 5 cubes you can build a high pyramid of base 2.

<P>Allied Chute Manufacturers is a company that builds trash chutes. A trash chute is a hollow tube installed in buildings so that trash dropped in at the top will fall down and be collected in the basement. Designing trash chutes is actually highly nontrivial. Depending on what kind of trash people are expected to drop into them, the trash chute needs to have an appropriate size. And since the cost of manufacturing a trash chute is proportional to its size, the company always would like to build a chute that is as small as possible. Choosing the right size can be tough though.<P>We will consider a 2-dimensional simplification of the chute design problem. A trash chute points straight down and has a constant width. Objects that will be dropped into the trash chute are modeled as polygons. Before an object is dropped into the chute it can be rotated so as to provide an optimal fit. Once dropped, it will travel on a straight path downwards and will not rotate in flight. The following figure shows how an object is first rotated so it fits into the trash chute.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="478" HEIGHT="391" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/51/p5138.png ALT="\epsfbox{p5138.eps}"></DIV><P>Your task is to compute the smallest chute width that will allow a given polygon to pass through.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several test cases.
