<P>
You've been given the unfortunate task of planning text-book wrapping
for your brothers and sisters (still in high-school). To save money, your
parents bought sufficient plastic covering for any concievable number of text-
books (certainly enough for all of the wrapping you will be asked to do).

<P>
The plastic comes in a huge roll (which is guaranteed to be long enough)
1,8m wide. Your parents have also insisted that you plan the book covering
so that a stretch of the roll will be cut off <SPAN  CLASS="textit">straight</SPAN> (meaning that the cut
line will be at 90 degrees to the edges). To save time, you will be wrapping
each book with a rectangular piece of plastic - in particular, you will not
be making any further cutouts to beautify the wrapping.

<P>
Given the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> text-books to be covered, your task is to determine the
mininum length <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> (in millimeters) of plastic to cut from the roll, so that
each book is covered with a 4cm wrap-around (perhaps with some wasteage).
Each of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> books has the usual shape for books (rectangular, and having
both front and back covers) and is described using an ordered sequence of
three integers (measured in millimeters): the height, width, and thickness.
All except the thickness are guaranteed to be positive. (The thickness may,
in fact, be zero in the case that you are asked to cover a leaflet.) You are
guaranteed never to have a book with a dimension greater than 1720mm.

You have been asked to create a code generator for a simple machine. The
input to the code generator (produced by the compiler's front-end) consists
of arithmetic expressions in postfix form (also known as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">post-order</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">reverse
Polish notation</SPAN> form). The output will be in the assembly language of the target
machine.

<P>
The target machine has a single register and a number of temporary locations
(which are allocated by the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">assembler</SPAN> - something beyond the scope of this
problem) named $1, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN> , $9 (to be used in that order). The machine supports
the following instructions, where the operand is either an identifier (identifiers
consist of single letters - either upper and lower case) or a temporary location:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>L</TT> - load the operand into the register.
</LI>
<LI><TT>A</TT> - add the operand to the contents of the register.
</LI>
<LI><TT>S</TT> - subtract the operand from the contents of the register.
</LI>
<LI><TT>M</TT> - multiply the contents of the register by the operand.
</LI>
<LI><TT>D</TT> - divide the contents of the register by the operand.
</LI>
<LI><TT>R</TT> - give the remainder of the contents of the register divided by the operand.
</LI>
<LI><TT>ST</TT> - store the contents of the register in the operand location.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The arithmetic operators replace the contents of the register with the expression
result.

In an effort to entertain your crossword-obsessed aunt and uncle, you decide to work on some software to create compact crosswords. A crossword must be rectangular and adjacent letters must be part of a word. the meaning of `adjacent' differs for the two different types of crosswords - see below.
This problem is case-sensitive.

<P>
There are two types of crosswords:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>strict - these allow words to be vertical and horizontal in the grid only;
      they may be top-to-bottom or vice-versa and left-to-right or right-to-left.
</LI>
<LI>diagonal - these <B>also</B> allow words to appear on a diagonal.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
You are given a sequence of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> words along with possible synonyms (meaning-
equivalents) for that word - no word will appear more than once anywhere
in the input. With this, you are to determine the minimum number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> of
black squares which <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>must</I></SPAN> be present in a crossword for the words. Each
word, or a synonym thereof, must appear exactly once in the crossword and
no additional words may appear.

You are to implement a message decoder for a scheme which sends mes-
sages in two parts: a header and the encoded message itself.

<P>
The foundation of the scheme is a sequence of binary `key' strings as
follows:

<P>
<P><!-- MATH
 \begin{displaymath}
0, 00, 01, 10, 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 0000, \ldots
\end{displaymath}
 -->
</P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay">
0, 00, 01, 10, 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 0000,...
</DIV><P></P>

<P>
The first one is of length 1, the next three of length 2, the next seven of
length 3, next fifteen of length 4, etc. If two adjacent keys have the same
length, the second can be obtained from the first by adding 1. Note that
there are no keys consisting only of 1s.

<P>
The keys are mapped to the characters in the header in order. Suppose
the header is <TT>Bruce</TT>, the first key (0) is mapped to <TT>B</TT>, etc.

<P>
The encoded message contains only 0s and 1s and possibly carriage re-
turns (new-lines) - though they are to be ignored. The message is divided
into segments. The first 3 digits of a segment give the binary representation
of the length of the keys in that segment. For example, if the first 3 digits
are <SPAN CLASS="MATH">011<SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>, then the remainder of the segment consists of keys of length <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3<SUB>10</SUB></SPAN>
(one of <!-- MATH
 $000, 001, \ldots , 110$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">000, 001,..., 110</SPAN>). The end of a segment is a string of 1s which is
the same length as the length of the keys in that segment (this is why all
1s were not used above). So, in the example above, the segment would be
terminated by 111. The entire message is terminated by a segment begining 000 
(which would signify a segment in which keys have length 0). The
message is decoded by translating the keys in the segments into the header
characters to which they have been mapped.

<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>      

<P>
The input file contains several datasets. The first line of each dataset contains the header,
terminated by a new-line (which is not part of the message); any spaces are
part of the header. The length of the header is limited by the fact that
key strings have a maximum length of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">111<SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="MATH">7<SUB>10</SUB></SPAN> in decimal). If there are
multiple copies of a character in the header, then several keys will map to
that character.

<P>
The remaining lines of input contain the encoded message. The message is
made up only of <TT>0</TT>'s and <TT>1</TT>'s (and possibly carriage-returns - to be ignored).
You are guaranteed that it is a valid message according to the encoding
described above.

Markup languages such as HTML use tags to highlight sections with special significance. In this way, a
sentence in boldface can be indicated thus:
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;B>This is a sentence in boldface&lt;/B>
<P>
Typically every tag has an opening tag of the form &lt;TAG> and a closing tag of the form &lt;/TAG>, so that
portions of text can be bracketed as above. Tags can then be combined to achieve more than one effect on a
particular piece of text simply by nesting them properly, for instance:
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;CENTER>&lt;B>This text is centred and in boldface&lt;/B>&lt;/CENTER>
<P>
Two of the most common mistakes when tagging text are:
<li> getting the nesting wrong:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;B>&lt;CENTER>This should be centred boldface, but the tags are wrongly nested&lt;/B>&lt;/CENTER>
<li> forgetting a tag:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;B>&lt;CENTER>This should be centred boldface, but there is a missing tag&lt;/CENTER>
<P>
Write a program to check that all the tags in a given piece of text (a paragraph) are correctly nested,and that
there are no missing or extra tags. An opening tag for this problem is enclosed by angle brackets, and
contains exactly one upper case letter, for example &lt;T>, &lt;X>, &lt;S>. The corresponding closing tag will be
the same letter preceded by the symbol "/". For the examples above these would be &lt;/T>, &lt;/X>, &lt;/S>.

The Department of Defence of a certain country (No, not Australia or New Zealand), in conjunction with
the Department of Police, have devised a brilliant method of saving money on crowd control - really
bouncy rubber bullets. They had noticed that the rubber bullets they had been using were largely being
wasted - those that hit anyone or anything usually just fell to the ground, whereas if they were really,
really bouncy, they would bounce off and possibly hit several more people before their energy was spent.
<P>
They decided to test this idea by building a special circular test rig. The bullet would be fired into the rig
horizontally and at some predetermined angle to the tangent to the rig at that point. It would have sufficient
energy to travel some considerable distance before stopping. (You may assume cartoon physics, i.e. that it
travels horizontally until it reaches the end of its travel, at which time it drops to the floor.) However, as so
often happens with lucrative defence contracts, the contractor made off with the money, so they decided to
simulate the whole process on a computer. This is where you come in.
<P>
Write a program that will read in details of a test rig and a series of test firings and determine how many
times the rubber bullet would bounce before it stops. You may assume that the bullet is a point and that,
because of problems in determining the exact sequence of events, any test firing where the bullet stops
within 1 mm of the rig is deleted from consideration.<P>

Input will be a series of tests, each test consisting of a series of test firings. Each test starts with an integer
specifying the radius of the test rig in millimetres and a value of 0 for the radius terminates the input. Each
test firing occurs on a line by itself and consists of a distance in millimetres (between 100 and 10000
inclusive) that the bullet will travel, and an angle, in degrees, (between 10 and 170 inclusive, where 90
means directly towards the centre of the rig). The series of test firings will be terminated by a line

Lazy LarryÂ’s Leisure Photo Shop specialises in taking shots of people in leisure situations - at the beach,
skiing, in cable cars and so on. When the photographer returns to the office at the end of a shoot, she has
anything up to 50 images which she wishes to display. She has found that the most practical solution is to
lay them out in a single row in a strip across the top of the screen with the first image hard up against the
left of the strip, the rest of the images in order from left to right, and the last image as far right as necessary
or possible.
<P>
<center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2009.jpg></center>
<P>
The images are all of the same height, which comfortably fits into the strip of screen space, but have
varying widths. The photographer can vary the width of the strip within limits, largely dictated by the size
of the screen she is working on and other applications that may be running. When there is enough room,
the images should be packed from left to right with a fixed spacing. When there is not enough room the
spacing has to be reduced until it reaches zero. Thereafter the images must be allowed to overlap.
<P>
Write a program that will read in details of the size of the strip and a series of images and that will
determine the best layout according to the following rules:
<ol><li>Pack the images starting at the left margin as shown in the diagram above with SPACING pixels
between images. This is the ideal case.
<li>Place the first image hard up against the left edge of the strip, the last image hard up against the right
edge of the strip and then place the left edges of the other images on the pixel boundaries closest to
the positions that they would occupy were it possible to contract the spacing in a smooth continuous
manner. Round 0.5 up to the next integer.
<li>Place the last image hard up against the right edge of the strip and overlap the remaining images so
that their left boundaries remain in order from left to right. Allocate each image as many pixels as
possible so that all images have the same proportion (truncated to one pixel) of their width visible. If
there are still pixels left to be allocated, allocate them to images in descending order of the fractional
portions of their desired display width. In case of a tie, allocate the Â‘extraÂ’ pixel to the leftmost image.
<li>Placement is impossible if one or more images are not displayable, i.e. do not have at least one pixel
allocated to them.

the available screen area in pixels, <i>SPACING</i> is the maximum spacing to be used between images and

order, the widths of the images, on one or more lines. You may assume that <i>SPACING</i> &le; 10, that 0 <

Many sports and games hold tournaments to determine at least a winner and, very often, a ranking or
ordering as well. In two player games (such as Tennis, Chess and Scrabble), the two most common forms
of tournament areÂ‘knockoutÂ’ (usually based on an initial ranking or Â‘seedingÂ’) and Â‘round robinÂ’ (where
everybody plays everybody else). The disadvantage in knockout is that a promising newcomer could meet
a very much stronger player early in the tournament and not reach their true position. Round Robin
eliminates this but at a huge cost in time - a Round Robin involving 128 players needs 127 rounds
whereas it would take only 7 rounds in a knockout competition.
<P>
An alternative known as Swiss Draw is very popular in games such as Scrabble. To maximize competition,
any one player will play any other player no more than once. After each round, players are ranked on the
number of games they have won, where a draw is equal to half a win (more is better) and, within that, by
Â‘spreadÂ’ - the cumulative difference between their scores and their opponentsÂ’ scores (again bigger is
better). If by chance two or more players tie in this ranking then they appear in inverse order of their
previous ranking, i.e. the initially lower-ranked players move ahead. In each round each player either plays
someone above them or the highest ranked player below them that allows everyone to play someone they
have not played before. The input will specify the (usually random) ordering before the first game.
<P>
Write a program to determine the final ranking of a group of Scrabble players, given the initial draw and
the scores for each individual for each round.

rounds respectively. This will be followed by P lines, each line consisting of a name (a string of 1 through
20 alphabetic characters without any spaces) followed by R integers (separated from each other and the
name by at least one space) representing the R scores for that individual. The list will be in the initial order
of play, thus in the first round player 2n+1 played player 2n+2 (0 &le; n < P / 2). Input will be terminated by
a line containing two zeroes (i.e. P and R both zero).

Calypso is a fun-filled family card game that has been propagated at the training camps for the Australian
Maths Olympiad teams. The game is designed for four players and will be described in that way, although
I am sure you can adapt it to a different number. I will start with a complete description, since I suspect
most of you will never have heard of it and you may want to play it some time (possibly with your coach
as a fourth on the way to Vancouver next year).
<P>
The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards where each card has a suit: Spades (S), Hearts (H),
Diamonds (D) or Clubs (C) - and a value: 2-9, Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K) and Ace (A).The cards
are ranked (from lowest to highest) in the order given. One person is designated as the dealer, after each
deal this role moves clockwise. To make the following description easier, assume that the four players are
Amy, Bob, Carol and Dave and that they are sitting in that order clockwise around a table. Dave is the first
dealer, Amy will deal next and so on.
<P>
Dave deals one card to each player face down, starting with Amy, and continues until all cards have been
dealt (each player now has 13 cards). Amy now designates how many tricks she expects to take, a number
between 0 and 13, (tricks will be explained later) and her personal trump suit, then Bob does likewise and
so on. Dave as the last bidder must bid for a number of tricks such that the total number of tricks bid (by all
four players) does not equal 13. After this has been done and recorded the play begins.
<P>
Amy then leads to the first trick, i.e. she lays a card face up on the table. Each player in clockwise then
plays a card and the four cards constitute a trick. Each player <b>must</b> follow suit if possible, i.e. play a card
of the same suit as that led. Players who cannot follow suit may play one of their personal trumps or just
discard one of their other cards. The winner of the trick collects it and leads to the next trick. The winner is
determined as follows. If a trick has not been trumped (the leader did not lead anyoneÂ’s personal trump suit
and everyone either followed suit or discarded) then the highest card in the led suit wins. If the trick has
been trumped, then the highest trump wins. If there are two or more trumps of equal value (remember that
everyone has their own trump suit) then the first highest wins. For example, assume that at some stage
Dave led a low diamond, that neither Amy or Bob have any diamonds left, and that AmyÂ’s trump suit is
Hearts and BobÂ’s is Spades. If Amy plays HK and Dave plays SA, he would win. If Amy had played HA,
she would have won, even if Dave had still played SA. When all 13 tricks have been played, players score
the number of tricks they won. In addition, players who achieved their target (won the number of tricks
they bid for) score an extra 10 points.
<P>
In order to simulate this game, we will make the following modifications. Bids will consist of only the
desired trump suit, based on length. If two or more suits are equally long, value the suits by allocating 5
points to an Ace, 4 points to a King, 3 points to a queen, two points to a Jack and 1 point to anything else
and bid the highest valued suit. If there is still a tie, bid the highest ranked suit in the order (from highest to
lowest) S, H, D, C. At the end of a deal each player will merely score the number of tricks they won, with-out
any bonuses.
<P>
When leading, lead the highest card in your trump suit if possible, otherwise lead the highest card in the
highest ranking suit that is not someone elseÂ’s trump suit. If this is not possible, lead the lowest ranked
card in your hand (choosing the lowest ranked suit in case of a tie). When playing, always attempt to win
the trick if you can, otherwise play as cheaply as possible. Thus you will play the highest card in the suit
led, unless a higher card has already been played, in which case play your lowest card in that suit. If you
cannot follow suit, play your highest trump if you can and if it could win. If you have no trumps, or your
highest trump could not win the trick, then discard the lowest card in your hand. If you have two lowest
cards, play the one from the lowest ranking suit (using the ranking given above).
<P>
Consider that the deck is (in order from the top of the deck to the bottom):
<pre>
 C8 HK D6 ST DT H5 S7 C9 DQ DK SA HA D2 S8 CT H8 SJ SQ S4 D8 D7 C3 SK
 H6 HT H4 HQ S2 C6 C2 H9 DJ C7 CK CQ H2 CA DA CJ D5 S3 D3 S6 D9 H3 D4
 S5 C4 H7 C5 HJ S9
</pre>
Thus Dave will deal the C8 to Amy, HK to Bob, D6 to Carol and ST to himself and then continue. The
resulting hands and bids are as follows:
<pre>
 Amy  : C6 C7 C8 CA D2 D7 DT DQ H3 H7 HT S3 SJ bids C
 Bob  : C2 C3 C5 CK D3 D4 DK DA H4 H5 HK S8 SQ bids D
 Carol: CT CJ CQ D6 H9 HJ HQ S4 S5 S6 S7 SK SA bids S
 Dave : C4 C9 D5 D8 D9 DJ H2 H6 H8 HA S2 S9 ST bids H
</pre>
Amy will lead to the first trick. In what follows, the leftmost card is the card led by the winner of the
previous trick (indicated on the right of the previous line). The next three cards are the next three cards
played. Note that the leftmost card is the card that was led, not necessarily the card played by Amy.
<pre>
 Trick  1: CA C2 CT C4 Amy
 Trick  2: C8 C3 CJ C9 Amy
 Trick  3: C7 C5 CQ HA Dave
 Trick  4: H8 H3 H4 H9 Dave
 Trick  5: H6 H7 H5 HJ Dave
 Trick  6: H2 HT HK HQ Dave
 Trick  7: S2 SJ SQ SA Carol
 Trick  8: SK S9 S3 S8 Carol
 Trick  9: S7 ST D2 DA Bob
 Trick 10: DK D6 D5 D7 Bob
 Trick 11: D4 S6 D8 DT Carol
 Trick 12: S5 D9 C6 CK Amy
 Trick 13: DQ D3 S4 DJ Carol
</pre>
Thus at the end of the deal Amy has won 3 tricks, Bob 2 and Carol and Dave 4 each.

Four in a Line is a game similar to 3-dimensional noughts and crosses. It consists of a horizontal table on
which 16 pegs, each of which can hold 4 beads, are arranged in a 4 Ã— 4 grid. Each player has a supply of
either green or red beads which are placed on the pegs in turn, starting with red. Obviously, as each bead is
placed on a peg, it slides down as far as it can - until it either hits another bead or the supporting table.
The winner is the first to get 4 beads of their colour in a line (hence the name). The line can be in any plane
and in any orientation, as long as the four beads are all of the same colour and form a straight line.<P>
<P>
As with most games, the interesting part comes towards the end, when each player (colour) is attempting to
build a line and block the opponentÂ’s incipient lines. Write a program that will read in details of a game
position and determine whether green (the next player) can be guaranteed to win the game within 5 plies.
A ply is half a turn, in this situation placing one bead, thus 5 plies implies three moves by green and two
by red.

Input consists of a number of games. Each game consists of 4 lines of characters, each line consisting of 4
blocks of 4 characters - Â‘RÂ’ for red, Â‘GÂ’ for green or Â‘#Â’ for empty - where each block represents the
contents of a single peg with the left end representing the bottom. Thus the block Â‘GRR#Â’ represents a peg
with a green bead on the bottom with two red beads above it. Note that the entire state of the game is
always given, thus the starting state would consist of 64 Â‘#Â’ characters arranged in 16 blocks of 4. You can
assume that the position is valid, i.e. that there will be exactly one more red bead than green beads, and that
there will not be any Â‘holesÂ’ in the description (the Â‘blockÂ’ GR#G, for instance). There will be one blank
line after each game and input will be terminated by a line containing only a single Â‘#Â’.

<P>You are given a collection of sealed pizza boxes. The tops and bottoms of the boxes are covered internally with metal foil, but the edges are not. Inside, each box has been divided into r rows and c columns (both in the range 2 to 8 inclusive), after the manner of a chess board. Each of the thus-formed internal squares is either empty or contains a single widget. Widgets absorb beta radiation slightly, so by placing a beta emitter on one side of a box and a receiver on the other side you can tell how many widgets there are in the line of sight between emitter and receiver, but not where they are. By appropriate placement of the emitters and receivers we can determine the occupancies along various lines, i.e. how many widgets there are in each row (r numbers), column (c numbers), down diagonal (r+c-1 numbers), and up diagonal (r+c-1 numbers)<P>For example, the following 8 by 8 configuration will produce the numbers shown.<P><center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2013.jpg></center><P>Write a program that will determine the arrangement of widgets in a pizza box, given a set of numbers such as those above.

LaurieÂ’s little brother Joey has been playing Find the Cookie with her.
However, after the 32,767<sup>th</sup> time, Laurie is tired of it.  She wants to write a program to keep the
boy occupied.  Write a program to simulate a game of Find the Cookie.  The game takes place in a long narrow hall,
so Joey can only move forward and backward, not right or left.  At the beginning of each game, a cookie is placed
in the hall (not at the center of the hall) and Joey starts at the center of the hall.  Joey attempts to find the
cookie.  He does this by moving to another point in the hall, whereupon the computer tells him whether he is "warmer"
(he has moved closer to the cookie than his last position), "colder" (he has moved farther away from the cookie than
his last position), "same" (he has not moved closer or farther away from the cookie), or he has reached the cookie.
Joey continues until he exactly reaches the location of the cookie, which always happens within 20 moves.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

Each input line represents a new game.  Each input line contains at least two and at most 21 integers separated
by whitespace.  The integers represent locations along the hall, expressed in units of feet.  Joey begins each
game at location 0 feet.  The first integer on an input line is the location of the cookie.  This integer is
guaranteed to be different from 0.  The remaining integers represent locations Joey moves to, in order.  Joey will
never move more than 5280 feet from his original location.  Joey will always reach the cookie in each game, and this
will be the last move on the input line.  Your program should stop processing input lines when the cookie is located
at 5280 feet (a mile from the center of the hall is way too far for Joey to go for only one cookie).

<P>Bingo is a game played on a 5 by 5 board called a card. There are many variations, but Bob's Bingo uses the following rules:<blockquote><li>Each card will have the 25 positive integers, where each value is less than or equal to 75. <li>No value will appear in more than one position on a card. <li>During the game, numbers are selected and if they are on a card, they are covered. <li>To be a winner, all the numbers on a card in a given pattern must be covered.

<p>Dozens of charity WWW sites have appeared recently.  These sites donate advertising payments they receive to charitable
 organizations.  But advertisers don't want to pay for people who come to the WWW site dozens of time a day, so require
 a list of unique visitors to the site.  Some sites, such as The Hunger Site (thehungersite.com), the original "Click 
for Charity" site, allow only one donation per address per day.  Others, such as the Meals On Wheels site (givemeals.com),
 allow donations as frequently as every 6 hours.</p>

<p>You are to write a program to take a list of visits for a month and list the visitors to the site and the number of
 visits, both valid and invalid, they made in that month.</p>





<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<p>The input data file contains zero or more records of visitors to a charity WWW site, where each record appears on 
single line.  Each visit will be in the following format:</p>

 

<blockquote>dd:hh:mm:ss:address</blockquote>

<p>where:</p>

<blockquote>
	<li>dd  is an integer that represents the day of the visit, with 01 &le; dd &le; 32
	<li>hh       is an integer that represents the hour of the visit, with 00 &le; hh &le; 23
	<li>mm       is an integer that represents the minute of the visit, with 00 &le; mm &le; 59
	<li>ss       is an integer that represents the second of the visit, with 00 &le; ss &le; 59
	<li>address       is a string that represents the email address of the visitor.  The address will consist of
	 the upper and lower case letters, digits, periods ('.'), and the at sign ('@') only.  It will have exactly 
	one '@' in it (that will not be the first character) and at least one period after the '@'.  The '@' and 
	'.' will not appear next to each other.  An address will not end with a '.'.  There will be at most
	 65 characters in the address.  Case is not significant in addresses, so a@b.c and A@B.C should be 
	considered to be the same address.
</blockquote>

<p>The visits will be arranged in time order, from earliest to latest.  While there may be two or more visits at a
 given time, there will not be two visits for the same address at the same time.</p>

<p>There will be at most 1000 unique addresses in the input file.  </p>

<p>The end of input will be indicated by an entry for day 32.  This line should not be processed.</p>






<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<p>Output the number of valid and invalid visits for each address in the file.  A visit is valid if it is the first 
visit in the file for the address or if it is 6 hours or more since the most recent previous valid visit for that
 address.  A visit is invalid if it is not valid (that is, if it is less than 6 hours since the last valid visit 
 for that email address in the file).  </p>

<p>Output should be grouped by top-level domain, and within a top-level domain by the second-level domain. 
 The top-level domain of the address is the character or characters after the last period in the address. 
 The second-level domain is the collection of letters and digits immediately before the last period. 
 For example, the address programmer@acm.cs.gcsu.edu has the top-level domain edu and the second-level domain
 gcsu .  Top-level domains should be alphabetized, then the second-level domains alphabetized under them. 
 For each second-level domain, all the donors in that domain should be listed in ASCII order of address, 
followed by the number of valid donations and invalid donations.  There should be one blank line between
 second-level domains and two blank lines between top-level domains.  Use the format in the sample output.</p>

<p>All email addresses in the output should be in lower case.  </p>

<P>The Olympic committee has hired American Code Masters (ACM) to verify the IDs issued to all the athletes, reserves, judges, staff, and the press. Each badge has a barcode written on it in base-5, encoding the ID number. The system of ID numbers uses a check-digit scheme to detect errors and reduce forgeries. You are to write a program to help ACM detect invalid ID numbers.</p><p>The devices that security uses to read the barcodes produce strings of the letters V,W,X,Y,Z. Each letter represents a base-5 digit: V represents 4, W represents 3, X represents 2, Y represents 1, and Z represents 0. So, WXZ=320 (base-5), which is 85 (base-10). The base-5 number is first converted to a base-10 number. Any number with more than 8 (base-10) digits is considered invalid. Numbers with less than 8 digits are padded on the left with zeroes. IDs are allocated based on the most significant digit (in base-10):</p><blockquote>0, 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; athletes;<br>2, 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reserves,<br>4, 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; judges;<br>6, 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; staff; and<br>8, 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; press.<br></blockquote><p>Consider the ID number d<sub>7</sub> d<sub>6</sub> ... d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>0</sub> expressed in base-10, where d<sub>i</sub> (0&le;i&le;7) is a single digit of the ID number. For this ID to be valid the following checksum value must be 0:</p><blockquote>F(0,d<sub>0</sub>) x F(1,d<sub>1</sub>) x F(2,d<sub>2</sub>) x ... x F(6,d<sub>6</sub>) x F(7,d<sub>7</sub>)</blockquote>We will define the function F(i,j) and the operator x next. The function F is defined as:<center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2017a.gif></center><p>The definition of the function F depends on a permutation of the decimal digits we call G:</p><center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2017a.gif></center><p>That is, G(0)=1, G(1)=5, etc.</p><p>The function i x j is based on dihedral groups and has the nice property that transposing digits in the ID creates a checksum error. It is defined as follows:</p><center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2017a.gif></center>

<p>Note that -4 mod 5 = 1.  </p>

<p>The operator x is left-associative, so for example i x j x k = (i x j) x k.</p>

<p>The first line of the input contains an integer nÂ³1.  Each of the next n lines contains a single scanned

  'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', and 'Z' and will be at least 1 and at most 12 letters long.</p>

The coaches for the US Olympic Track Team, Pierre A. Noid and Ada Noid, fear that their 16-year-old, 7Â’ 2Â’Â’
javelin thrower, Moven van Driver, has not been given a "fair go" by the Olympic referees.  They have 
purchased two distance measuring devices (DMD) to help them check on the accuracy of the measurements 
made by the referees.  There are several elimination rounds for which each coach positions him/herself in 
either coaches area (which includes the boundaries), such that the two coaches are on opposite sides of 
the throwing zone. At the beginning of each round the coaches measure their separation from each other 
and the distance of each from the launching point. During a round the coaches do not move. For each throw 
in each round they record their distances from the landing point, and calculate the distance that should have 
been awarded to Moven. You may assume that the javelin will always land somewhere in the landing area (which 
includes its boundary).</p>

<center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2018a.gif></center>

<p>The following measurements are made, as indicated in the figure above:

<blockquote>
            x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PierreÂ’s distance from the launching point<br>
            y &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdaÂ’s distance from the launching point<br>
            z &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distance between Ada and Pierre<br>
            a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PierreÂ’s distance from the javelinÂ’s landing point<br>
            c &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdaÂ’s distance from the javelinÂ’s landing point<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Your program is to determine b, the actual distance traveled by the javelin
(in meters, to the nearest hundredth of a meter) from the other measurements (given in meters to the
nearest hundredth of a meter).</p>

<p>There will be several groups of input data, each representing a round.  The first line of each group will 
have an integer and three real numbers, n, x, y, and z separated by white space. The first number n is the
number of throws in the current round, such that 0 &le; n &le; 5. The other distance limits are 10 &le; x &le; 100,
10 &le; y &le; 100, and 5 &le; z &le; 100.
 The next n lines will have pairs of real numbers, representing measurements a and c, such that 1 &le; a &le; 100,
 and 0 &le; c &le; 100. The input data is terminated by a value of n=0, followed by three zeros, and this data is not

<p>Dolores's house has an unusual semi-circular driveway that can accommodate 26 cars in a single file, with 
exits at the front and the back.  This is nice because when she hosts a party because everyone can park in 
the driveway.  However, it causes complications when a guest wants to leave, because other guests with cars
 blocking that person must move their cars temporarily.  Her guests take this in stride, and make a game out 
of the nuisance.  When someone leaves, those cars that must move return to the driveway in reverse order.  
Since there are two ways for the leaving car to exit (through the front or rear exit), the cars on the shorter 
path to an exit must move (and return in reverse order). If the car that wants to leave is exactly in the 
middle, the front cars (on the left) must move.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the initial driveway configuration is represented as ABCDEFG.  Suppose further that
 the owner of car E decides to leave.  Then the owners of cars F and G must move (since theyÂ’re on the 
shorter path to an exit) to make room for E to leave, and then return to the driveway in reverse order.
 The new driveway configuration will be ABCDGF. Suppose now C wants to leave. Here, A and B have to move
 (since theyÂ’re on the shorter path to an exit) , with the resulting configuration BADGF. LetÂ’s say that
 now D wants to leave. In this case, B and A must move (since both exit paths are of  equal length, and
 A and B are on the path to the front exit). The resulting configuration is ABGF.</p>

<p>Write a program to simulate this party game.</p>

<p>The judges at the programming contest have been watching the Olympics, and are considering using style
 judging at next yearÂ’s contest.  Particularly, they like the model used in the diving competition where
 each problem is given a degree of difficulty and then six judges will give it a score on a scale from
 0.0 to 10.0.  The high and low score will be discarded, the other four scores added up, and then the
 sum is multiplied by the degree of difficulty.  The team with the highest total score for all their
 problems is declared the winner.</p>

<p>Your job for this problem is to write a program that will read in the number of teams and problems,
 each problemÂ’s degree of difficulty, and the problems that are submitted by each team at an actual
 competition along with each of the six judgesÂ’ scores for those problems.  The program will then print 
a summary showing each teamÂ’s score on each of the problems along with the winning team number and their
 score.  A team is allowed to submit a problem more than once without penalty, but the judgesÂ’ scores 
for the most recent submission are the ones that are used.  In case more than one team has an overall 
score within three hundredths of a point of the high score, your program should indicate there is a 
tie and list the teams with multiple high scores.</p>

<p>The input file will consist of data sets for one or more contests.  Each data set will begin with a
 single integer 0 &lt; n &le; 9, representing the total number of teams competing in the contest. 
 This will be followed by a line that begins with an integer 0 &lt; p &le; 9 indicating the number of 
 problems at the competition, and then p numbers representing the judgesÂ’ difficulty ratings for
 each of the  problems.  Each of the difficulty ratings is a non-negative fixed point value with
 exactly one digit after the decimal point. All judgesÂ’ scores are fixed point numbers in the range 
from 0.0 to 10.0 with one digit after the decimal point.  The next lines contain a teamÂ’s submission 
and the six judgesÂ’ scores for that submission in the following format :</p>

 

<blockquote>
	Team-Number Problem-Number Score<sub>1</sub> Score<sub>2</sub> Score<sub>3</sub> Score<sub>4</sub> Score<sub>5</sub> Score<sub>6</sub>

each of the respective problems in a tabular format as shown below.  All team and problem numbers are 
numbered with positive integers starting at 1 and continuing with each consecutive integer thereafter. 
 The score for each team should be rounded to one digit to the right of the decimal point.

<P>Air transportability is concerned with the packing of cargo on aircraft. In order to ensure safe takeoffs and landings, cargo must be packed according to rigorous rules, which can vary from airplane to airplane. Rules for packing aircraft are:</p><blockquote><li>All aircraft will have weight limits. They cannot hold more than their weight limit, and for the sake of efficiency, no plane may carry less than 50% of its weight limit. <li>Cargo items are rectangular and have uniform weight distribution. Two adjacent items must be at least 1 foot apart to allow for tie downs. <li>All aircraft will have a rectangular area for cargo, the cargo hold. No cargo can be placed within one foot of the edge of the cargo hold to allow space to tie it down. <li>At least 60% of the cargo weight must be put in the front half of the cargo hold. <li>The weight on the left side of the center line must be no more than 5% more or less than the weight on the right hand side of the center line. <li>If a piece of cargo can be moved toward the rear of the plane and still meet the other constraints, then it should be moved toward the rear of the plane because all loading and unloading takes place at the rear of the plane. <li>To allow for speedy loading and unloading, no plane may hold more than 10 items.</blockquote><p>You are to write a program to help allocate cargo to aircraft efficiently.</p><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p><p>The input will consist of one or more input sets. The first line of each input set will be an integer 0 &le; p &le; 20 which represents the number of planes to be loaded. There will then be p sets of plane information. Each set of plane information has two lines. The first has a string of 1 to 25 characters representing the name of the aircraft. No two different aircraft in an input set will have the same name. The second line will have four integers, 0 < x &le; 100, 0 < y &le; 30, 0 < w &le; 100000, 0 < c &le; 20000 where:</p><blockquote><li>x represents the length of the cargo hold (from the front of the plane to the rear of the plane) in feet, <li>y represents the width of the plane (from left to right) in feet, <li>w represents the weight limit of the plane in pounds, <li>c represents the cost of the plane in dollars.</blockquote><p>After the plane information will be the information about the cargo to be loaded. The first line will have a single integer 0 < n &le; 200, representing the number of pieces of cargo to be loaded. There will then be n sets of cargo item information.

<P>A television game show host begins each new game by selecting a player, as follows.  The host asks candidate
 players to order four items.  The first candidate to order the items correctly wins.  If there is a tie for
 the fastest time, or if no one correctly answers, the host poses a new question.  The producers air only
 questions that select a player.  They are unhappy with their current player selection software and are
 seeking a replacement.</p>

<p>The candidates have at most 30 seconds to answer the question.  During this time, they press buttons 
A, B, C, or D, indicating how to order the items.  Pressing a special rub out button marked X erases the 
last selection (this has no effect if there are no characters to rub out).  For example, after pressing 
BXXACXDXBDC, the candidate has selected the answer ABDC.  Each candidateÂ’s selection is sent to the
 software along with a timestamp (from 0 to 300, in tenths of a second) and a number identifying the 
candidate.  A candidate cannot make simultaneous selections (i.e., with the same timestamp), but two 
different candidates might make selections at the same time.  Although the software receives the 
messages in time sequence for a particular candidate, messages from two different candidates may 
arrive out of time sequence.  For example, the software might receive the following sequence:</p>

<center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2023a.gif></center>

<p>Suppose that the correct item order is BDAC.  To be considered correct, a candidate's final answer
 must exactly match the correct item order.  In this example, both candidates have the correct answer,
 but Candidate 2 has the faster time (15.0 seconds), and is the player for the next round.</p>

</H2>

<p>The input contains several player selection rounds.  Each round begins with a line containing two 
integers m and n separated by whitespace, where 2 Â£ m Â£ 10 is the number of candidates and n is the 
number of messages.  The next line contains only the letters A, B, C, and D, in the correct order
 for that round; each letter appears exactly once and in upper case.  The next n lines contain the 
messages in the following format:</p>

 
<blockquote>
	<i>candidate timestamp selection</i>
</blockquote>
 

<p>where candidate is an integer between 1 and m inclusive that identifies the candidate sending 
the message, timestamp is an integer between 0 and 300 inclusive representing the time in tenths
 of a second, and selection is either A, B, C, D, or X (in upper case) as explained above.  Your 
program must stop processing input when it encounters a data set in which n is 0.</p>

<P>A convoy of vehicles has lined up on a single lane and one-way street in front of a single lane and one-way bridge over a river. Note that since the street is single lane, no vehicle can overtake any other. The bridge can sustain a given maximum load. To control the traffic on the bridge, operators are stationed on both ends of the bridge. The convoy of vehicles is to be divided into groups, such that all the vehicles in any group can cross the bridge together. When a group reaches the other side, the operator on that side of the bridge uses a telephone to inform the operator on this side that the next group can start its journey over the bridge. The weight of each vehicle is known. The sum of the weights of the vehicles in any group cannot exceed the maximum load sustainable by the bridge. Associated with each vehicle is the maximum speed with which it can travel over the bridge. The time taken by a group of vehicles is calculated as the time taken by the slowest vehicle in the group to cross the bridge.

<P>An aerial photograph represents a square portion of an islandÂ’s vegetation as a positive integer matrix.
 Each number in the matrix corresponds to a square subsection of the total area and contains relevant 
information about the plants that inhabit that particular place. For example, plant species that are 
unique to the island are represented with prime numbers, while species that can be found elsewhere 
are represented with non-prime numbers. The Botanical Institute of the island wants to divide the area 
into regions that have unique vegetation, and those that do not. To accomplish this task, the Institute 
has requested you to analyze the supplied information and determine the number of different regions
 that exist and their sizes. Two subsections belong to the same region if they lie contiguously on 
the same row or column, and if they both are either prime or non-prime. </p>

<P>In this problem you will be given a map of a rectangular maze with square blocks. From each block you can move in four directions (N, E, W, S) and you lose some energy for every walk from one block to an adjacent one. Some blocks of the maze are really blocked - that is you cannot move to those blocks. Some other blocks contain some treasures that you will have to collect. Each treasure has a particular pickup cost and carrying cost associated with it. The pickup cost is the energy required to pick up the treasure from the floor and the carrying cost is the energy required to carry the treasure from one block to an adjacent one.

Mr. Richards, an enthusiastic mathematician, is spending his holiday in Shanghai.  He is so crazy 
about his study that he may associate anything with mathematical problems.  According to his 
schedule,  he should visit the Museum today.  But after getting up, he was in a daze in the hotel, 
thinking deeply about a coloration problem.  Yesterday, when he took a walk in the nightfall, the 
slabs of stone paved on the piazza fascinated him.  He has associated  those stones with a 
combinatorial problem. 

<P>
The shape of those slabs of stone is equilateral triangle whose side length is 1 meter.  But if Mr. 
Richards arranges 4 slabs of stone, as Fig.1 below shows, those stones may form a larger 
equilateral triangle whose side length is 2 meters.  He designates those stones with the numbers 1 
to 4 first, then he tries to use three different colors  -  blue, green and red  -  to color those stones.  
In such a triangle, the contiguous stones are required not to be painted with the same color.  He 
asks himself to find out the number of the coloration methods.  Since he is a learned person in 
combinatorial theory, it's not a difficult problem for him.  Soon he works out the answer, 24.  
You know, because of the marks on those stones, they should not be regarded as the same ones.

<P>
Arranging for more slabs of stone to form a larger triangle, and using more colors, the coloration 
problem will be much more complex.  For example, arranging 9 slabs of stone, as Fig.2 below 
shows, Mr. Richards has to form a triangle whose side length is 3 meters.  Using 5 colors to paint 
on those stones, the answer will be an enormous number.  Without a computer, he could not tell 
the result exactly, although he knows clearly how to account the coloration methods.  So you are 
required to write a program to tell him the exact answer.

In such a demanding age, after working busily day after day, undoubtedly people would expect to 
enjoy their leisure time.  What do they want to do first?  It's the trip.  Nowadays, in the eyes of 
a traveler who hopes to visit tourist attractions all over the country, the world is wonderful.  
Since there are so many travel agencies, if he wants to participate in an organized trip, he may 
choose any of them.  But for a travel agency, the competition seems to be much more ruthless, 
for he has so many rivals in scrambling for the tourists. 

<P>
Company trip center is one of those unfortunate travel agencies.  After investigating from the 
questionnaires, the agent has found out that there are some tourists who do not get along with each 
other, so he has to choose some of them to organize a trip group.  But he had made many 
mistakes in choosing those members before, and they caused many of his customers shift to his 
rivals.  Although he could not tell exactly how many rivals he has, he knows clearly that his 
profits have diminished terribly.  So he decides to take action to change the situation. 

<P>
Company trip center pays attention to that problem at the beginning.  Initially the agent does not 
know what tourists do not like each other, but after discussing with those tourists, he is able to 
acquire the information.  So he will be able to form a trip group from some of those tourists in 
which no one is unwilling to get along with others.  If company A could make a wise decision, 
there will be maximum number of tourists in this group,  which will undoubtedly bring the biggest 
profits to him.  What a great idea, isn't it? 

<P>
You are required to write a program for company trip center to solve the problem.  The solution 
will exist for sure.  After writing such a program, you will get an acknowledgement from him.

A value of 0 for the integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> indicates the end of input, and this test case should not be processed.  
Each line in the following  <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> lines contains n characters without any separators.  Each character 
should be either ``1" or ``0", no characters else will appear in the input file.  The character ``1" 
means that the two tourists could not get along well with each other, so you shouldn't arrange 
them in one trip group.  And the character ``0" means they will make no difficulty to join the 
same group.  For example, if the 2nd characte r in the 1st line is ``1", the trip group may comprise 
either the 1st tourist or the 2nd tourist, if the character is ``0", the trip group may comprise both of 
them.

<B>Assumption:</B> Obviously, a tourist could not be unwilling to get along with himself.  So you may 
assume the corresponding character will always be ``0".  If a tourist does not wish to get along

<P>Mr. White, a fat man, now is crazy about a game named ``Dance, Dance, Revolution". But his dance skill is so poor that he could not dance a dance, even if he dances arduously every time. Does ``DDR" just mean him a perfect method to squander his pounds? No way. He still expects that he will be regarded as ``Terpsichorean White" one day. So he is considering writing a program to plan the movement sequence of his feet, so that he may save his strength on dancing. Now he looks forward to dancing easily instead of sweatily.<P>``DDR" is a dancing game that requires the dancer to use his feet to tread on the points according to the direction sequence in the game. There are one central point and four side points in the game. Those side points are classified as top, left, bottom and right. For the sake of explanation, we mark them integers. That is, the central point is 0, the top is 1, the left is 2, the bottom is 3, and the right is 4, as the figure below shows:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="218" HEIGHT="227" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/2031img1.png ALT="\epsfbox{p2031.eps}"></DIV><P>At the beginning the dancer's two feet stay on the central point. According to the direction sequence, the dancer has to move one of his feet to the special points. For example, if the sequence requires him to move to the top point at first, he may move either of his feet from point 0 to point 1 (<SPAN CLASS="textit">Note: Not both of his feet</SPAN>). Also, if the sequence then requires him to move to the bottom point, he may move either of his feet to point 3, regardless whether to use the foot that stays on point 0 or the one that stays on point 1.<P>There is a strange rule in the game: moving both of his feet to the same point is not allowed. For instance, if the sequence requires the dancer to the bottom point and one of his feet already sta ys on point 3, he should stay the very foot on the same point and tread again, instead of moving the other one to point 3.<P>After dancing for a long time, Mr. White can calculate how much strength will be consumed when he moves from one point to another. Moving one of his feet from the central point to any side points will consume 2 units of his strength. Moving from one side point to another adjacent side point will consume 3 units, such as from the top point to the left point. Moving from one side point to the opposite side point will consume 4 units, such as from the top point to the bottom point. Yet, if he stays on the same point and tread again, he will use 1 unit.<P>Assume that the sequence requires Mr. White to move to point <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1 <IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/2031img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"> 2 <IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/2031img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"> 2 <IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/2031img1.png ALT="$ \rightarrow$"> 4</SPAN>.

In this couple of integers, the former number represents the point of his left foot, and the latter represents the point of his right foot. In this way, he has to consume 8 units of his strength.

The 8 units of strength is the least cost.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input file will consist of a series of direction sequences.

Since ancient time, people have been dreaming of flying in the sky.  Eventually, the dream was 
realized in the 20th century.  Nowadays, the airplane  becomes a useful vehicle that is used 
frequently in our daily life. 

<P>
But before the dream came true, a large number of people had tried to design the aircrafts.  One 
of those aircrafts, which is called ``helicopter" in modern time, can be traced back to the blueprint 
of the aircraft designed by Leonardo da Vinci.  But the helicopter was not effective enough till 
this century. 

<P>
Since the helicopter rises through the updraft generated by the airscrew, it is very important for it 
to keep balance.  Even for the late-model helicopters, the loads are required to be distributed 
evenly, so that the center of gravity of the helicopter lies just underneath the airscrew.  It is one of 
the most important requirements for it in flight. 

<P>
Now, you are requested by an airline company to write a program for a passenger transport 
helicopter.  The program may arrange a seat for each passenger automatically so that the center 
of gravity of the helicopter should be located underneath the airscrew as dose as possible.  The 
seats in the helicopter and the airscrew are designed as the figure below. 

<P>

</DIV>

<P>
You may assume the distance of the adjoining seats is 1 unit, and the airscrew occupies a seat.  A 
seat along with a passenger on it will generate a transverse mome nt and a longitudinal moment.  
The transverse moment, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Mv</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>, is the weight of a passenger on the seat multiplied by the transverse 
distance from the seat to the airscrew.  The longitudinal moment,  <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Mh</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>, is the weight of a 
passenger on the seat multiplied by the longitudinal distance.  If the transverse moments 
generated by the passengers on the left are assumed to be positive, the moments by the passengers 
on the right will be negative.  Also, if the longitudinal moments generated by the passengers in 
front are assumed to be positive, the moments by the passengers on the back will be negative.  
That is, the moments may counteract with each other.  You may use the formula below to figure 
out the composition of moments. 

<P>

A Card in the battle area will be turn over if its value on side adjacent to new card is less than new card's value on side adjacent to it. That is, the card's color will be changed, and it will belong to the other player. For example, as the figure shows, assume a red card has been placed on the battle area, and a blue one is now placed on the area adjacent to the right side of the red one. Since the value of the left side of the old card is 2, and the value of the right side of the new card is 7, the red card will be turned over to be a blue one, and it belongs to the blue player. When all 9 areas are filled, the outcome of the game is judged. If the player who put first card has 5 cards in battle area, it's a tie. If he has more cards, he wins the game.

<P>
Bob enjoys playing computer games, especially strategic games, but sometimes he cannot find the solution fast
enough and then he is very sad. Now he has the following problem. He must defend a medieval city, the roads of
which form a tree. He has to put the minimum number of soldiers on the nodes so that they can observe all the
edges. Can you help him?

<p>
Your program should find the minimum number of soldiers that Bob has to put for a given tree.

<p>
For example for the tree:
<p align=center><img src=p2038a.gif>
<p>
the solution is one soldier (at the node 1). 
<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input file contains several data sets in text format. Each data set represents a tree with the following description:
<blockquote>
	<li>the number of nodes
	<li>the description of each node in the following format:<br>
<blockquote>
<i>	node_identifier:(number_of_roads) node_identifier1 node_identifier2 Â… node_identifiernumber_of_roads</i><br>
	or<br>
<i>	node_identifier:(0)</i>

The relation Â“romantically involvedÂ” is defined between one girl and one boy. For the study reasons it is

have been Â“romantically involvedÂ”. The result of the program is the number of students in such a set.

Write a program that performs symbolic derivation <i>fÂ’(x) = df(x)/dx</i> of a given function <i>f(x)</i>. The function <i>f(x)</i>
is defined by an expression which may contain the following operations: + (addition), - (subtraction), *
(multiplication), / (division), and ln (natural logarithm). Besides, the operands may be the variable x and
numerical constants. The expression may contain arbitrarily nested sub-expressions in parentheses ( ).

<p>
The expression is given in a usual, infix form, such as:

<p align=center>
(2*ln(x+1.7)-x*x)/((-7)+3.2*x*x)+(x+3*x)*x

<p>
Numerical constants have the form d.d, with an optional sign (+ or -), where the number of digits both in integer
and decimal parts are arbitrary. The input expression is guaranteed to be correct (no syntax error can occur).

<p>
The output expression should be written in infix form. It should not be optimized for human reading. This means,
it can contain redundancies, such as 0*x, 1*x, 0+x, etc. The derivation should be performed using the following
rules:

<blockquote>
	<li>The operators * and / are of higher priority than the operators + and -. Parentheses may change
	the priorities as usually.
	<li>The operators +, -, *, and / are left-associative, meaning that they group from left to right:<br>
<pre>		a*b*c = (a*b)*c, a/b/c = (a/b)/c, a/b*c = (a/b)*c, etc.</pre>
	<li>The rules for derivation are:
	<pre>
		(a + b)' = a' + b'
		(a - b)' = a' - b'
		(a * b)' = (a' * b + a * b')
		(a / b)' = (a' * b - a * b') / b^2
			(Note: use b^2 and not (b*b) for presentation)
		ln(a)' = (a')/(a)
		x' = 1
		const' = 0
	</pre>
	<li>While producing the symbolic derivation, use parentheses for output strictly as stated in the
	previous rule. Do not perform presentation optimizations, such as 0*a = 0, 1*a = a, etc.

Write a program that takes as input a rooted tree and a list of pairs of vertices. For each pair
(u,v) the program determines the closest common ancestor of u and v in the tree. The closest common
ancestor of two nodes u and v is the node w that is an ancestor of both u and v and has the greatest
depth in the tree. A node can be its own ancestor (for example in Figure 1 the ancestors of node 2 are 2 and 5).

<P>Complex numbers can be useful in manycontext. Here wewould like to perform complex arithmetic and evaluate an expression containing complex numbers. Each simple complex number is of the form <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I> + <I>bi</I></SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I> - <I>bi</I></SPAN>, or simply <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>bi</I></SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN> are positive integers. Thus <SPAN CLASS="MATH">- <I>a</I> + <I>bi</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">- <I>a</I> - <I>bi</I></SPAN> are illegal forms. There are five operators in complex expressions: ``+", ``-", ``*", ``/" and ``%", where ``%" is a unary postfix operator meaning conjugate. In other words, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>a</I> + <I>bi</I>)% = <I>a</I> - <I>bi</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>a</I> - <I>bi</I>)% = <I>a</I> + <I>b</I></SPAN>i. There is no unary minus operator.<P>In this problem, the precedence rules of the operators are <SPAN CLASS="textit">slightly different</SPAN> from those in common sense. In particular, the conjugate operator ``%" will take the highest precedence. Both ``+" and ``-" will take the next precedence. Finally, ``*" and ``/" will take the lowest precedence. Operators with the same precedence are evaluated in a left-to-right order. In other words, subexpressions within brackets will be evaluated first. The conjugate will be evaluated before ``+" and ``-", which again will be evaluated before ``*" and ``/". Each expression will be terminated by the ``=" operator that will force the expression to be evaluated.<P>Operands to the expressions can be either a positive number or a simple complex number, but not ``complicated" complex numbers. It is possible that during evaluation of division, complex numbers that are not simple may be resulted. In this application, you are required to express ``complicated" complex numbers in the form of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[<I>a</I> + <I>bi</I>]/<I>r</I></SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[<I>a</I> - <I>bi</I>]/<I>r</I></SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN> are non-negative integers and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I></SPAN> is a non-zero integer (may be negative).

Johnny is the manager of a moving company. As business is improving by the days and
Johnny would like to optimize the operations and profits of the company, he decides to
automate manpower planning and scheduling. The main factors to consider in such a
planning exercise include what major furniture items are to be moved and the manpower
requirement(suchasnumber of movers) to moveeach of such items. Johnny's customers
are usually corporate clients who are demanding and always liketohave the moving job
completed within a certain amount of time. Johnny comes to you for help for such a
planning and scheduling system.

<P>
Write a program to read in a sequence of job descriptions from a standard input file.
Each job description consists of:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>the maximum time allowed for moving all items,
</LI>
<LI>the number of major furniture items, followed by
</LI>
<LI>a list of records, one for each of the major furniture items to move and each on a separate line.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Each record contains three fields:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>the name(atmost30characters long) of the item,
</LI>
<LI>how long it takes to move the item, and
</LI>
<LI>the number of movers required for moving the item.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Time is specified in minutes.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Each job description should generate the following output:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A line printing ``<TT>Job description:</TT>".
</LI>
<LI>The job description:

<UL>
<LI>One line is output for each major furniture item, its time requirement, and
manpower requirement, separated by commas. Each line is enclosed by a pair
of square brackets.
</LI>
<LI>The sequence of furniture items should be ordered in exactly the same way
that they are read in.
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>A line with ``<TT>Number of movers required: </TT>" followed by the minimum number of
movers required to satisfy all the timing and manpower requirement constraints.
</LI>
<LI>All possible schedules for moving each of the major furniture items, specifying the
start times for each item.
</LI>
</UL>

</H2>

<P>
Each schedule consists of a sequence of start times on one line. The times should
be enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas. Each start time is for each
furniture item. The start times should be printed in the exact order that the items are
read in. The time should be in the number of minutes since the start of the moving job
(at time 0).

<P>
Note that the many possible schedules of a job must be ordered ascendingly according
to the lexicographical ordering defined as follows. We consider a schedule for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> items to
be a string of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> integers

The sample input specifies two jobs. The first job must be completed within
an hour and consists of four major furniture pieces. The first piece is a piano requiring
thirty minutes and three movers to move. The other items can be interpreted similarly.
The second specification begins immediately after the first specification. The second job
is very similar to the first job except for a slight difference in manpower requirement for
the table.

<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
Output for different jobs should be separated by a blank line. The job output should
also be ordered in exactly the same way that they are specified in the input file. The
output should be printed to the standard output file.

<P>
You can safely assume that all items can be moved at the same time if enough manpower 
is assigned. You also need to consider only jobs with at most ten furniture items.
Each job spans across at most one hour. Each furniture item requires at least one mover.

<P>
The output format up to the schedules for each job is pretty straight forward. For
space reason, we cannot give you all the possible schedules, but they must respect the
same lexicographical ordering defined above. For example, in the first schedule of the first
job, it means that the piano should be handled at the beginning of the move, the chair
and the table both after 30 minutes, and the bed after 45 minutes. The first schedule of
the first job is lexicographically less than the second schedule of the same job since

<P>

<UL>
<LI>they are equal in the first start time, and
</LI>
<LI>the second start time (30) of the first schedule is less than that (31) of the second
schedule.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
This lexicographical ordering is maintained for all schedules of both the first and
second jobs. Note that a blank line is printed between the output of the first job and
that of the second job.

<P>
You can safely assume that there are at least one item to move in each moving job,
and that all job specifications are doable when given enough manpower resources. Your
program should also run with reasonable eficiency.

Therefore if a network requires more than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> Network Watchers, we have to use other means to monitor the communication lines. Your task is to determine if a given network requires at most <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> Network Watchers to monitor all communication lines; if so, find at most <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> sites to install Network Watchers to monitor all communication lines in the network.

<P>His Excellency the ambassador of Puzzlestan to Tehran is giving a reception (party) on the occasion of Puzzlestan national day on the second of November. Ambassadors of all missions to Tehran are invited. At the entrance to reception hall each guest leaves his belongings (overcoat, hat, ..., which we will call items afterwards) with the attendant who knows the host ambassador loves puzzle games. While waiting for the reception to end, the attendant prepares a program on his laptop that helps him find what belongs to whom. He asks each guest to give some statements that:</p><blockquote><li>Relates two items belonging to the same guest. <li>Indicates two items that do not belong to the same guest.</blockquote><p>Suppose there are N kinds of items and M guests, and assume each guest has exactly one item from each kind (i.e. each guest has one overcoat, one hat, ...). Each of N x M items is given a unique name, which is a single letter (case-sensitive). We can then represent all items of kind i (1 &le; i &le; N) by a string of length M. We call this, ith group. For example, ith group can be ABCD. In this case, its first item is A, its second item is B, and so on.</p><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>The first line includes the number of test cases (at most 20).

In each of the next N lines, there is one string of length M, representing one group (different items of the same kind). The rest of the input includes several lines of statements. Each statement is of form i j X k r, which means that the jth item of the ith group and the rth item of the kth group belong to the same guest (if X is R) or do not belong to the same guest (if X is N).

<P>DDL is a very simple programming language in which variables are dynamically declared at run time. All variables in DDL are of the signed integer type within the range -9999...9999. There are up to five types of statements in a DDL program (each statement is in a separate program line, and the first statement is in line 1):</p>1. Dcl &lt;id><blockquote>Dcl is a keyword specifying a declaration statement. id is a single (case-sensitive) letter designating a DDL variable. For example Dcl x when executed correctly, allocates memory for variable x, and sets its value to zero.</blockquote>2. &lt;id> = &lt;ic><blockquote>This is an assignment statement, where id is a DDL variable, and ic is a literal integer constant in the range (0...9999). For example x = 2000 when executed correctly, changes value of x to 2000. Note that there may be one or more number of blank characters around =, but there is no tab characters.</blockquote>3. Goto &lt;label>, or Goto &lt;id> &lt;label><blockquote>Goto is a keyword specifying an unconditional or conditional goto statement. label is a program line's number. For example Goto 5 transfers the program execution flow to line 5 of the program, and Goto x 5 when executed correctly, trasfers the flow to line 5 iff x>0, and to the next line otherwise. The label is guaranteed to be in the range of program line numbers.</blockquote>4.Inc &lt;id>, or Dec &lt;id><blockquote>Inc and Dec are keywords specifying increment and decrement statements respectively. For example Inc x (Dec y) when executed correctly adds (substracts) 1 to (from) the value of x (y).</blockquote>5. End<blockquote>End is a keyword specifying the end statement, whose execution stops the program.</blockquote><p>Note that the keywords of the DDL language are case-insensitive.</p><p><b>Error conditions:</b></p><p>When one of the following erroneous statements encounters during the program execution, an error message appears in a separate line of the output. Each error message is of the form &lt;label> &lt;space> &lt;error code>. label is the line number for the erroneous statement, space is one blank character, and error code is a positive integer specified below.</p><blockquote>1. Dcl x is erroneous if x has not been referenced (used in assignment, goto, increment or decrement) since the last time a Dcl x (declaring the same variable) statement has been executed, unless this is the first Dcl x statement being executed. In this erroneous condition, an error message indicating a repeated declaration is generated as &lt;label> 1, where label is the program line number for the erroneous statement. Then the program flow transfers to the statement in the next program line, and any prior correctly executed declaration for x is valid.<br><br>2.Any other statement where a variable such as x is referenced (used in assignment, goto, increment or decrement) is erroneous if no Dcl x has been previously correctly executed. In this case, an error message indicating an undeclared reference is generated as &lt;label> 2 and the program execution continues from the next line.</blockquote><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>First line of the input file contains a single integer N indicating the number of DDL programs to follow (1 &le; N &le; 20).

<P>A company producing toys has a complex system to paint its products. To obtain the desired color, the product must be painted by several colors in a specified order. A product is painted by moving through color tunnels. For each color there is at least one tunnel that paints with that color, but there may be more. The tunnels are distributed in the painting area and the product must be delivered from one tunnel to another in order to be painted with the given colors. The product is at a certain point in the production plant when painting process starts and must finally be delivered to the product warehouse.</p><p>More formally, a finished uncolored product is at a certain given point (source point) and must be delivered to another given point (destination point) after being painted with different colors in a given order. There are several tunnels, each is assumed to be a line segment in the plain with a specific color. The colors of the tunnels are not necessarily distinct.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let &lt;<i>c</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>c</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., <i>c<sub>n</sub></i>&gt; be the sequence of <i>n</i> colors that the product is to be painted with. The product is required to pass through tunnels&nbsp; &lt;<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, ... <i>t<sub>n</sub></i>&gt; such that the color of <i>t<sub>i</sub></i> is <i>c<sub>i</sub></i>. Note that it is possible to pass through a tunnel without being painted, so the mentioned &lt;<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, ... <i>t<sub>n</sub></i>&gt; may be in fact a subsequence of the tunnels which the product passes through. The direction in which the product passes a tunnel is not important. The goal is to find the shortest path from source to destination subject to the color constraints. The path may cross itself, or even cross a tunnel. Passing twice (or more) through a tunnel is also allowed. Note that two tunnels can cross or overlap but are different.</p><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>The input file contains several test cases.

The camera has special software to detect cities and roads from an image, and is also able to detect every region (which is a connected part of surface), bounded by a series of connected roads with no other region inside. Using this technology, the satellite is able to compress the picture before sending it. The compressed format of a picture is the city locations and its regions.</p><p>Discovery has launched the satellite, without testing the software completely. So, after a while, they received some buggy pictures which includes one more extra region: the outer region.

<p>A supermarket in Tehran is open 24 hours a day every day 
and needs a number of cashiers to fit its need.&nbsp; The supermarket manager has 
hired you to help him, solve his problem. The problem is that the supermarket 
needs different number of cashiers at different times of each day (for example, 
a few cashiers after midnight, and many in the afternoon) to provide good 
service to its customers, and he wants to hire the least number of cashiers for 
this job.</p>

<p>The manager has provided you with the least number of 
cashiers needed for every one-hour slot of the day. This data is given as <i>R</i>(0),
<i>R</i>(1), ..., <i>R</i>(23): <i>R</i>(0) represents the least number of 
cashiers needed from midnight to 1:00 A.M., <i>R</i>(1) shows this number for 
duration of 1:00 A.M. to 2:00 A.M., and so on. Note that these numbers are the 
same every day. There are <i>N</i> qualified applicants for this job. Each 
applicant <i>i</i> works non-stop once each 24 hours in a shift of exactly 8 
hours starting from a specified hour, say <i>t<sub>i</sub></i> (0
&le; <i>t<sub>i</sub></i>
&le; 23), exactly from the start of the 
hour mentioned. That is, if the <i>i</i>th applicant is hired, he/she will work 
starting from <i>t<sub>i</sub></i> oÂ’clock sharp for 8 hours. Cashiers do not 
replace one another and work exactly as scheduled, and there are enough cash

<P>It's now 3002 and the Godfather Unlucky Luchiano is planning a rubbery from the Rectilinia museum.
 The problem is that the walls of the museum are impenetrable and the doors are guarded so his men
 cannot enter the museum from its doors. He is lucky that the museum has no roofs and one can enter
 the museum from the above. So he decides to use a device from thousands of years ago; a catapult!
 Using this, his men can fly and fall in some place in the museum without being caught by guards.</p>

<p>But another problem still exists which is a high-tech laser gun that guards the museum. The laser gun 
is designed based on a very recent discovery that it is possible to guide the laser beam not on a straight
 line, but on a rectilinear path. The fact that the beam travels the shortest (possible) distance from
 the emission point to a target still remains. The problem is that if one land somewhere in the museum 
that is reachable by the laser beams, he will be immediately destroyed. Again godfather is lucky,
 since in the museum, there are some walls and other obstacles through which the beam cannot pass and 
if his men can land in the shadows of that walls, they are safe in the way that they are not destroyed
 by the gun right after landing and they can use their special device to disable the laser gun. As
 the catapult is not a very precise device, godfather wants to know the probability of landing in
shadows, so he has to compute the total area of shadowy regions of the museum.</p>

<p>Given the layout of the museum, you have to write a program to compute the total area of the 
shadowy regions. Yes! This time you really HAVE TO!</p>

<p>As you study the layout of the museum from the top view, you find that the museum can be 
considered as a rectangle with some obstacles in it. The obstacles are simple polygons with 
sides parallel to the rectangle sides. Interior of obstacles do not overlap. The laser gun is 
located in the upper-right corner of the museum. A laser beam is composed of a number of line
 segments; each is either horizontal or vertical. When the gun chooses its target, it intelligently 
determines a possible path to the target and fires. A possible path has the following characteristics:</p>

<blockquote>
	<li>It consists of only horizontal and vertical segments.
	<li>It never crosses an obstacle but in some parts may be tangent to obstacle sides. It can never be tangent to two obstacle sides at one point.
	<li>In the travel from the gun to the target, the beam never moves from left to right or from bottom to top (directions are relative to view of the museum from the above).
</blockquote>

<p align=center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2060.gif></p>

<p>The problem is to compute the total area of the shadowy regions in the museum (not belonging to the
 interior of the obstacles), where the laser gun cannot shoot any point inside those regions. In the above
 figure, the point marked by (x) is in a shadowy region (see sample input).</p>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<p>The input file contains several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (between 1
 and 10), which is the number of test cases. Rest of the input file contains t test cases. The first 
line of each test case contains 2 positive integers, which are the length and the width of the rectangle
 respectively. The second line contains a single integer n, which is the number of obstacles in the museum
 (between 0 and 50). After it, there are n lines, which contain the obstacle data. Each obstacle data is
 in a single line, which begins with an integer m, which is the number of vertices of the obstacle (between
 4 and 50), followed by 2m numbers, which are the x, and y coordinates of the vertices listed in clockwise
 order. Every coordinate in the input is a positive integer less than 1,000,000. Upper-left corner of the
 rectangle is the coordinate origin.</p>

<P>Password security is a tricky thing. Users prefer simple passwords that are easy to remember (like buddy), but such passwords are often insecure. Some sites use random computer-generated passwords (like xvtpzyo), but users have a hard time remembering them and sometimes leave them written on notes stuck to their computer. One potential solution is to generate &quot;pronounceable&quot; passwords that are relatively secure but still easy to remember.<P>FnordCom is developing such a password generator. You work in the quality control department, and it's your job to test the generator and make sure that the passwords are acceptable. To be acceptable, a password must satisfy these three rules:<ol><li>It must contain at least one vowel. </li><li>It cannot contain three consecutive vowels or three consecutive consonants. </li><li>It cannot contain two consecutive occurrences of the same letter, except for '<tt>ee</tt>' or '<tt>oo</tt>'.</li></ol><p>(For the purposes of this problem, the vowels are '<tt>a</tt>', '<tt>e</tt>', '<tt>i</tt>', '<tt>o</tt>', and '<tt>u</tt>'; all other letters are consonants.) Note that these rules are not perfect; there are many common/pronounceable words that are not acceptable.</p><p><b><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><A name=SECTION0001003000000000000000>Input</A> </FONT></b></p><p>The input consists of one or more potential passwords, one per line, followed by a line containing only the word '<tt>end</tt>' that signals the end of the file.

<p>A simple matching game for children uses a board that is a sequence of colored squares. Each player has a game piece. Players alternate turns, drawing cards containing either one colored square or two colored squares of the same color. Players move their pieces forward on the board to the next square that matches the single color on the card, or forward to the second matching square if the card contains two colored squares, or forward to the last square on the board if there is no square matching the description above. A player wins if his piece lands on the last square of the board. It is possible for all the cards to be drawn and still not have a winner.</p><p>This problem represents colors with capital letters from A-Z.

<p>IONU Satellite Imaging, Inc. records and stores very large images using run 
length encoding. You are to write a program that reads a compressed image, finds 
the edges in the image, as described below, and outputs another compressed image 
of the detected edges.<br>
<br>
A simple edge detection algorithm sets an output pixel's value to be the maximum 
absolute value of the differences between it and all its surrounding pixels in 
the input image. Consider the input image below:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2065_1.gif width="295" height="273"><img border="0" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2065_1.gif width="295" height="273"></p>
<p>The upper left pixel in the output image is the maximum of the values 
|15-15|, |15-100|, and |15-100|, which is 85. The pixel in the 4th row, 2nd 
column is computed as the maximum of |175-100|, |175-100|, |175-100|, |175-175|, 
|175-25|, |175-175|, |175-175|, and |175-25|, which is 150. </p>
<p>Images contain 2 to 1,000,000,000 (10<sup>9</sup>) pixels. All images are 
encoded using run length encoding (RLE). This is a sequence of pairs, containing 
pixel value (0-255) and run length (1-10<sup>9</sup>). Input images have at most 
1,000 of these pairs. Successive pairs have different pixel values. All lines in 
an image contain the same number of pixels.</p>


<p><b><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><A name=SECTION0001003000000000000000>Input</A></FONT></b></p>
<p>Input consists of information for one or more images. Each image starts with 
the width, in pixels, of each image line. This is followed by the RLE pairs, one 
pair per line. A line with 0 0 indicates the end of the data for that image. An 
image width of 0 indicates there are no more images to process. The first image 
in the example input encodes the 5x7 input image above.<br>
<br>


<p><b><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><A name=SECTION0001003000000000000000>Output</A> 
</FONT></b></p>
Output is a series of edge-detected images, in the same format as the input 
images, except that there may be more than 1,000 RLE pairs.<br>
<br>
<b>Important Note</b>: A brute force solution that attempts to compute an output 
value for every individual pixel will likely fail due to space or time 
constraints.</p>

<P>Instruens Fabulam means drawing a chart (or table) in Latin. That's what you 
will do for this problem.. 


<h2><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><A name=SECTION0001004000000000000000>Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT> </h2>
<P>The input consists of one or more table descriptions, followed by a line 
whose first character is '*', which signals the end of the file. Each 
description begins with a header line containing one or more characters that 
define the number and alignment of columns in the table. Each character in the 
header line is either '&lt;', '=', or '&gt;', and indicates a left-justified, 
centered, or right-justified column. Following the header are at least two and 
at most 21 data lines that contain the entries for each row. Each data line 
consists of one or more nonempty entries separated by an ampersand ('&amp;'), where 
the number of entries is equal to the number of columns defined in the header 
line. The first data line contains entries for the column titles, and the remaining data lines contain entries for the body of the table. Spaces may 
appear within an entry, but never at the beginning or end of an entry. The 
characters '&lt;', '=', '&gt;', '&amp;', and '*' will not appear in the input except where 
indicated above. 


<h2><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><A name=SECTION0001004000000000000000>Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT> </h2><P>For each table description, output the table using the exact format shown in 
the examples. Note that 
<ul>
  <li>The total width of the table will never exceed 79 characters (not counting 
  end-of-line).</li>
  <li>Dashes ('<tt>-</tt>') are used to draw horizontal lines, not underscores 
  ('<tt>_</tt>'). 'At' signs ('<tt>@</tt>') appear at each of the four outer 
  corners. Plus signs ('<tt>+</tt>') appear at intersections <em>within</em> the 
  line separating the title from the body. </li>
  <li>The largest entry in a column is always separated from the enclosing bars 
  ('<tt>|</tt>') by exactly one space. </li>
  <li>If a centered entry cannot be <em>exactly</em> centered within a column, 
  the extra space goes on the right of the entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Input and correct output files satisfy all the requirements listed in <i>
Notes to Teams</i>, <b>except</b> that the output may contain two or more 
consecutive spaces. There are no spaces at the beginning or end of lines, and 
only spaces are used (never tabs).</p>

A group of ACMers designed a variation, and a much simpler one at that, of the popular game TARGET to help them relax while waiting for the judges' declaration of the final scores. The game consists of finding words that satisfy certain criterion (e.g., start with ``dog" (``dogma") or contain ``cat" (``scatological"), used in the news today (``nuclear"), etc). 

<P>
For this game the group agreed that longer words are more worthy than short words and unusual words are better than common words, where commonness is defined as the number of participants who all think of the same word. The score for a word is calculated as its number of letters divided by the number of participants choosing it. Examples are: the word ``<SPAN ID="txt48">direkt</SPAN>" chosen by a single German participant scores ``6" points for her, and the word ``<SPAN ID="txt49">directly</SPAN>" chosen by three participants scores only ``8/3" for each of them. 

<P>
The total score for each participant is the sum of his/her individual word scores. The group has also set some rules for the game: 

<P>

<OL>
<LI>the number of participants to be between two (2) and nine (9), 
</LI>
<LI>the number of words chosen by a participant to have a maximum of nine (9) words, 
</LI>
<LI>each of the words, which naturally has at least one letter, to have a maximum of twenty (20) letters, and 
</LI>
<LI>the length of the name that a participant chooses for himself/herself to be between one (1) and ten (10) letters. 
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Your task is to write a program that processes several lists of words, one for each participant, and determines the winner. You do not have to worry about checking the validity of the words against the criterion. The participants will perform this task as part of learning new and foreign words.

<P>Chip and Dale have devised an encryption method to hide their messages. They first agree secretly on a number that will be used as the number of columns in a matrix. The sender prepares an intermediate format by removing capitalizations and punctuations and spaces from the message. The sender then enters the letters of the <SPAN ID="txt48">intermediate format</SPAN> along the diagonals of the matrix and pads with extra random letters so as to make a rectangular array of letters. For example, if the message is ``There's no place like my office on a muggy day" and there are five columns, Dale would write down<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TT>t h r n a<BR>e e o c k<BR>s p e e f<BR>l l m f o<BR>i y i n g<BR>o c a g a<BR>e m y y x<BR>u d x x x</TT></DIV><P><P><BR>Note how Dale includes only the letters and writes them all in lower case.

The manager of a packing warehouse, which specialises in packing breakable items, contracted a supplier for boxes of sizes from the Fibonacci sequence. I am not sure of the reason behind it, but it is rumoured to be related to the recent ``Da Vinci code" movie. An item whose size is in the sequence can be packed in a box of equal size with no filling, but an item whose size is not in the sequence must be packed with sufficient filling material to fill the box and protect the item from breaking. An item cannot be split between two boxes, and each item must be packed separately in its own box.

<P>
The second twist in this story, which makes it the more bizarre, is that the company only receives a daily filling material delivery of size <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>F</I></SPAN> to be used. At the end of each day, any unused filling material is discarded. 

<P>
Your task is to maximize the number of items shipped each day for a given amount of filling material <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>F</I></SPAN> and a given list of items.

The reading of ``Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions" by <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Edwin Abbott</SPAN> had a profound, and rather unusual, effect on young Bob and his mother too. Bob started to only use things that are either flat or with flat sides: Soup bowls, dishes, glasses, mugs, and even the cutlery. However the annoying part, for his mother that is, was the way he re-organized the cupboard. Bob removed all the shelves and drew a grid, with integer coordinates, (0 0) for the lower left corner and (1000 1000) for the upper right corner, on the back of the cupboard. Bob will always stack the crockery neatly on top of each other. Neatly means aligned with his grid, so that he can record the location of each item by four integers that describe the coordinates of its lower left corner and its upper right corner. For the example, the red mug (labelled with Zs) is described by the four integers (1 0 3 3).

<P>
Bob's mother will not move a crockery item unless no other item in the cupboard exists vertically above it. This way she can be sure that none of Bob's precious mugs/glasses gets broken. Examples are: taking the yellow mug (labelled with Xs) requires her to move the grey ``rectangular" soup bowl (labelled with Ss) first, and taking the grey mug (labelled with Ys) requires her to move four items first.

Your task is to write a program to calculate for Bob's mother the number of items she must move before she can remove the item of her choice.

Each of the given words may appear multiple times in the table more but no more than four (4) times. Each word may be oriented in any of the 8 possible directions. The aim is to locate the given words, which will be different to each other, with the added challenge that no two words may share a letter. A generated puzzle is ``soluble" if all the words can be found with no two words sharing a letter, and ``challenging" if at least one pair of the given words shares a letter in the table.

<P>
For the sake of saving development cost and reducing time-to-market, the company decided to use a tweaked version of their software to create the new puzzles and then reject those that are not suitable. Your task is to write a program to test the generated puzzles and to accept the ones that are both ``challenging" and ``soluble" and to reject all other puzzles. For the above example, your program should accept the generated puzzle and report ``<TT>YES</TT>" for being ``challenging" and ``<TT>YES</TT>" for being ``soluble".

Now that you are familiar with the chairlift, it is time to state the problem. Two friends, whom we shall
call Bob and Alice, are out for a day of skiing. They are just riding up in chair 56 and know that the lift
has 126 chairs. They also know that the ride from the loading station to the unloading station takes exactly
225.0 seconds. Bob asks Alice: "How much longer will the ride take?" Alice doesn't look at her watch. Instead,
she waits until their chair meets a downward bound empty chair, notes that the number of that chair is 71,
and replies: "We have 198.9 more seconds to go." (An upward bound chair and a downward bound chair "meet" when
they are exactly opposite each other (i.e., both chairs are equidistant from the top of the mountain). At the
instant shown in Figure 4, no two chairs meet, but very soon thereafter, chairs 6 and 7, as well as chairs 5
and 8, etc., would meet.)<BR>
Your program will carry out Alice's computations.

The first line of the input file will contain N, followed by T. The constraints on N were previously
stated. T (the time it takes to  ride from the loading station to the unloading station) is a floating
point number, measured in seconds, 200.0 <= T <= 999.9. The first line will be followed by one or more
additional lines of input. On each of these additional lines, there will be exactly two integer values
in the range 1..N, representing two distinct chairs. The first of these chairs is the upward bound chair
in which Bob and Alice are riding. The second chair is the downward bound chair they meet when Alice
announces the remaining time.

and the remaining time, for each pair of chairs in the input. Pay attention to all formatting details,
such as punctuation, upper/lower case letters, the alignment of certain words, blank spaces, and the

All books that were already on the reserve shelf must therefore be moved to the right, just enough to make room for the new book on the shelf. When a reserve book is checked out and subsequently returned, it is also put on the reserve shelf's left end, as if it were just being placed on reserve. What happens when the shelf is full? When a book is placed on reserve, or when a previously checked out reserve book is returned, and there is not enough room on the reserve bookshelf, then, starting at the right end, as many books (but no more) are removed from the reserve shelf (they are "taken off reserve") as needed in order to make room for the book to be put on the reserve bookshelf.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>The first line of the input file contains a single integer, the total available space on the reserve book shelf (when it is empty), measured in millimeters (1 inch equals about 25 millimeters).

<P>The Zhombi tribe populates an island in the South Pacific. The tribe consists of a number of clans (which are collections of related families). The tribe has a chief, and so does each clan.<P>When a tribal law is proposed, the voting members of each clan convene and vote on the proposal. In case of a tie, the clan chief (who is otherwise not a voting member) will break the tie.<P>After the clans have voted, the clan chiefs convene at the tribal headquarters to conduct the tribal level vote, which will determine whether the proposal passes. There each clan chief will cast a number of votes equal to the number of voting members of his/her tribe. Furthermore, <u>all</u> votes cast by one clan chief will be either in favor of the proposal or against the proposal, depending on how his/her clan voted. For example, if clan A has 28 voting members and voted in favor of the proposal, then clan A's chief will cast all 28 votes in favor of the proposal at the tribal level, even if the vote at the clan level was "15 for 13 against", or if the vote at the clan level was a 14:14 tie that the clan chief chose to break in favor of the proposal. In case of a tie at the tribal level vote, the tribal chief (who is otherwise not a voting member) will break the tie.<P>You probably suspect now that a proposal could pass at the tribal level even if fewer than 50% of all votes were cast in its favor at the clan level.

<P>Floating point numbers are represented at the hardware level of most computer systems in <u>normalized binary scientific notation</u>. We will consider a hypothetical computer in which floating point numbers are represented in a 16-bit word. An example is shown in Figure 1:<P><center><IMG SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2080a.gif></center><P>In the common Intel chips, the exponent of a float has 8 bits and the mantissa has 23 bits, otherwise the representation is the same as in Figure 1.<P>We will show that this particular example represents the number whose usual decimal representation is -10.375.<p>The leftmost bit (the sign bit) is 1 if the floating point number is negative, 0 otherwise.<p>The next seven bits (<b>1000010</b> in this example) represent the Exponent component of the normalized binary scientific notation. The following two operations will reveal the exponent's actual value:<blockquote><li>Evaluate the binary number <b>1000010</b>: it is <b>1</b>*64+<b>0</b>*32+<b>0</b>*16+<b>0</b>*8+<b>0</b>*4+<b>1</b>*2+<b>0</b>*1 = 66.<br><li>Subtract the bias correction 63 from 66, which yields 3 as the actual value of the exponent that we will use below (the purpose of the bias correction is to allow negative exponents. As long as the exponent has seven bits, which will always be the case in this program, the bias correction is 63 = 2<sup>7-1</sup> - 1).</blockquote><p>The remaining 8 bits (01001100 in this example) constitute the mantissa, which is the fractional part of the normalized binary scientific notation. You will see in the next step how it is used.<p>The sign bit, the mantissa, and the exponent are used to calculate the value of the floating point number:<P><center><IMG SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2080a.gif></center><P><blockquote><li>The period preceding the mantissa is the "binary point" which has the same meaning as the decimal point in a decimal (base ten) representation. <li>In the normalized binary scientific notation there is only one binary digit preceding the binary point, and it is always 1 (except if the floating point number is the number zero). It is called the characteristic. Since it is always 1, it does not explicitly appear in the 16-bit representation of Figure 1.</blockquote><p>Since the number 1.01001100 is in binary, the digits to the right of the binary point represent successive negative powers of 2. Therefore, the number shown in Figure 2 can be re-written as:<P><center><IMG SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2080a.gif></center><p>Here the result has been expressed using scientific notation (base ten). Most programming languages would output this result as -1.0375e+001. The use of a lower case "e" or upper case "E", and the number of leading zeros in the exponent can vary from one programming language to another.<p><u>An important exception:</u> if all bits except the sign bit are zero, then the floating point number is zero, regardless of the sign bit.<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>The input contains an undetermined number of lines.

<P>Bio-informatics is an exciting new field of science, in which computer science techniques are applied to solving biological problems. The search for genetic drugs is one of the central problems of bio-informatics. In tackling this problem, <u>genes from various organisms are compared</u>.<p>A gene is characterized by the sequence of amino acids that can be derived from it. There are altogether 20 amino acids. Each amino acid is identified by a one-letter abbreviation of its full chemical name (the upper case letters of the alphabet, except B, J, O, U, X, and Z, are used to identify amino acids).<p>Your program will look for discrepancies among the amino acid sequences of the given organisms.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>Each logical column of the input specifies a particular gene from a different organism. The number of organisms is at least three but not greater than eight.<p>The first line specifies the names of the organisms. Each name consists of at least one but not more than eight lower case characters and is right-justified in a field of width 9 characters.<p>Each of the remaining lines specifies an amino acid for each of the organisms listed on the first line. Each amino acid is represented by its one-letter abbreviation, right-justified in a field of width 9 characters, under the name of the organism with which it is associated. Thus, in the example shown, the amino acid sequence for the particular yeast gene is M, E, S, L, D, A, N, C, T, M.<p>The amino acid sequences of all organisms represented in a given input file will have the same length (in this example, 10). The minimum length of the amino acid sequences in the input file is 10, the maximum length is 9999.<p>Each amino acid in the amino acid sequence of a particular gene occupies a certain position. The positions are numbered starting at 1 and they increase sequentially. Thus, the yeast sequence in the example shown has M in positions 1 and 10, E in position 2, A in position 6, etc.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>For those positions in which all organisms have the same amino acid (positions 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9 in the example shown), no output will be produced.<p>In those positions in which not all organisms have the same amino acid (positions 3, 4 ,7, 8 and 10 in the example shown) your program will:<blockquote><li>Print the position number. <li>Identify by an asterisk those organisms that deviate (in that particular position) from the most frequently occurring amino acid (in that particular position). <li>In position 3 of the given example, S is certainly the most frequently occurring amino acid, and human is the only organism that does not have S in position 3. <li>In case of a tie for the most frequently occurring amino acid in a particualar position, the amino acid that as the rightmost occurrence (among those involved in the tie) will be chosen as the most frequent one. For example, in position 8 in the given example, both C and A occur twice. We choose C as the most frequent amino acid in position 8, because its rightmost occurrence is under yeast, which is further right than the rightmost occurrence of A (nematode) in this position. In the given example, there is an extreme case of a tie in position 10: all five organisms have different amino acids. Therefore, the amino having the rightmost occurrence, namely R, will be designated as the most frequent one.</blockquote><p>Two lines of the above output are reproduced here with a formatting template:<p><pre>

<P>This program will acquaint you with the judicious method used by rulers of the ancient Roman empire to choose the locations of their military forts.<p>You are given a collection of cities. The cities will be labeled by upper case letters in alphabetical order, starting with 'A'. Given any pair of cities, there is one and only one path between them (see Figure 1).<P><center><IMG SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2082a.gif></center><P>This path may be a direct connection (as between J and C in Figure 1) or it may pass through a number of intermediate cities (as between J and B in Figure 1). In the example of Figure 1, the path from J to B passes through C, G, and F.<P>The actual number of miles between cities is irrelevant. The <u>distance</u> between a pair of cities is defined as the number of hops (each "hop" being taken over a over a direct connection) between them. In Figure 1, the number of hops between J and C is 1, and the number of hops between J and B is 4.<P>Initially, only one of the cities is fortified (by a military fort). As your program executes, additional cities will be fortified. If a city is not fortified, we say it is vulnerable. Furthermore, if a city is vulnerable, its degree of vulnerability is defined as the shortest distance between it and a fortified city. When one or more cities have already been fortified, the location of an additional fort is chosen by a simple rule: it is the most vulnerable city (the one having the highest degree of vulnerability). In case of a tie, choose the alphabetically first city among those tied as the most vulnerable city.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>The first line of the input contains three items of information, separated by one or more blank spaces:<blockquote><li>The total number of cities in the given collection. It will be in the range 3..26. In this example, it is 11, which means that the cities are labeled A..K. <li>An upper case letter in the valid range of cities, denoting the city which is initially fortified. <li>The total number of cities that are to be fortified, including the initially fortified one. It will be at least three and not greater than the total number of cities in the collection</blockquote><P>Each of the remaining lines of the input file will contain two upper case letters, separated by one or more blank spaces. Each letter will be in the range of labels of cities in the given collection. Each pair of letters on one line of input determines a direct connection between two cities. The direct connections listed in the sample input is identical to the direct connections of Figure 1. The set of direct connections listed in the input will satisfy all previously stated conditions.<p>All lines of input will be free of leading or trailing blank spaces.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>The output will list the cities to be fortified, as upper case letters, in the correct order.<p>The upper case letters denoting the cities in the output will be separated by one blank space.

</PRE><P>&nbsp;<p><b>Explanation of the sample output:</b><p>When there is only one fortified city, the degree of vulnerability of each vulnerable city is its distance from the fortified city. Initially, with J being the only fortified city, E is the most vulnerable city with degree of vulnerability 5.<p>With J and E being fortified, D, H, I, and K contend for being the most vulnerable city, all having degree of vulnerability 3. For example, the distance from D to E is 6, the distance from D to J is 3; the smaller of these two numbers is 3. Therefore, the degree of vulnerability of D is 3. The alphabetically first city among the four contenders (D, H, I, and K) is D, which will be the next city to be fortified.<p>Similarly, H, and then K, will be selected as the next city to be fortified. At this point, the number of fortified cities is 5 (as specified in the input), and the program terminates. Note that city I is not fortified, because its degree of vulnerability drops from 3 to 2 once H is fortified, making K the most vulnerable city.<p>

<p>Imagine a perfectly formed honeycomb, spanning the infinite Cartesian plane. It is an interlocking grid composed of congruent equilateral hexagons. One hexagon is located so that its center is at the origin and has two corners on the X-axis. A bee must be very careful about how it travels in order not to get lost in the infinite plane. To get from an arbitrary point A to another arbitrary point B, it will first head from A to the exact center of the hexagon in which A is located. Then, it will travel in a straight line to the exact center of an adjacent hexagon. It will move from center to adjacent center until it has reached the hexagon containing point B. At the destination hexagon, it will move from the center to point B. In all cases, the bee will take a path of minimal distance that obeys the rules. The figure below demonstrates one possible minimal path from point A to point B.</p><p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2084img1.jpg ALT="graphic of a honeycomb"></p><h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a name="INPUT">Input</a> </font></h2><p>Input will be in the form of 5 floating point numbers per line.

<p>XML, eXtensible Markup Language, is poised to become the <i>lingua franca</i> of structured data communication for the foreseeable future, due in part to its strict formatiing requirements. XML parsers must report anything that violates the rules of a <i>well-formed</i> XML document. An XML document is said to be well-formed if it meets all the well-formedness constraints as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) XML specification.</p><p>XML documents are composed of units called elements, that contain either character data and/or other elements. Elements may also contain within their declaration, values called attributes. Consider the following XML document:</p><p><pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;<b>customer</b>&gt;
        &lt;<b>name</b>&gt;

        &lt;/<b>address</b>&gt;
        &lt;<b>orders</b>/&gt;
&lt;/<b>customer</b>&gt;
</pre></p><p>The bold identifiers contained within angle brackets are the elements of the document. The italicized identifer "format" within the "zip-code" element is an attribute of that element. All elements, with the exception of "orders", have a start and an end declaration, also called tags. The "orders" element is an empty element, as indicated by the "/&gt;" sequence that closes the element, and does not require a separate end-tag. The first line is a processing instruction for an XML parser and is <i>not</i> considered an element of the document.</p><p>The rules for a well-formed document are:</p><ol type="1"><li><b>There is exactly one element that is not contained within any other element.</b> This element is identified as the "root" or "document" element. In the example above, "customer" is the document element. <li><b>The structure of an XML document must nest properly.</b> An element's start-tag must be paired with a closing end-tag if it is a non-empty element. <li><b>The name in an element's end-tag must match the element type in the start-tag.</b> For example, an element opened with <tt>&lt;address&gt;</tt> must be closed by <tt>&lt;/address&gt;</tt>. <li><b>No attribute may appear more than once in the same start-tag or empty-element tag.</b> <li><b>A parsed element must not contain a recursive reference to itself.</b> For example, it is improper to include another address element within an address element. <li><b>A named attributed must have an associated value.</b></ol><h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a name="INPUT">Input</a> </font></h2><p>The input will contain a series of XML documents. The start of each document is identified by a line containing only the processing instruction "<tt>&lt;?xml version="1.0"&gt;</tt>". The end of the input is idenitified by a line containing only the text "<tt>&lt;?end?&gt;</tt>" (this is not a true XML processing instruction, just a sentinel used to mark the end of input for this problem). As with all XML documents, white space between elements and attributes should be ignored. You may make the following assumptions with regards to the input.</p><ul><li>The only processing instruction that will be present is the XML version processing instruction, and it will always appear only at the beginning of each document in the input. <li>Element and attribute names are case-sensitive. For example, <tt>&lt;Address&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;address&gt;</tt> are considered to be different.
	<li>Element and attribute names will use only alpha-numeric characters and the dash, "-", character.
	<li>XML comments will not appear in the input.
	<li>Values for attributes will always be properly enclosed in double quotes.
</ul>

<h2>

<p>An entropy encoder is a data encoding method that achieves lossless data compression by encoding a message with "wasted" or "extra" information removed. In other words, entropy encoding removes information that was not necessary in the first place to accurately encode the message. A high degree of entropy implies a message with a great deal of wasted information; English text encoded in ASCII is an example of a message type that has very high entropy. Already compressed messages, such as JPEG graphics or ZIP archives, have very little entropy and do not benefit from further attempts at entropy encoding.</p><p>English text encoded in ASCII has a high degree of entropy because all characters are encoded using the same number of bits, eight. It is a known fact that the letters E, L, N, R, S and T occur at a considerably higher frequency than do most other letters in English text. If a way could be found to encode just these letters with four bits, then the new encoding would be smaller, would contain all the original information, and would have less entropy. ASCII uses a fixed number of bits for a reason, however: it's easy, since one is always dealing with a fixed number of bits to represent each possible glyph or character. How would an encoding scheme that used four bits for the above letters be able to distinguish between the four-bit codes and eight-bit codes? This seemingly difficult problem is solved using what is known as a "prefix-free variable-length" encoding.</p><p>In such an encoding, any number of bits can be used to represent any glyph, and glyphs not present in the message are simply not encoded. However, in order to be able to recover the information, no bit pattern that encodes a glyph is allowed to be the prefix of any other encoding bit pattern. This allows the encoded bitstream to be read bit by bit, and whenever a set of bits is encountered that represents a glyph, that glyph can be decoded. If the prefix-free constraint was not enforced, then such a decoding would be impossible.</p><p>Consider the text "AAAAABCD". Using ASCII, encoding this would require 64 bits. If, instead, we encode "A" with the bit pattern "00", "B" with "01", "C" with "10", and "D" with "11" then we can encode this text in only 16 bits; the resulting bit pattern would be "0000000000011011". This is still a fixed-length encoding, however; we're using two bits per glyph instead of eight. Since the glyph "A" occurs with greater frequency, could we do better by encoding it with fewer bits? In fact we can, but in order to maintain a prefix-free encoding, some of the other bit patterns will become longer than two bits. An optimal encoding is to encode "A" with "0", "B" with "10", "C" with "110", and "D" with "111". (This is clearly not the only optimal encoding, as it is obvious that the encodings for B, C and D could be interchanged freely for any given encoding without increasing the size of the final encoded message.) Using this encoding, the message encodes in only 13 bits to "0000010110111", a compression ratio of 4.9 to 1 (that is, each bit in the final encoded message represents as much information as did 4.9 bits in the original encoding). Read through this bit pattern from left to right and you'll see that the prefix-free encoding makes it simple to decode this into the original text even though the codes have varying bit lengths.</p><p>As a second example, consider the text "THE CAT IN THE HAT". In this text, the letter "T" and the space character both occur with the highest frequency, so they will clearly have the shortest encoding bit patterns in an optimal encoding. The letters "C", "I" and "N" only occur once, however, so they will have the longest codes. There are many possible sets of prefix-free variable-length bit patterns that would yield the optimal encoding, that is, that would allow the text to be encoded in the fewest number of bits. One such optimal encoding is to encode spaces with "00", "A" with "100", "C" with "1110", "E" with "1111", "H" with "110", "I" with "1010", "N" with "1011" and "T" with "01". The optimal encoding therefore requires only 51 bits compared to the 144 that would be necessary to encode the message with 8-bit ASCII encoding, a compression ratio of 2.8 to 1.</p><h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a name="INPUT">Input</a> </font></h2><p>The input file will contain a list of text strings, one per line.

<p>An <i>n-tersection</i> is defined as a location in <i>n</i>-dimensional space, <i>n</i> being a positive integer, having all non-negative integer coordinates. For example, the location (1,2,3) represents an n-tersection in three dimensional space. Two n-tersections are said to be <i>adjacent</i> if they have the same number of dimensions and their coordinates differ by exactly 1 in a single dimension only. For example, (1,2,3) is adjacent to (0,2,3), (2,2,3) and (1,2,4), but not to (2,3,3), (3,2,3) or (1,2). An <i>n-teresting space</i> is defined as a collection of paths between adjacent n-tersections. Finally, an <i>n-credible maze</i> is defined as an n-teresting space combined with two specific n-tersections in that space, one of which is identified as the starting n-tersection and the other as the ending n-tersection.</p><h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a name="INPUT">Input</a> </font></h2><p>The input file will consist of the descriptions of one or more n-credible mazes. The first line of the description will specify <i>n</i>, the dimension of the n-teresting space. (For this problem, <i>n</i> will not exceed 10, and all coordinate vectors will be less than 10.) The next line will contain 2<i>n</i> non-negative integers, the first <i>n</i> of which describe the starting n-tersection, least dimension first, and the next <i>n</i> of which describe the ending n-tersection. Next will be a non-negative number of lines containing 2<i>n</i> non-negative integers each, identifying paths between adjacent n-tersections in the n-teresting space. The list is terminated by a line containing only the value -1. Several such maze descriptions may be present in the file. The end of the input is signalled by space dimension of zero. No further data will follow this terminating zero.</p><h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a name="OUTPUT">Output</a> </font></h2><p>For each maze, output it's position in the input; e.g. the first maze is "Maze #1", the second maze is "Maze #2", etc. If it is possible to travel through the n-credible maze's n-teresting space from the starting n-tersection to the ending n-tersection, also output "can be travelled" on the same line. If such travel is not possible, output "cannot be travelled" instead.</p><h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a name="SAMPLE_INPUT">Sample Input</a> </font></h2><p><pre>

<p>Consider the two networks shown below. Assuming that data moves around these networks only between directly connected nodes on a peer-to-peer basis, a failure of a single node, 3, in the network on the left would prevent some of the still available nodes from communicating with each other. Nodes 1 and 2 could still communicate with each other as could nodes 4 and 5, but communication between any other pairs of nodes would no longer be possible. Node 3 is therefore a Single Point of Failure (SPF) for this network. Strictly, an SPF will be defined as any node that, if unavailable, would prevent at least one pair of available nodes from being able to communicate on what was previously a fully connected network. Note that the network on the right has no such node; there is no SPF in the network. At least two machines must fail before there are any pairs of available nodes which cannot communicate.</p><center><table><tr><td><img border="0" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2090img1.jpg hspace="25"></td><td><img border="0" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/20/p2090img1.jpg hspace="25"></td></tr></table></center><h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a name="INPUT">Input</a> </font></h2><p>The input will contain the description of several networks.

<P>Taekwondo is the name of a traditional Korean martial art and it is turned into a modern international sport. It is adopted by IOC (International Olympic Committee) as an official game of 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. In Taekwondo, there are individual competitions and team competitions. An individual competition is conducted by two players and a team competition is a set of individual competitions. For two groups of players, we are going to make a team competition where two players for each individual competition are selected from each group. Note that players in each group can participate at most one individual competition. For fair competition, weights of two players in each individual competition must be very close.

<P>
Younghee an elementary school student just finished her homework. Today her teacher gave her several lists 
each containing distinct positive integers. The homework was to calculate every sum of each pair of integers 
in a list. The teacher gave students mutually different lists for preventing copying out. So, she had to do the 
homework all by herself. It was hard job because she is not so good at arithmetic and pretty many lists were 
given. After finishing her homework  Younghee went out to play with her friends. When Younghee returned to 
home she found out the lists were lost. Only the papers she wrote the sums were there. Younghee should 
return the lists at the next class because her teacher would check up her homework with the lists. Finally Younghee found out who did it. Her mother thought the lists as garbage and threw them into the garbage can and emptied it. Soon after listening to her mother, Younghee ran to the garbage box in the outside. Alas! The garbage colle ctor already emptied the box. After a little consideration Younghee thinks there might be a way to restore the lists. She calls you and asks you to help her.

<P>
In this problem, you are to solve Younghee's trouble. For each list of sums Younghee wrote, your program should restore the list of distinct integers. But, Younghee is not so good at arithmetic. So, there can be a list of sums which is not restorable, that is, there does not exist a list of integers which leads to the sums. In that case your program s hould print `<TT>-1</TT>'.

The Contortion Brothers are a famous set of circus clowns, known worldwide for their incredible ability
to cram an unlimited number of themselves into even the smallest vehicle. During the off-season, the
brothers like to get together for an Annual Contortionists Meeting at a local park. However, the brothers
are not only tight with regard to cramped quarters, but with money as well, so they try to find the way
to get everyone to the party which minimizes the number of miles put on everyone's cars (thus saving
gas, wear and tear, etc.). To this end they are willing to cram themselves into as few cars as necessary
to minimize the total number of miles put on all their cars together. This often results in many brothers
driving to one brother's house, leaving all but one car there and piling into the remaining one. There is
a constraint at the park, however: the parking lot at the picnic site can only hold a limited number of
cars, so that must be factored into the overall miserly calculation. Also, due to an entrance fee to the
park, once any brother's car arrives at the park it is there to stay; he will not drop off his passengers
and then leave to pick up other brothers. Now for your average circus clan, solving this problem is a
challenge, so it is left to you to write a program to solve their milage minimization problem.

<P>A polygonal number is a number which can be represented by a regular geometrical arrangement of equally spaced points, where the arrangement forms a regular polygon. Some examples are shown in the figure below.<P align="center"><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2100.gif></img><P>The first figure shows the first 4 triangular numbers 1, 3, 6, 10. The next three show the first four square, pentagonal and hexagonal numbers, respectively. In general, k-gonal numbers are those whose points define a regular k-gon (hence triangular numbers are 3-gonal, square numbers are 4-gonal, etc.). We will define k as an index of the polygonal number. For this problem, you are to find numbers which are k-gonal for two or more values of k. We will call these numbers poly-polygonal.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Input will consist of multiple problem instances. Each instance will consist of 3 lines. The first line will be a non-negative integer n &le; 50 indicating the number of types of polygonal numbers of interest in this problem. Note that this line may be longer than 80 characters. The next line will contain n integers indicating the indices of these polygonal numbers (all distinct and in increasing order). For example, if the first line contained the value 3, and the next line contained the values 3 610, then that problem instance would be interested in 3-gonal, 6-gonal and 10-gonal numbers.

A polynomial p(x) of degree n can be used to approximate a function f(x) by setting the coeficients of
p(x) to match the first n coeficients of the power series of f(x) (expanded about x = 0). For example,

Unfortunately, polynomials are "nice" and they do not work well when they are used to approximate
functions that behave poorly (e.g. those with singularities). To overcome this problem, we can instead
approximate functions by rational functions of the form <i>p(x)/q(x)</i>, where <i>p(x)</i> and <i>q(x)</i>
are polynomials. You have been asked by Approximate Calculation Machinery to solve this problem, so they can
incorporate your solution into their approximate calculation software.

Given <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, and the first <i>m + n</i> coeficients of the power series of <i>f(x)</i>, we wish to compute two

<p>The game of checkers is played on an 8 by 8 red-black board using alternate squares. Two players (Red and White) each start with 12 pieces which are set up in the starting position shown below:</p><p ALIGN="center"><img border="0" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2103a.gif width="436" height="260"></p><p>Rules for movement and capture are as follows (Note: a forward move is one in which a piece moves towards the opponent's side of the board):</p><p>1. Players alternate moves.</p><p>2. A piece may move one square forward diagonally to any empty square.</p><p>3. A piece may jump forward over an opposing player's piece if the opposing piece is adjacent to the piece and the square directly beyond the opposing piece is empty. After a jump, the opposing piece is removed from the board (captured). If after a jump, the jumping piece can make another jump, it must do so. This continues until it can make no other jumps. This is called a multiple jump.</p><p>4. A player must make a jump if possible. If several jumps are possible, the player may choose any, even choosing a single jump over a multiple jump. (However, if a multiple jump is chosen, it must be completed.)</p><p>5. The last row on the opponent's side of the board (the row where the piece can make no more forward moves) is the player's promotion row. When a piece reaches the promotion row it is promoted to a king and may now move and capture backward as well as forward. Once a piece is promoted, its move ends-it cannot start to jump or continue a multiple jump after becoming a king until the next turn.</p><p>6. A piece may be jumped at most once during a move (only a consideration when a king is doing the jumping).</p><p>Games are recorded using the square numbering shown above. For example, a simple forward move for White might be 22-18; a single jump for Red might be 14{23 (capturing a White piece at square 18); and a multiple jump for a White king might be 22-31-24-15 (capturing Red pieces at 26, 27 and 19).</p><p>For this problem, you will be given a position of a game in progress and a set of moves to be applied starting at that position, and you must determine if all the moves are legal by writing an Advanced Checkers Machine.</p><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>Input will consist of multiple problem instances.

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Alexander Charles McMillan loves to gamble, and during his last trip to the casino he ran across a new game. It is played on a linear sequence of squares as shown below.</p><p ALIGN="center"><img border="0" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2104a.gif width="364" height="86"></p><p ALIGN="LEFT">A chip is initially placed on the Start square. The player then tries to move the chip to the End square through a series of turns, at which point the game ends. In each turn a coin is flipped: if the coin is heads the chip is moved one square to the right and if the coin is tails the chip is moved two squares to the right (unless the chip is one square away from the End square, in which case it just moves to the End square). At that point, any instruction on the square the coin lands on must be followed. Each instruction is one of the following:</p><p ALIGN="LEFT">1. Move right n squares (where n is some positive integer)</p><p ALIGN="LEFT">2. Move left n squares (where n is some positive integer)</p><p ALIGN="LEFT">3. Lose a turn</p><p ALIGN="LEFT">4. No instruction</p><p ALIGN="LEFT">After following the instruction, the turn ends and a new one begins. Note that the chip only follows the instruction on the square it lands on after the coin ip. If, for example, the chip lands on a square that instructs it to move 3 spaces to the left, the move is made, but the instruction on the resulting square is ignored and the turn ends. Gambling for this game proceeds as follows: given a board layout and an integer T, you must wager whether or not you think the game will end within T turns.</p><p ALIGN="LEFT">After losing his shirt and several other articles of clothing, Alexander has decided he needs professional help-not in beating his gambling addiction, but in writing a program to help decide how to bet in this game.</p><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p ALIGN="LEFT">Input will consist of multiple problem instances.

<p>When rendering a scene with multiple objects onto a screen, the order in 
which the objects are drawn is very important. In general, the farther an object 
is from the screen, the earlier it should be drawn allowing later, closer 
objects to be drawn on top of them. If two objects do not overlap, the order of 
drawing is immaterial. A binary space-partitioning (BSP) tree is one type of 
data structure which attempts to simplify the determination of the ordering of 
objects. It works as follows. Assume that the screen lies in the xy-plane 
centered on the z-axis and that the z-axis points away from the user looking at 
the screen. (For our purposes, assume the user lies near - &#8734;
on the z-axis.) We also assume that all the objects lie on the opposite side of 
the screen (z &gt; 0). The BSP tree is built by placing a series of planes parallel 
to the y-axis. The&nbsp; first plane divides space into two regions: a region 
containing the viewer and a region not containing the viewer. We partition all 
objects in space according to which of these two regions they lie in, and 
observe that all objects in the region containing the viewer should be drawn 
after all the objects in the other region. The BSP tree can be viewed at this 
point as a root with only two children, each child containing one of the 
partitions. We can now add a second plane, which subdivides the space again. We 
split each of the two partitions from the rst plane in two, making a total of 4 
partitions, and the resulting BSP tree now has three levels, with the partitions 
in the leaves (note that some of these partitions may contain several objects 
and some may contain none). This process is continued until each partition has 
at most one object in it, or until some predetermined number of planes has been 
used. The diagram below gives an example of using 1, 2 and 3 planes (looking 
down along the y-axis). For simplicity we assume that all objects lie parallel 
to the z-axis, so we need only deal this 2-d image to determine the BSP tree.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2105a.gif></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Assuming you have split the partitions correctly, a simple 
traversal of the BSP tree will give you an appropriate ordering for which to 
render the objects in the scene. Note in the example above that once a node 
contains just one object it need not be split as additional planes are added.</p>

contain a positive integer n &lt;= 20 indicating the number of objects in the

the xz-plane. All objects will have between 3 and 6 vertices. Objects are

After removing all nonalphabetic characters and converting all letters to upper case, they: 1) replace each letter by the letter s positions after it in the alphabet (1 &le; s &le; 25) - we call this a shift by s- and then, 2) divide the result of step 1 into groups of m letters and reverse the letters in each group (5 &lt;= m &lt;= 20). If the length of the message is not divisible by m, then the last k (less than m) letters are reversed. For example, suppose s = 2 and m = 6.

<P>The <B>ToxicCo</B> chemical company has developed a new, somewhat unstable process for electroplating metals in a hot acid bath. This process requires constant monitoring of the temperatures and voltages present in the bath. Too low a temperature or too high a voltage will cause the dissolved metals to congeal in a mass at the bottom of the vat, damaging the equipment. On the other hand, if the temperature gets too high, acid fumes may be released into the atmosphere. If the voltage goes too low, the chemical reaction is altered, and an explosion becomes possible.<P>A state-of-the-art, artificially-intelligent process controller is supposed not only to keep the vat temperature and voltage at safe levels, but also to continually adjust them so as to maximize the speed of the electroplating process. Unfortunately, the software developers have reported that ``there's still a few bugs in the system" and won't promise delivery of the controller for at least another 9 months. (A few malcontents within the company are beginning to question whether the development team, headed by the nephew of the ToxicCo company president, will ever deliver a working system.)<P>This plant needs to start operation as soon as possible, so you have been commissioned to write a simpler control program to serve in the interim while the delux version is being debugged.<P><P><BR>Write a program to read descriptions of "safe regions" within which temperature and voltage levels can range and to read current temperatures and voltage values and then to determine if the current values are safe.

<P>Bill and Scott are business rivals. Each of them wishes to buy a house in Javaville, but they want to live as far away from each other as possible. Since Javaville is a relatively new town, there are no maps available yet; instead, information about homes and other buildings has been collected by word of mouth and provided to both Bill and Scott. This information consists of building addresses and distances between buildings. All of the information is consistent, although it may be incomplete or redundant.<P>The streets in Javaville are laid out in a rectangular grid of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> east/west streets (named A, B, C, ...) and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> north/south streets (numbered 0, 1, 2, ...), where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> are each between 2 and 10. Every building (either a house or some other building, such as a post office or school) in Javaville is at the intersection of two streets, and no two buildings are located at the same intersection. Some intersections have no buildings at all. All distances are measured in terms of the smallest number of whole blocks that must be traversed north, south, east, and/or west to get from one intersection to another intersection. It is know that there are no more than 50 intersections in the entire town.<P><P><BR>Here is some sample information that might be provided to Bill and Scott by various reliable sources:<P><UL><LI>There are 5 east/west streets and 5 north/south streets.<P></LI><LI>House1 is located at intersection A0<P></LI><LI>The post office is located at intersection A4<P></LI><LI>The school is at a distance of 4 blocks from house1<P></LI><LI>House2 is at a distance of 6 blocks from the post office<P></LI><LI>The school is at a distance of 6 blocks from the post office<P></LI><LI>House3 is at a distance of 6 blocks from the post office </LI></UL><P>From this we can see that there are two possible maps of Javaville-see Figure 1.<P><PRE>

Although the final estimates aren't related to what the additions will cost, Mr. Crooked wants the estimates to be based on a formula so he can explain to the customers how he arrives at the estimate. You've been given the formula and must implement a program to automate his estimates.<P>There is a fixed base cost for adding on an addition; a cost per square foot of finished floor, ceiling, or wall; a cost per square foot of door; and a cost per square foot of window. Additionally, there are maximum widths and heights for standard doors or windows.

<P>Lon Tymago, a professor of history, is having a difficult time training his students not to use the personal pronoun "I" when they write their term papers. Most of Dr. Tymago's students now submit their papers electronically, so the professor has hired you to write a program that will automatically scan the students' papers, identifying occurrences of the pronoun ``I". This will eliminate one step in grading the papers.<P>Unfortunately, history papers often make use of the Roman numeral ``I" (e.g., King George I, Pope John Paul I, World War I). Your program is not to indicate any error when it can be <EM>clearly determined</EM> that one of these situations has occurred.<P><P><BR>The word ``I," used as a pronoun, frequently occurs immediately in front of a verb: ``I think," ``I am," ``I did," and so on. The same can be said of noun phrases such as ``King George I" and ``World War I": ``George I thinks," ``World War I is," and so on. However, some verb forms are appropriate for only one case. It is grammatically correct to write ``I think," but it is not correct to write ``George I think." Likewise, we can say ``I am," but we cannot say ``World War I am." Your program will make use of verb forms as part of its strategy for locating the pronoun ``I." Of course, in some cases the verb form is not enough-for example, ``I had" and ``George I had" are both correct Your program should identify these as indeterminate cases requiring further scrutiny by Dr. Tymago.<P>One other clue helps distinguish valid uses of ``I" from invalid ones: the pronoun ``I" rarely appears immediately before a punctuation mark. (There are exceptions, of course, as in ``I, a student of history, ...," but we will assume that these exceptions will not occur in any of the student papers.)<P><P><BR>You will first be given a list of verb pairs. Each pair will show a form correct for the first-person singular pronoun ``I" and a form correct for a third-person noun (the two forms may be the same). Following this, you will be given several essays written by Dr. Tymago's students. Your program should print each line of text unchanged (including all white space, punctuation, etc.), preceded by a count of the number of positively identified uses of the first-person pronoun ``I" and a count of the uses of ``I" that are possibly incorrect. In addition, these ``I"s should be marked as described below. Correct usages of ``I" (as determined by the verb forms or presence of punctuation) should not be counted or marked.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The data file will begin with a positive integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2110img1.gif ALT="$ \le$">50</SPAN>) indicating the number of verb pairs, followed by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> lines, each containing the first-person and third-person forms of some verb, separated by a space.

<P>
In the wake of the recent controversy
over the intrusive questions asked by the
US Census Bureau during the 2000
census, Congress has decided that
decisive action is required and so, after
much debate, it has decided to ...
commission a fact-finding study.
The Census Bureau has been instructed to
form discussion groups of people from
around the country and of many different
ancestries to help refine the questions for
the 2010 census.

<P>
To encourage diverse responses, no two
members of any discussion group can
come from the same ancestry or from the
same city. Furthermore, because these
people will be together in small meeting
rooms for some time, smokers should not be placed in the same group with non-smokers. Finally, the
caterer has suggested that serving lunch to these groups would be easier if
vegetarians and non-vegetarians were not mixed together.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Write a program to read descriptions of the people participating in the fact-finding study. Your program
should then assign these people to discussion groups so that no two people of the same ancestry are
together in a group, no two people from the same city are together in a group, no group contains a mixture
of smokers and non-smokers, and no group contains a mixture of vegetarians and omnivores (non-
vegetarians).  The program should also enforce limits on the maximum number of discussion groups and
the maximum size of any one group. It is possible that, given such limits, assignment of all people into
groups may not be possible. The program should indicate in its output whether or not a suitable assignment
of people into groups is possible and, if it is possible, the membership of each group.

<P>
All input is taken from the standard input stream. The first line of input will contain two positive integers,
separated by one or more blanks. The first integer is the maximum number of discussion groups permitted.
The second is the maximum number of people per group.

<P>
Each subsequent line of input describes a single person participating in the study. Each person is implicitly
identified by number according to the line in which their description occurs. The first line of input, as
already noted, describes the number and size of groups rather than a person. Therefore the second line of
input describes person #1, the third line describes person #2, etc.

<P>
Each person's description has the form:

<P>
The FAA's most recent plan to replace every
computerized component of their traffic control
system has failed.  They have finally decided to
replace only the most important part, the collision
detection system.  You have been given the
responsibility of writing this life-critical part of the
system.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Your program receives input from an airport's radar
system.  The radar system is very advanced and can
report the position, direction, and speed of any
airplane in the vicinity.  The program must determine
if any plane it sees is likely to collide with any other
plane in the area.

<P>
The airport's radar spins at a continuous rate,
completing one revolution every 4 seconds.  Data is
reported about each plane as the radar faces in that
direction.  As each plane's data is received, the
program must determine if the new plane's course over the next 10 seconds will be too close to the course
of another plane that has been seen by the radar within the past eight seconds.

<P>
The minimum requirement for proximity at this airport is that the planes always be separated by at least
2500 feet in all directions (standard three dimensional distance).  If a test is made between the current plane
and one seen previously, the previous plane's course is plotted by calculating where it would be at the
current time if it has continued its last known direction over the time from when it was last seen to the
present.  For example, for a plane seen 3 seconds previously, that plane's course is plotted by calculating
where it would be 3 seconds after its last observation; then the routes of the two planes over the subsequent
10 seconds is calculated.  If, at any point during those 10 seconds, the planes would be within 2500 feet, the
two planes are too close.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The input to the program consists of the series of radar observations.  Anytime a plane's course will bring it
too close to another plane's course, the program will output a warning listing the two planes.  If a new plane
is too close to multiple planes' flightpaths, the conflicts will be printed out from the most recently seen
plane to the least recently seen.

<P>
The radar spins clockwise.  Note that a plane's course may not conflict with its own course seen previously
by the radar.  More than one plane may be found at a particular bearing of the radar.  Planes with identical
bearings may be listed in any order.  The input will indicate when the plane spins through 0 degrees.
Planes at a bearing of 0 degrees will always be listed after this indication.

<P>
Keep only one entry for each plane.  Keep no entry older than 8 seconds.

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<B>HINT:</B> compass degrees are in a different coordinate system than standard trigonometric degrees.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Because floating point errors may be introduced by different solutions to this problem, the data in all input
files will produce planes which pass either within 2490 feet or further than 2510 feet, so comparisons with
2500 feet are reliable.

Even in ancient times when sea commerce was conducted entirely by sail or rowing, harbors were
sometimes mined to discourage unwelcome visitors (smugglers, raiders, etc.). Of course, in pre-gunpowder
eras, the harbor would be blocked, not with explosives.  Instead, nets, chains, sunken derilict ships and
other debris, lying a little below the waterline, could rip the bottom out of a ship, or at least strand a ship
long enough for shore-bound archers and siege engines to come to bear.

<P>
When ships arrived on legitimate business, a local pilot would row out to meet it, board the ship, and guide
it into port through the safe channels left between the underwater obstacles. The location of these safe
passages was, of course, a closely-held secret that would prove invaluable to a city's enemies.
An agent for an unfriendly power has received a description of the passage through one such harbor and
has been instructed to attempt the passage late at night to verify the accuracy of the information. If the
information is correct, a full-scale invasion will follow.

The agent sets out with two sailors in a small boat with a compass and a pair of sextants (navigational

Write a program that reads in the instructions for the safe path and prints, for each leg of the journey, the

 rose, as shown here. (All angles should be expressed in the range

The Mobius function M(n) is defined on positive integers as follows:
<blockquote>
M(n) = 1 if n is 1.<br>
M(n) = 0 if any prime factor of n is contained in n more than once.<br>
M(n) = (Â–1)<sup>p</sup> if n is the product of p different prime factors.<br>
</blockquote>
For example:
<blockquote>
M(78) = Â–1, since 78 = 2 x 3 x 13.<br>
M(34) = 1, since 34 = 2 x 17.<br>
M(45) = 0, since 45 = 3 x 3 x 5.<br>

A flat rectangular maze is constructed from square cells. Each cell has one, two, or three open sides. The maze has two entry points
from outside the maze, one in the cell at the upper left corner of the maze, and the other in the cell at the lower right corner of the
maze. A maze may have dead ends, but it does not contain any loops. That is, there is no forward path through a maze that will lead
back to a previously visited cell.

<p>
At the same time, two robots (named Ro and Bot) enter and begin traversing the maze. Ro enters at the upper left corner, and Bot
enters at the lower right corner. Each robot takes the same amount of time to move from one cell to the next. The robots follow these
rules in traversing the maze:

<blockquote>
<li>If a robot enters a cell that has only one open side (a dead end), the robot turns around and leaves the cell.
<li>If a robot enters a cell that has two open sides, it leaves using the side through which it did not enter.
<li>If a robot enters a cell that has three open sides A, B and C (labeled in clockwise order), and was first entered through side A, the
robot must choose to leave through side B or side C. Ro will choose to exit through side B, and Bot will choose to exit through
side C. If a dead end later causes a robot to return to the cell, it will then leave through the last remaining open side. For
example, if Ro enters a cell with three open sides through side A, it will leave through side B. If that route leads to dead ends, Ro
eventually returns to the cell and leaves through side C. Naturally if all paths reached through sides B and C lead to dead ends,
the robot eventually retreats back through side A (which it first used when it entered the cell).
<li>The robots stop if they meet in a cell (at the same time) or if they exit the maze.
You are to write a program that will determine from the description of a maze if the robots will stop inside the maze, and if they do,
the cell at which they will stop.
</blockquote>

<p>
A few examples will clarify these ideas. Shown below are three mazes. Below each maze is a table showing the cells through which
the robots will pass while traversing the maze. Row and column numbers are used to identify the cells in each maze.

The input data will contain descriptions of multiple mazes. The description of each maze begins with integers giving the
number of rows (NR) and number of columns (NC) in the maze. Neither NR nor NC will be larger than 20. Following these
integers there will appear NR Ã— NC hexadecimal digits, corresponding to the cells in the maze in row-major order. Blanks
and end of line characters may be included at arbitrary places for readability. Hexadecimal digits include the decimal digits 0
through 9 (representing themselves), and the upper case letters A through F (representing the values 10 through 15
respectively). Each hexadecimal digit identifies the open sides of the corresponding cell in the maze, as follows. Each side
of a cell has an associated number: top = 1, right = 2, bottom = 4, and left = 8. If the numbers corresponding to the open
sides of a cell are totaled, they yield the corresponding hexadecimal digit that will appear in the input for that cell. For
example, a cell that has only its left and right sides open would be specified in the input as the hexadecimal digit A, since 8
(left) + 2 (right) = 10. A cell with its right, bottom, and left sides open would be specified in the input as the hexadecimal
digit E, since the value of E is 14, or 2 (right) + 4 (bottom) + 8 (left).

The single player game of minesweeper is played on a rectangular grid. Each cell in this grid is either vacant or contains a
mine. When the game begins, all cells are covered so the player cannot tell if a cell contains a mine. Plays consist of
selecting and uncovering cells, one at a time. If an uncovered cell contains a mine, the game is over. If the cell does not
contain a mine, it reveals an integer that indicates the number of neighboring cells that do contain mines. Neighboring cells
are those that are immediately adjacent either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

<p>
In this problem, you are given a game grid on which some number of plays has already been made without uncovering a
mine. You are to determine the status of those still covered cells whose status can be determined using only the information
revealed by the uncovered cells. That is, for each cell still covered, determine if its status can be discovered, and if so,
whether or not it contains a mine.

<p>
As an example, consider the grids shown below. The cells with the darker background color and without a number represent
cells that are still covered. The cells containing a number are uncovered, and the number each contains indicates the number
of neighboring cells that contain mines. In the left grid, it is clear that the rightmost uncovered cell in the top row contains a
mine, as do the last uncovered cell in the leftmost column and the rightmost uncovered cell in the second row from the top.
These cells have been marked with an asterisk (*) for clarity. We can now determine that the covered cells marked with a
plus sign (+) have no mines. The status of the cell in the upper left corner of the grid cannot be determined. In the right grid,
we cannot unambiguously determine the status of any uncovered cells. It could be that the first or second cell in the top row
contains a mine, with the other cell not containing a mine.

A popular television game show requires contestants to identify a phrase, usually with some of the letters missing. Some of
these phrases are formed from a combination of two phrases that are unrelated, except that the last word (or words) of the
first phrase are the same as the first word (or words) of the second phrase.

<p>
For example, consider the phrases Â“the shallow end of the poolÂ” and Â“the pool table.Â” The last two words of the first phrase
(Â“the poolÂ”) are the same as the first two words of the second phrase. These phrases could then be combined to yield the
Â“before and afterÂ” phrase Â“the shallow end of the pool table.Â”

<p>
In this problem you are given a set of phrases and asked to find all possible Â“before and afterÂ” phrases that can be produced.
For each such combination, you are to display the two phrases, one per line, with the common words aligned.

A program is needed to assist in checking and visualizing the mazes for problem 3. In that problem, the input consists of a
sequence of maze descriptions. The mazes are rectangular, and consist of a number of square cells. Some of the sides of
these cells are solid, and other sides are open.

<p>
To be consistent, an open side in one cell must correspond to an open side on the adjacent neighboring cell. The maze
characteristics also require that there be only two entry points to the maze, one on the left side of upper left cell in the maze,
and one on the right side of the lower right cell in the maze.

<p>
These maze characteristics can be easily verified if a visual representation of the maze is available. To prepare such a
representation, each cell in the maze is approximately displayed using plus signs at the corners of cells, three hyphens (or
minus signs) for a solid top or bottom side, and a single vertical stroke for a solid left or right side. An appropriate number of
blanks should be used for any open sides of a cell. If a side shared by two cells is inconsistent (solid in one cell and open in
the other), then print three lower-case xÂ’s in place of the three hyphens if a top or bottom side is inconsistent, or a single
upper case X in place of the vertical stroke if a left or right side is inconsistent.

<p>
A cell with solid sides is shown on the left below. To its right a two row, two-column maze is shown. This maze has an
open side to the left of the upper left cell and to the right of the lower right cell. The visualization also shows an
inconsistency between the right side of the upper left cell and the left side of the upper right cell, and an inconsistency
between the lower side of the upper right cell and the upper side of the lower right cell.

of a cell has an associated number: top = 1, right = 2, bottom = 4, and left = 8. If the numbers corresponding to the open

<SPAN ID="txt195"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Modular Division Operation</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
In order to do modular division, you need to understand the modular multiplicative inverse operation. Assume that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I></SPAN> is the multiplicative inverse of a number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN> then the following should hold:
<P><!-- MATH
 \begin{displaymath}
z \cdot b \equiv 1 \ (\mbox{\texttt{Mod }}p)
\end{displaymath}

 ALT="$\displaystyle \equiv$"> 1&nbsp;(<TT>Mod </TT><I>p</I>)

this implies that 
<P><!-- MATH

thus, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>b</I>)<SUP>-1</SUP></SPAN> is the multiplicative inverse of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>. To divide any number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN> by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN> (<TT>Mod </TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>) simply multiply <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN> by the multiplicative inverse of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>

Cribbage is an old card game, usually played by 2 people. Points are scored by having various card 
combinations in a hand.  In Cribbage, many of these combinations are similar to other card games, 
two-of-a-kind, three-of-a-kind, four-of-a-kind and runs (numerically sequential cards of 3 or more).  
But also in Cribbage, combinations of cards that add up to 15 are important. (Face cards are 
counted as 10 points, and aces are worth 1 point).

<P>
In a standard, two-player game, each person is dealt 6 cards. Four of these cards are kept as the 
player's hand, and the other 2 are placed in the ``crib". The crib is given to each player 
alternately. 
Therefore, scoring is done on groups of 4 cards (either in the hand or the crib). In addition, a 
single card is turned up (after the crib is made), which can be used to supplement the scoring. 

<P>
In our version of Cribbage, we will be ``dealt" 8 cards, plus the one extra. It is the job of your 
program to divide the 8 dealt cards into a hand and a crib (4 cards each) such that the maximum total 
score is achieved, using the extra card as appropriate. (That is, the sum of the hand and the crib is 
maximized.) 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
For our purposes, we will not use card suits, and we will represent the cards as single characters, 
as follows:

<P>
Ace=1, Two=2, Three=3, Four=4, Five=5, Six=6, Seven=7, Eight=8, Nine=9, Ten=T, Jack=J, 
Queen=Q, King=K

Your task is to write a program that reads a file of ``dealt" cards, and returns the maximum point

<P>This problem features a variant of the game of "poker solitaire" (PS). To play PS, deal a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">5 <TT>x</TT> 5</SPAN> grid of cards from a standard deck. The score for a PS grid is the SUM of the scores for each row, column, and diagonal. These twelve hands each score as follows:<P><UL><LI>pair (1 point) two of the five cards have the same rank. </LI><LI>two pair (3 points) two pairs amongst the five cards. </LI><LI>three of a kind (5 points) three of the five cards have the same rank. </LI><LI>straight (7 points) the five cards may be arranged in sequence, 8-6-9-7-5. Aces may be high (above King) or low (below 2). </LI><LI>flush (10 points) All five cards are the same suit. </LI><LI>full house (12 points) one pair and three of a kind. </LI><LI>four of a kind (25 points) four of the five cards have the same rank. </LI><LI>straight-flush (50 points) both a straight and a flush. </LI></UL><P>In normal poker solitaire, the player deals one card at a time and can place the card in any open space until all twenty-five are dealt. But we've changed the game! We'll give you a grid of twenty-five cards and then you'll swap pairs of cards to try to maximize the score. At each step, choose the pair of cards that maximizes the score (be greedy).<P>You'll need to calculate the number of steps until no single step yields improvement.<P>If there are several possible steps with the same score, break ties by choosing the pair with the lowest POSITIONED card in it, using the following grid:<P><PRE>

 21 22 23 24 25
</PRE><P>For example, swapping 1 &amp; 24 would take priority over swapping 2 &amp; 3.

<P>Congratulations!

They would like to have their signal strength exceed a constant at every integer coordinate in the zone. The signal strength at a point is just the sum of the signals from all transmitters. This total signal must exceed 100.<P>The signal at location <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> from a transmitter <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> of power <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> is given by:<P><P></P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay"><I>floor</I>(<I>P</I>/<I>D</I>(<I>L</I>, <I>T</I>)<SUP>2</SUP>)</DIV><P></P><P>That is, signal degrades quadratically in this world.<P>Sometimes the signal at all points is above the threshold, but usually it isn't.

Your job is to determine the integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN>,<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> location and integer power <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> such that the signal at all locations within the region exceeds 100.<P>Note that it is possible to place more than one transmitter at a single location.

<P>A very colorful one-person game can be played as follows. First a set of colors is selected then a set of circles is drawn using some or all of the colors, with duplicates possible-there are at least as many circles as colors. These circles are then connected together in any way by colored arrows-any number of arrows, with any colors, may be used to connect any pair of circles. For example, if we use the four colors R, G, B, and Z and four circles then we could have the following situation:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="270" HEIGHT="233" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2129img1.png ALT="\epsfbox{p2129.eps}"></DIV><P>Three different circles are then picked from the set; two of them have a counter placed inside, while the third is the ``target" circle. A counter may be moved from one circle to another along an arrow (in the correct direction), only if the other counter is not in the circle being moved to, and the color of the arrow is the same as the color of the circle the other counter is in.

Your competitors in the low end routing business are adding firewall type features and your sales 
department is frantic. They want to add access lists ASAP. 

<P>
But the marketeers also require that `wire speed' routing not be compromised and the routing engine 
is underpowered. Your job is to write a simulator to help answer the performance questions. 

<P>
Engineering has used a sniffer to record network traffic and extracted the relevant information from 
the packet headers. 

<P>
Here are some samples of the simulated traffic packets:

A dotted decimal address is a 32 bit value, high order byte first, with the decimal representation of 
each 8-bit byte (0..255) separated by a `.' (decimal point). For example, 1.2.255.15 is 0x0102FF0F.

A range is two decimal numbers separated by `-' with no whitespace between the numbers and the `-'. For example, 5-52 will match any port number between 5 and 52. 

<P>
In the access list, the protocol and the ports can be specified as `*', which means match any 
protocol or port.

<P>
A dotted decimal mask is the same format as an address. It indicates which bits are significant 
when comparing addresses. For example, the addresses 123.234.248.14 and 123.234.254.126 
match when compared with the mask 255.255.240.15 (0xFFFFF00F). The 1 bits in the mask show 
which bits in the addresses to compare. Note that a mask of 0.0.0.0 will cause any address pair to 
match. 

<P>
The way an access list works is each simulated traffic packet is compared with the access list 
entries, in the same order those entries were provided, until the packet matches an entry. For a 
match to occur, the protocol, source and destination addresses (using the respective masks), and 
ports must all match. In a real router, the action directs the router to accept or reject the packet, 
but the simulator just keeps track of how many access list entries are compared, and the number of 
times each action is taken. 

<P>
For example, if a packet matches the 3rd, 5th, and 8th entries in a 30 entry access list, (with the 
action of the 3rd entry being `permit'), then processing that packet will contribute 3 comparisons 
and add 1 to the number of `permit' actions taken. In this case the 5th and 8th entries are not 
examined further. The first entry that matches is the last examined for a given packet.

<P>
The input file will be a series of test cases. Each test case consists of two groups of data, 
separated by a blank line. A blank line also separates test cases. The first group of data in a test 
case is the access list entries, one per line. There will be no more than 100 access list entries. The 
next group of data in the test case is the simulated packet traffic data. Each of these lines will be at 
most 100 characters. The test case is terminated by a blank line or end-of-file.

For each test case print 3 numbers: the total count of access list entries compared; the number of 
simulated packets resulting in the `permit' action; and the number of simulated packets resulting in 
the `deny' action. Put no leading spaces before the first number and exactly 1 space before the 2nd 
and 3rd numbers.

<P>
You have recently landed a job with an supercomputing application hosting firm. The
firm's primary mission is to provide distributed computing for its customers across its
networked supercomputer. The supercomputer consists of many individual computers
of varying size (i.e. Mainframes, Servers, and Workstations) and configurations (i.e.
OS's, hardware, MIPS). Each of these computers are commonly referred to as
processing nodes. Customers submit to a centralized distribution point the programs
they want executed and the sets of data files to be processed. Each program is
distributed to the processing nodes along with a particular data file. The program is
then executed on each node with general security privileges. The types of programs
that customers submit are thread intensive, utilize a large amount of inter-process
communication, and execute generic OS system calls. The results of the processing
are then communicated to the submitter.

<P>
The firm's customers are primarily competing bioengineering firms researching the
human genome. Each is racing to patent particular genes and gene interactions which
they discover. Since the applications are submitted directly by the customers and
many customers will be submitting programs for distributed computation at the same
time, security of the processing nodes and of individual customer data and source
code is of paramount importance.

<P>
Your project lead is concerned that some customers may try to interject virus or
malicious code into the distribution process, either to crash the processing nodes, steal
the source code and data of other customers, or affect the programs of other customers
in order to produce erroneous data.

<P>
You have been tasked with writing a malicious code scanning program for the
distribution subsystem. Its primary functional requirement is to scan programs and
data files submitted by customers and compare them to the malicious code library
your company maintains. This program will produce reports indicating if malicious
code exists in the submitted program and data files.

<P>
Here are a the requirements given to you by your lead:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Malicious code characters always appear in files sequentially without interruption i.e. "the dog" will always appear as "the dog" never as "the cat dog".
</LI>
<LI>A malicious code character may differ from the signature character, however they will only differ in the character ASCII value not in the amount of characters i.e. "the dog" may be represented as "The dog" or " he dog" or "tHe doc" but not as "the ddog". <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">SPECIAL CASE: at no time will an EOLN (end of line)/ carriage return character replace an ASCII value of a malicious code character</SPAN>.
</LI>
<LI>Malicious code match percentages are determined with the following formula:
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<P><!-- MATH
 \begin{displaymath}
\mbox{Code match percentage} = {{\# \mbox{of characters matching the virus signature}} \over
{\# \mbox{of characters in the virus signature}}}.
\end{displaymath}

</DIV><P></P>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Code, or data files, are considered CLEAN or POISON.
</LI>
<LI>"CLEAN" indicates the file does not contain any malicious code matches equaling or exceeding the threshold percentage for any signature. ``POISON" indicates that the file does contain malicious code matches exceeding the threshold percentage for at least one signature.
</LI>
<LI>If more than one instance of malicious code exists, examine them all. If any one exceeds the threshold the code is considered POISON.

A LSU physics researcher who we will call ``Sparky" was very successful in procuring
funding for the physics department because of his breakthrough research into new
3-dimensional crystalline storage technology. Though a brilliant physicist, Sparky's
organizational habits were lacking. His office was strewn with stacks of crystal pictures,
and most were not labeled in any way other than to note the orientation of the crystal.

<P>
Unfortunately for the physics department, Sparky asphyxiated from laughter after a
night grading midterms for his Physics For Non-Majors class. You are the lucky new
non-tenured professor that has been hired by the Physics departement to decipher
Sparky's research and keep that grant money flowing.

<P>
In Sparky's now vacant office, there is a mess of picutures all about. You know that he
was taking three pictures of each crystal he grew (one picture down each primary axis:
X,Y,Z). You also know that the crystals grew in a liquid suspension and therefore don't
necessarily consist of a single continuous mass.

<P>
As a first step in organizing the mess you decide to take the pictures three at a time (one
down each axis) and see whether or not they could be pictures of the same crystal. Of
course, you know Sparky always took pictures of cubical areas, so you pick out pictures
of the same dimensions before examining them.

<P>
Here are some other useful things that you know about the pictures:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>All the pictures are black-and-white.
</LI>
<LI>Every picture is of resolution <!-- MATH
 $N \times N$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>N</I></SPAN> (in other words, each picture is a square).
</LI>
<LI>Each picture was created by placing the crystal on top of the film and shining a light through the crystal. The result was that areas of the film hit directly by the light (without passing through the crystal) are bright. Any light striking the crystal is reflected away from the film. The resulting picture is therefore a silohuette of the crystal projected down a particular axis.
</LI>
<LI>The crystal grows in a very regular way. It creates small cubical areas precisely <!-- MATH
 $1\times1\times1$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1 <TT>x</TT> 1 <TT>x</TT> 1</SPAN> that may be adjacent to one another or that may grow separately. In essence, the crystal is a <!-- MATH
 $N\times N\times N$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>N</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>N</I></SPAN> matrix where at any coordinate in the matrix a piece of crystal may or may not reside.
</LI>
</UL>

After numerous recounts of the presidential votes in Florida, candidates George W. Bush (Republican) and Al Gore (Democrat) are unconvinced of the accuracy of the results. Each candidate is convinced that he should receive Florida's electoral votes needed to win the presidency and no amount of recounting the ballots will determine a clear winner. Also, it was revealed that some of the volunteers forgot to turn in several ballot boxes, and are currently unavailable on vacation at Disney World. 

<P>
The U.S. population is justly demanding a resolution to the problem to avoid a third term under Clinton. Political analysts insist that they can determine which candidate the state will be awarded to, based on the income levels of its districts' residents. Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida, has asked you to write a program that will determine which candidate will win Florida, and ultimately the election. The future of the country rests in your hands.

<P>
The program will be based on the electoral college system, extended to the district level. Each district is worth a certain number of electoral votes, with the winner of the district determined by the median income of its residents. Exit polls have revealed that if the median income of the district is greater than a certain level, it will be awarded to
the Republican candidate. A simple majority of electoral votes is needed to win the entire state (a tie will result in the deciding vote being cast by Jeb, resulting in a Republican victory).

</LI>
<LI>The fourth line will contain the number of districts.
</LI>
<LI>The fifth line will contain the target median income level. A district with a median income greater than the target will have its electoral votes go to the Republican candidate. All other electoral votes will go to the Democratic candidate.
</LI>
<LI>Each of the next lines will contain a district's name, its median income level (formatted as a simple integer), and its number of electoral votes (also an integer), each separated by a comma.

To get a really good price, he decided to have the free operating system, "JameSIX", installed instead of the more popular and expensive "Windwoes" operating system. One drawback to the free OS is that there are many bugs, but James is a savvy computer programmer and thinks it worth the risk.<P>A few days later, James is attempting to play "Sweeper" when all of a sudden the screen flashes and some strange output appears. Angered by this interruption to his favorite game, James decides to use his vast programming knowledge and attempt to debug the program in the free debugger, JDB.<P>James has found a suspicious piece of code. He knows the values of all variables, and he is attempting to determine if the code fragment was the one that produced the output that interrupted his high-score attempt.<P>The "JameSIX" Assembly language in which the program was written has a very simple set of commands:<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=2 BORDER FRAME=BOX RULES=GROUPS><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=JUSTIFY WIDTH="1.5"><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=JUSTIFY WIDTH="4.5"><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP COLSPAN=1><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Command</SPAN></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP COLSPAN=1><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Explanation</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="108"><TT>START</TT> <!-- MATH

Once upon a time there lived a programmer with the potential to be the best Java programmer the world had ever seen, and his name was Sebastian. Unfortunately for Sebastian, he was born several decades prematurely and was forced to store all of his programs on punchcards. If you do not know what a punchcard is ask one of your professors after the contest. We are sure she will be able to tell you many horror stories about punchcards and shoe boxes.

<P>
One day Sebastian had to turn in his senior project, a program that calculated pi to a billion decimal places. On his way to deliver his program to the grader, he was suddenly overtaken by a vicious case of scurvy (pizza just doesn't have that much vitamin C). In his mad dash to the nearest lavatory, he dropped the box of punchcards containing his program, and the cards scattered everywhere.

<P>
After he had picked up all the cards, and counted them, he realized that one was missing. Luckily Sebastian had taken the time to record his program card-by-card in a notebook at the dorm. This will allow him to replicate the missing card and still turn his project in on time. The problem was that the cards were all jumbled and he didn't
know which card to replicate.

<P>
Here are a few things that Sebastian knows about his cards:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Sebastian's program had at least 1 card before he dropped it.
</LI>
<LI>There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> cards numbered from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>.
</LI>
<LI>Exactly one card is missing.
</LI>
<LI>No cards have duplicate numbers.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Please write a program to help Sebastian determine what card number his needs to replicate so that he can turn-in his project on time.

My Uncle Lester is known throughout Lafayette Parish as the luckiest man around. He has picked the winners of the last 7 NCAA Basketball Championships. During Mardi Gras last year, I got Uncle Lester to explain exactly how he is able to consistently pick the winners of this event. He is convinced that if you rate teams' offense and defense
on a scale of 1 to 10 and then multiply their offensive rating by 5 and subtract double their opponents defensive rating, you will have calculated that teams score if that team played their opponent. (Keep in mind that if a score is not an integer, then that score will be rounded to the nearest whole number.) I told Uncle Lester that this could result
in negative scores and he told me that was true, but the eventual outcome is accurate.
Whoever has the greatest score will win the game and continue on to the next round.

If one team beats the other team by more than 10 points, the winning team's offensive rating will increase by .5. A tie score will result in the winner being the team with the mascot name which would appear first in alphabetical order between the two teams.

<P>
As you may know, the NCAA seeds all teams in the tournament. They seed the teams according to their offensive rating. The higher the offensive rating is, the lower the seed is. If more than 1 team has the same offensive rating, then the school mascot names are sorted in alphabetical order with the first team in the list getting the next lowest seed number available. For example, if in determining seed 3, a team with mascot name Bananas has the same offensive rating as a team with mascot name Mangoes then Bananas would be awarded seed 3 position. The tournament bracket is laid out where the highest seeded team plays the lowest seeded team, the second highest seeded team plays the second lowest seeded team, and so on. The winner of the first two games play each other and so on.

<P>The Dominion War has ended and Benjamin Sisco has convinced the Wormhole Aliens to allow the Federation unlimited access to the wormhole that connects Alpha Quadrent and Delta Quadrent. In his discussions with the aliens, Sisco learned that there are other Wormholes that exist throughout the galaxy.

<P>Swamp County Electronics is a leading supplier of military-grade widgets, and has been using Statistical Process Control for years to help monitor and control its widget manufacturing process. Statisical Process Control, or SPC, is a discipline that uses sampled and measured products, statistics, and historical sample data to determine if a manufacturing process is either in control or out of control.<P>Swamp County Electronics (SCE) uses <SPAN CLASS="textit">control charts</SPAN> to detect when its product (hence its process) goes out of control: at the end of each hour of production, five units are removed from the assembly line for measurement. Statistics calls the taking of one or more measurements for a single statistical analysis a <SPAN CLASS="textit">sample</SPAN>, usually denoted <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN>. Testing the widgets is very complicated; only two units can be tested per hour. The testing apparatus is outrageously expensive and SCE can afford only one such apparatus. As such, at the end of the eight hour workday, the Quality Assurance Team works into the wee hours of the morning, measuring all the units in each sample. As soon as each sample is measured, the sample mean, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2139img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{X}}$"></SPAN>, and the sample range, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN>, are calculated:<P><P></P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay"><IMG WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="39" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2139img1.png ALT="$\displaystyle \overline{{X}}$"> = <IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="55" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2139img1.png ALT="$\displaystyle {\frac{{1}}{{5}}}$"><IMG WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="69" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2139img1.png ALT="$\displaystyle \sum_{{i=1}}^{{5}}$"><I>x</I><SUB>i</SUB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>R</I> = max(<I>X</I>) - min(<I>X</I>)</DIV><P></P>where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> represents each individual measurement. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2139img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{X}}$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN> are then plotted consecutively on an X&amp;R control chart as in Figure 1.

The problem is that the irregular patterns can take up to ten hours to detect, and may not be detected until two days after the onset of the problem.<P>Before investing in two more test apparatuses to detect irregularities in ``real time," SCE wishes to investigate the use of <SPAN CLASS="textit">precontrol charts</SPAN>. Precontrol charts require only two measurements per sample, and these measurements are plotted with respect to the specified product tolerances (upper and lower limits) and precontrol, or PC, lines. PC lines are set at <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="39" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2139img1.png ALT="$ {\frac{{1}}{{4}}}$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="39" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2139img1.png ALT="$ {\frac{{3}}{{4}}}$"></SPAN> of the total specified tolerance range. See Figure 3. The precontrol chart is divided into red, yellow, and green zones, with the red zone outside the tolerance limits, yellow between the PC line and the nearest tolerance limit, and green between the PC lines. Green is defined by the closed interval [0:25; 0:75] of the tolerance range, yellow by the half-opened intervals [0; 0:25) and (0:75; 1] of the tolerance range. If either measurement falls in a red zone, or both measurements fall into yellow zones, the process is probably out of control. Compared to X&amp;R charts, the precontrol charts have a higher probability of signaling a problem incorrectly (a false positive), or failing to detect a problem even if it exists (false negative).<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="855" HEIGHT="436" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2139img1.png ALT="\epsfbox{p2139b.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 2.

You will use the historical sample data from the control charts. From this data you will compute sample means and ranges for control chart analysis. Then, using only the first two measurements of each sample, you will apply the precontrol chart criteria (red, yellow, green zones), indicating when a false positive or false negative occurs with respect to the out-of-control patterns depicted in Figures 2a through 2e. Bear in mind that the control chart method is a series-based indicator-when an irregularity is detected at the end of a sequence, the irregularity actually started at the beginning of the sequence. The precontrol chart indicates ``instantaneous" behavior. <SPAN CLASS="textit">A precontrol false positive occurs when there are no irregular control chart sequences overlaying its sample, and occurs at the instantaneous sample</SPAN>. A precontrol false negative really doesn't exist at a particular sample; rather it is the lack of any precontrol problem indication over the duration of a control chart out-of-control sequence. <SPAN CLASS="textit">A false negative is reported at the end of a control chart irregular sequence</SPAN>.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Input to your program consists of two lines of quality specifications: the first line contains the process mean, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="22" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2139img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{\overline{X}}}$"></SPAN>, and upper and lower control limits.

<P>Satellite imagery that was collected worldwide is being reformatted into a latitude/longitude coordinate system in order to produce a map. The data is being divided into square cells for layout onto a grid. The map grid extends completely around the world in the longitudinal (west-east) direction but does not extend to either the North or the South Poles in the latitudinal (north-south) direction. Within the area covered by the grid, there are cells for which no data was collected. These cells are to be left blank on the map.<P>All cells are of equal size and are oriented so that their corners coincide with the intersections of the gridlines. Figure 1 shows a sample map grid with 8 cells in the longitudinal direction and 3 cells in the latitudinal direction. The map wraps around at the left and right edges. The areas containing data are represented by shaded cells. In the following discussion, the shaded cells are referred to as map cells.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="695" HEIGHT="219" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2140.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p2140.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1.

Your competitors in the low end routing business are adding firewall type features and your sales department is frantic. Sales wants to add access lists ASAP. The marketeers also require that `wire speed' routing not be compromised, but the routing engine is underpowered. Your job is to write a simulator to help answer the performance questions.

<P>
Engineering has used a sniffer to record network traAEc and to extract the relevant information from the packet headers, generating a stream of simulated traAEc. Here are some samples of the simulated traffic packets:

The fields are separated by one or more blanks and the first field may be preceded by one or more blanks. A dotted decimal address is a 32-bit value, high order byte first, with the decimal representation of each 8-bit byte [0..255] separated by a `<TT>.</TT>'. For example, 1.2.255.15 is 0x0102FF0F. Ports are in the range [0..65535]. Note that ports are significant for the TCP (6) and UDP (17) protocols only. The port fields will be 0 for other protocols. The protocol is in the range [0..255].

A range is two decimal numbers separated by `<TT>-</TT>' with no whitespace between the numbers and the `<TT>-</TT>'. For example, 5<TT>-</TT>52 will match <!-- MATH
 $5 \le port \ number \le 52$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">5<IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2141img1.png
 ALT="$ \le$"><I>port</I>&nbsp;<I>number</I><IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2141img1.png
 ALT="$ \le$">52</SPAN>. In the access list, the protocol and the ports can be specified as `<TT>*</TT>', which means match any protocol or port.

<P>
A dotted decimal mask is the same format as an address. It indicates which bits are significant when comparing addresses. For example, the addresses 123.234.248.14 and 123.234.254.126 match when compared using the mask 255.255.240.15 (0xFFFFF00F). The 1 bits in the mask show which bits in the addresses to compare. Note that a mask of 0.0.0.0 will cause any address pair to match.

<P>
Each simulated traffic packet is compared with the access list entries, in the same order those entries were entered, until the packet matches an entry. For a match to occur, the protocol, source and destination addresses (using the respective masks), and ports must <SPAN  CLASS="textit">all</SPAN> match. In the real router, the action directs the router to accept or reject the packet, but the simulator just keeps track of how many access list entries are compared, and the number of times each action is taken. For example, if a packet matches the 3rd, 5th, and 8th entries in a 30-entry access list, with the action of the 3rd entry being `permit', then processing that packet will contribute 3 comparisons and add 1 to the number of `permit' actions taken. If the action were `deny', 3 would also be added to the comparison count, but 1 would be added to the `deny' count. In either case the 5th and 8th entries are not examined. The first entry that matches is the last examined for a given packet.

<P>The human rights organization, PeopleFirst, has observers around the world checking up on human rights abuses in various countries. Since some countries take a dim view of this sort of activity, PeopleFirst needs a way for their observers to report abuses without the countries they are residing in realizing that a report is being made. The idea is this: Their observers will create websites where they will display photographs of their sightseeing trips, collections, or other hobbies, but the pictures will be subtly altered to hide the reports in them.<P>There is software available to do this, but PeopleFirst doesn't want to run the risk that some government will try one of these programs on their observer's pictures and find a hidden message. To avoid that, one of their members has written a custom program for hiding messages in pictures. Unfortunately, she had to leave on her own stint as an observer before she could write the program that extracts the messages from the pictures. That's where you come in. You've been asked to write the missing program.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The observer's photographs are posted to their web sites in GIF format. Prior to being given to your program, the pictures are run through a filter that converts them to ppm format, so your program has a simpler picture representation to work with. The ppm format begins with the two characters ``P6" followed by whitespace, most often a single linefeed character. This is followed by the picture width and height formatted as two decimal numbers in ASCII, separated by whitespace. The height is followed by more whitespace, again most often a single linefeed. Following this is the maximum color component value: a decimal number in ASCII. This is the value of the brightest shade for any of the three primary colors in a pixel. You should ignore this value and treat it as if it were 255. This is immediately followed by a single whitespace character, usually a linefeed. Immediately after the whitespace character are <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3 <TT>x</TT> <I>width</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>height</I></SPAN> bytes representing a left to right, top to bottom scan of the pixels in the picture, three bytes per pixel, representing the shades of red, green and blue for the pixel, in that order. Treat each byte as an unsigned binary number representing the shade.<P>The message is hidden in the picture by altering the original pixel values slightly. Each pixel in the picture encodes one bit of the message, which is extracted by taking the exclusive-or of the low order bits of the shades of red, green and blue that make up the pixel. Message bits are assigned to pixels from left to right in rows, starting with the top left pixel in the picture, and ending with the bottom right pixel. The first thing encoded in the picture is the length of the message. It is encoded as 32 bits of binary, starting with the low order bit. The length is immediately followed by the bytes of the message, each byte encoded with the low order bit first. The message is immediately followed by a 32-bit checksum, with the low order bit appearing first.<P>The checksum is calculated from all of the bytes of the message length and the message. In calculating the checksum, the bytes of the message length are ordered with the low order byte first. Initialize the checksum to hexadecimal <TT>ffffffff</TT>. For each byte that goes into the checksum, first do a single bit left circular shift of the 32 bits of the checksum, then add the byte as an unsigned value, ignoring any overflow.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Output consists of the extracted message, or an error message if no hidden message was found in the input picture. A bad message length or invalid checksum indicate that the input picture has no hidden message.<P>If the extracted message length is zero, output the following error message and exit before producing any other output:<P><P><BR><TT>No message found: message length is zero</TT><P><P><BR>If the extracted message length has a value so large that there wouldn't be enough pixels in the input picture to encode all of the bits of the message length, message and checksum, output the following error message and exit before producing any other output:<P><P><BR><TT>No message found: bad length: <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>msz</I></SPAN> bits <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>psz</I></SPAN> pixels</TT><P><P><BR>In the actual message, replace <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>msz</I></SPAN> with the number of bits needed to encode the message length, message and checksum; replace <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>psz</I></SPAN> with the number of pixels in the picture. Output both numbers in decimal.<P>If the checksum you calculate does not equal the extracted checksum, output the following error message and exit before producing any other output:<P><P><BR><TT>No message found: bad checksum: recorded = <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>rcs</I></SPAN>, calculated = <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ccs</I></SPAN></TT><P><P><BR>In the actual message, replace <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>rcs</I></SPAN> with the extracted checksum, and replace <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ccs</I></SPAN> with the calculated checksum. Output both checksums with the prefix `<TT>0x</TT>', followed by 8 hexadecimal digits, using lower case for the alphabetic hexadecimal digits. The string `<TT>0x13579bdf</TT>' would be one example of the required format.<P>The judge's data will have no improperly formatted input or require impossibly large memory allocations. Consequently, the three defined errors will be the only ones that can appear legally in your output.<P>Note that the ppm formatted picture is likely to contain many unprintable characters, and there is no requirement that the message consists solely of printable characters either. The sample input printed on this page has `<code> </code>' to indicate spaces and the expression `<code>&lt;ffl&gt;</code>'
that represent 0x0a (linefeed). Each line is broken after the occurrence of 0x0a for readability. To view your input and output, the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">od</SPAN> command should prove useful. To view the pictures as pictures, you can use <SPAN  CLASS="textit">xloadimage</SPAN>. A more interesting example is available via the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">getdata</SPAN> command: the picture, jellies.ppm, hides another picture, the GIF file, redrose.gif.

It is followed by the descriptions of the questions themselves, each in its own subsection. Questions are numbered, starting with 1, in the order that they appear in this section.<P>The first line of the subsection for a ballot question contains its name. The second line contains two numbers, the first of which is the number of choices for this question. The second number is the number of choices that can be voted for on the question, since some questions, like positions on a party's central committee, allow you to vote for more than one candidate. The remaining lines are the names of the choices, one per line. The choices are numbered from 1, in the order they appear in the question.<P>The second section is a description of the ballots, which has a separate subsection for each precinct, since which questions are voted on and the order of the choices may vary by precinct. The first line in this section contains the number of precincts in the county. It is followed by the subsections describing the ballots in each precinct.<P>The first line of a precinct ballot description subsection contains two numbers: the precinct number, and the number of ballot positions in use on ballots in that precinct. The following lines associate one of those ballot positions with the vote it represents. Each line contains a ballot position number and the question and choice numbers associated with that ballot position. Thus a line containing `<TT>31 2 5</TT>' indicates that a vote in position 31 on that precinct's ballot is a vote for choice 5 of question 2, as given in the description of the ballot questions in the first section of input.<P>The last section is the raw ballot information, one line per ballot, until end-of-file. A ballot line starts with the precinct number for the ballot, right justified in a 4-character field. This field is followed (after a single blank) by 48 pairs of hexadecimal digits encoding the 384-bit bit string that represents how the ballot was voted. In this representation, the bits in the bit string are numbered from 1 to 384, and each position on the ballot is represented by the identically numbered bit. That bit is 1 if the corresponding ballot position is marked, and 0 if it is not marked. In the string of 96 hexadecimal digits that encodes this bit string, bit number 1 is the high order bit of the first hex digit, and the numbering proceeds from high order to low order bit in each hexadecimal digit, until bit number 384, which is the low order bit of the last hex digit. Count the ballots, starting at 1 as you read them, in case you need to report an error on that ballot.<P>Numbers are represented by strings of decimal digits in ASCII. Bit strings are represented by strings of pairs of hexadecimal digits, as already described. Multiple numbers and bit strings can appear on the same line, separated by single blanks. Character strings are represented by a single line of printable characters, including blanks, but excluding the newline character that terminates the line.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Ballots must be checked for validity before they can be counted. If the precinct number on a ballot is not known (did not appear in the ballot description section of the input), print the ballot number and the string ``bad precinct" as an error message. If a ballot has any marks in positions that do not correspond to any ballot choices for ballots in that precinct, print the ballot number and the string ``stray mark" as an error message. Either of these two errors will void the entire ballot. Do not count any votes from such a ballot.<P>If a ballot has votes for more than the allowed number of choices on a question, only the vote on that question is voided. This error does not void the entire ballot. If this happens, print the ballot number, the question number, and the string, ``too many votes" as an error message. Do not count the vote for any choice on that question (or any other voided question) on the ballot, but do count the votes for any questions that have not been voided on that ballot.<P>Each error message should be on a single line and should contain just the numbers and strings mentioned. There should be just a single blank character between each number and string. Do your validity checks for each ballot in the order given. If the precinct is bad, don't bother checking anything else. If there are stray marks, don't bother reporting that some questions may have too many votes. For any ballot, report too many votes on more than one question in the order of their question numbers. If there are any error messages, follow them by three empty lines to separate them from the result output.<P>The first line of result output should start with 32 blanks, followed by the string ``Election Results", providing a title for the election results. The title line is followed by an empty line and then the results for each question in the order they were presented in the first section of the input.<P>The result for each question is output as a line containing 8 blanks and the name of the question, followed by an empty line, followed by one line for each choice in that question, in the order they appeared in the first section of the input. The line for each choice begins with the choice name, left justified in a field of 64 characters, followed by a single space followed by the number of votes for that choice, right justified in a field of 10 characters, followed by a single space, followed by the percentage of the vote for that choice on that question, rounded to the nearest integer, right justified in a field of 3 characters, and followed by a percent sign. Note that the percentage is the percentage of ballots cast on that question that voted for that choice. That means that, if you can vote for 2 choices on that question, the percentages, subject to rounding error, can add up to 200%. Always round .5 up.<P>The output of the results for the ballot questions should be separated from each other by single empty lines, and there should be no empty line after the results for the last question.<P>No input line in the ballot description sections is longer than 64 characters, while every raw ballot is represented by a line that is exactly 101 characters long. The line lengths do not include the line terminator.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001003000000000000000">Sample Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P><PRE>

<P>William Robinson was completely puzzled in the music room; he could not find his triangle in his bag. He was sure that he had prepared it the night before. He remembered its clank when he had stepped on the school bus early that morning. No, not in his dream. His triangle was quite unique:no two sides had the same length, which made his favorite peculiar jingle. He insisted to the music teacher, Mr. Smith, that his triangle had probably been stolen by those aliens and thrown away into deep space.<P>Your mission is to help Will find his triangle in space. His triangle has been made invisible by the aliens, but candidate positions of its vertices are somehow known. You have to tell which three of them make his triangle. Having gone through worm-holes, the triangle may have changed its size. However, even in that case, all the sides are known to be enlarged or shrunk equally, that is, the transformed triangle is similar to the original.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The very first line of the input has an integer which is the number of data sets. Each data set gives data for one incident such as that of Will's.<P>The first line of each data set contains three decimals that give lengths of the sides of the original triangle, measured in centimeters. Three vertices of the original triangle are named P, Q, and R. Three decimals given in the first line correspond to the lengths of sides QR, RP, and PQ, in this order. They are separated by one or more space characters.<P>The second line of a data set has an integer which is the number of points in space to be considered as candidates for vertices. At least three and at most thirty points are considered.<P>The rest of the data set are lines containing coordinates of candidate points, in light years. Each line has three decimals, corresponding to x, y, and z coordinates, separated by one or more space characters. Points are numbered in the order of their appearances, starting from one.<P>Among all the triangles formed by three of the given points, only one of them is similar to the original, that is, ratios of the lengths of any two sides are equal to the corresponding ratios of the original allowing an error of less than 0.01 percent. Other triangles have some of the ratios different from the original by at least 0.1 percent.<P>The origin of the coordinate system is not the center of the earth but the center of our galaxy. Note that negative coordinate values may appear here. As they are all within or close to our galaxy, coordinate values are less than one hundred thousand light years.

<P>A professor of anthropology was interested in people living in isolated islands and their history. He collected their family trees to conduct some anthropological experiment. For the experiment, he needed to process the family trees with a computer. For that purpose he translated them into text files. The following is an example of a text file representing a family tree.<P><PRE>
John
 Robert
  Frank
  Andrew
 Nancy
  David
</PRE><P>Each line contains the given name of a person. The name in the first line is the oldest ancestor in this family tree. The family tree contains only the descendants of the oldest ancestor. Their husbands and wives are not shown in the family tree. The children of a person are indented with one more space than the parent. For example, Robert and Nancy are the children of John, and Frank and Andrew are the children of Robert. David is indented with one more space than Robert, but he is not a child of Robert, but of Nancy. To represent a family tree in this way, the professor excluded some people from the family trees so that no one had both parents in a family tree.<P>For the experiment, the professor also collected documents of the families and extracted the set of statements about relations of two persons in each family tree. The following are some examples of statements about the family above.<P><PRE>
John is the parent of Robert.
Robert is a sibling of Nancy.
David is a descendant of Robert.
</PRE><P>For the experiment, he needs to check whether each statement is true or not. For example, the first two statements above are true and the last statement is false. Since this task is tedious, he would like to check it by a computer program.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several data sets.

His task is to move a cargo to a goal by repeatedly pushing the cargo in the warehouse, of course, without breaking the walls and the pillars of the warehouse.<P>There may be some pillars in the warehouse. Except for the locations of the pillars, the floor of the warehouse is paved with square tiles whose size fits with the cargo. Each pillar occupies the same area as a tile.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="672" HEIGHT="758" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2147.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p2147.eps}"></DIV><P>Initially, the cargo is on the center of a tile. With one push, he can move the cargo onto the center of an adjacent tile if he is in proper position. The tile onto which he will move the cargo must be one of (at most) four tiles (i.e., east, west, north or south) adjacent to the tile where the cargo is present.<P>To push, he must also be on the tile adjacent to the present tile. He can only push the cargo in the same direction as he faces to it and he cannot pull it. So, when the cargo is on the tile next to a wall (or a pillar), he can only move it along the wall (or the pillar). Furthermore, once he places it on a corner tile, he cannot move it anymore.<P>He can change his position, if there is a path to the position without obstacles (such as the cargo and pillars) in the way. The goal is not an obstacle. In addition, he can move only in the four directions (i.e., east, west, north or south) and change his direction only at the center of a tile.<P>As he is not so young, he wants to save his energy by keeping the number of required pushes as small as possible. But he does not mind the count of his pedometer, because walking is very light exercise for him.<P>Your job is to write a program that outputs the minimum number of pushes required to move the cargo to the goal, if ever possible.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of multiple maps, each representing the size and the arrangement of the warehouse.

<P>
Bill is a boss of security guards. He has pride in that his men put on wearable computers on their
duty. At the same time, it is his headache that capacities of commercially available batteries are
far too small to support those computers all day long. His men come back to the office to charge
up their batteries and spend idle time until its completion. Bill has only one battery charger in
the office because it is very expensive.

<P>
Bill suspects that his men spend much idle time waiting in a queue for the charger. If it is the
case, Bill had better introduce another charger. Bill knows that his men are honest in some
sense and blindly follow any given instructions or rules. Such a simple-minded way of life may
lead to longer waiting time, but they cannot change their behavioral pattern.

<P>
Each battery has a data sheet attached on it that indicates the best pattern of charging and
consuming cycle. The pattern is given as a sequence of pairs of consuming time and charging
time. The data sheet says the pattern should be followed cyclically to keep the battery in quality.
A guard, trying to follow the suggested cycle strictly, will come back to the office exactly when
the consuming time passes out, stay there until the battery has been charged for the exact time
period indicated, and then go back to his beat.

<P>
The guards are quite punctual. They spend not a second more in the office than the time
necessary for charging up their batteries. They will wait in a queue, however, if the charger is
occupied by another guard, exactly on first-come-first-served basis. When two or more guards
come back to the office at the same instance of time, they line up in the order of their identifi-
cation numbers, and, each of them, one by one in the order of that line, judges if he can use the
charger and, if not, goes into the queue. They do these actions in an instant.

<P>
Your mission is to write a program that simulates those situations like Bill's and reports how
much time is wasted in waiting for the charger.

<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
The input consists of one or more data sets for simulation.

<P>
The first line of a data set consists of two positive integers separated by a space character:the
number of guards and the simulation duration. The number of guards does not exceed one
hundred. The guards have their identification numbers starting from one up to the number of
guards. The simulation duration is measured in minutes, and is at most one week, i.e., 10080
(min.).

<P>
Patterns for batteries possessed by the guards follow the first line. For each guard, in the order
of identification number, appears the pattern indicated on the data sheet attached to his battery.
A pattern is a sequence of positive integers, whose length is a multiple of two and does not exceed
fifty. The numbers in the sequence show consuming time and charging time alternately. Those
times are also given in minutes and are at most one day, i.e., 1440 (min.). A space character or
a newline follows each number. A pattern is terminated with an additional zero followed by a
newline.

<P>
Each data set is terminated with an additional empty line. The input is terminated with an
additional line that contains two zeros separated by a space character.

<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
For each data set your program should simulate up to the given duration. Each guard should
repeat consuming of his battery (i.e., being on his beat) and charging of his battery according
to the given pattern cyclically. At the beginning, all the guards start their cycle simultaneously,
that is, they start their beats and, thus, start their first consuming period.

<P>
For each data set, your program should produce one line containing the total wait time of the
guards in the queue up to the time when the simulation duration runs out. The output should
not contain any other characters.

<P>
For example, consider a data set:

<P>
<PRE>
3 25
3 1 2 1 4 1 0
1 1 0
2 1 3 2 0
</PRE> 

<P>
The guard 1 tries to repeat 3 min. consuming, 1 min. charging, 2 min. consuming, 1 min.
charging, 4 min. consuming, and 1 min. charging, cyclically. Yet he has to wait sometimes to
use the charger, when he is on his duty together with the other guards 2 and 3. Thus, the actual
behavior of the guards looks like:

<P>
<PRE>
         0         10        20
         |    |    |    |    |    |
guard 1: ***.**.****.***.**-.****.
guard 2: *.*-.*-.*-.*.*.*.*--.*.*-
guard 3: **.***--..**-.***..**.***
</PRE> 
where ``<TT>*</TT>" represents a minute spent for consuming, ``<TT>.</TT>" for charging, and ``<TT>-</TT>" for waiting in the queue. At time 3, the guards 1 and 2 came back to the office and the guard 1 started charging while the guard 2 went into the queue. At time 6, all the guards came back to the office and the guard 1 started charging while the others went to the queue. When the charger got available at time 7, the guard 2 started charging, leaving the guard 3 in the queue. All those happened are consequences of rules stated above. And the total time wasted in waiting for the charger becomes 10 minutes.

<P>
Haven't you ever thought that programs written in Java, C++, Pascal, or any other modern
computer languages look rather sparse? Although most editors provide sufficient screen space
for at least 80 characters or so in a line, the average number of significant characters occurring
in a line is just a fraction. Today, people usually prefer readability of programs to efficient use
of screen real estate.

<P>
Dr. Faust, a radical computer scientist, believes that editors for real programmers shall be more
space efficient. He has been doing research on saving space and invented various techniques
for many years, but he has reached the point where no more essential improvements will be
expected with his own ideas.

<P>
After long thought, he has finally decided to take the ultimate but forbidden approach. He does
not hesitate to sacrifice anything for his ambition, and asks a devil to give him supernatural
intellectual powers in exchange with his soul. With the transcendental knowledge and ability,
the devil provides new algorithms and data structures for space efficient implementations of
editors.

<P>
The editor implemented with those evil techniques is beyond human imaginations and behaves
somehow strange. The mighty devil Dr. Faust asks happens to be the devil of gravity. The
editor under its control saves space with magical magnetic and gravitational forces.

<P>
Your mission is to defeat Dr. Faust by re-implementing this strange editor without any help
of the devil. At first glance, the editor looks like an ordinary text editor. It presents texts in
two-dimensional layouts and accepts editing commands including those of cursor movements and
character insertions and deletions. A text handled by the devil's editor, however, is partitioned
into text segments, each of which is a horizontal block of non-blank characters. In the following
figure, for instance, four text segments ``<TT>abcdef</TT>", ``<TT>ghijkl</TT>", ``<TT>mnop</TT>", ``<TT>qrstuvw</TT>" are present and the first two are placed in the same row.

<P>
<PRE>
abcdef  ghijkl
     mnop
qrstuvw
</PRE> 

<P>
The editor has the following unique features.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>A text segment without any supporting segments in the row immediately below it falls by the evil gravitational force.
</LI>
<LI>Text segments in the same row and contiguous to each other are concatenated by the evil magnetic force.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
For instance, if characters in the segment ``<TT>mnop</TT>" in the previous example are deleted, the two
segments on top of it fall and we have the following.

<P>
<PRE>
abcdef
qrstuvw ghijkl
</PRE> 

<P>
After that, if ``<TT>x</TT>" is added at the tail (i.e., the right next of the rightmost column) of the segment
``<TT>qrstuvw</TT>", the two segments in the bottom row are concatenated.

<P>
<PRE>
abcdef
qrstuvwxghijkl
</PRE> 

<P>
Now we have two text segments in this figure. By this way, the editor saves screen space but demands the users' extraordinary intellectual power.

<P>
In general, after a command execution, the following rules are applied, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> is a text segment, left(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>) and right(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>) are the leftmost and rightmost columns of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>, respectively, and row(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>) is the row number of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>If the columns from left(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>) to right(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>) in the row numbered row(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>)-1 (i.e., the row just below <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>) are empty (i.e., any characters of any text segments do not exist there), <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> is pulled down to row(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>)-1 vertically, preserving its column position. If the same ranges in row(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>)-2, row(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>)-3, and so on are also empty, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> is further pulled down again and again. This process terminates sooner or later since the editor has the ultimate bottom, the row whose number is zero.
</LI>
<LI>If two text segments <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> are in the same row and right(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>) +1 = left(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>), that is, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> starts at the right next column of the rightmost character of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> are automatically concatenated to form a single text segment, which starts at left(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN>) and ends at right(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>). Of course, the new segment is still in the original row.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Note that any text segment has at least one character. Note also that the first rule is applied prior to any application of the second rule. This means that no concatenation may occur while falling segments exist. For instance, consider the following case.

<P>
<PRE>
   dddddddd
   cccccccc
bbbb
aaa
</PRE> 

<P>
If the last character of the text segment ``<TT>bbbb</TT>" is deleted, the concatenation rule is not applied
until the two segments ``<TT>cccccccc</TT>" and ``<TT>dddddddd</TT>" stop falling. This means that ``<TT>bbb</TT>" and
``<TT>cccccccc</TT>" are not concatenated.

<P>
The devil's editor has a cursor and it is always in a single text segment, which we call the current
segment. The cursor is at some character position of the current segment or otherwise at its
tail. Note that the cursor cannot be a support. For instance, in the previous example, even if
the cursor is at the last character of ``<TT>bbbb</TT>" and it stays at the same position after the deletion,
it cannot support ``<TT>cccccccc</TT>" and ``<TT>dddddddd</TT>" any more by solely itself and thus those two
segments shall fall. Finally, the cursor is at the leftmost ``<TT>d</TT>"

<P>
The editor accepts the following commands, each represented by a single character.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>F</TT>: Move the cursor forward (i.e., to the right) by one column in the current segment. If the cursor is at the tail of the current segment and thus it cannot move any more within the segment, an error occurs.
</LI>
<LI><TT>B</TT>: Move the cursor backward (i.e., to the left) by one column in the current segment. If the cursor is at the leftmost position of the current segment, an error occurs.
</LI>
<LI><TT>P</TT>: Move the cursor upward by one row. The column position of the cursor does not change. If the new position would be out of the legal cursor range of any existing text segment, an error occurs.
</LI>
<LI><TT>N</TT>: Move the cursor downward by one row. The column position of the cursor does not change. If the cursor is in the bottom row or the new position is out of the legal cursor range of any existing text segment, an error occurs.
</LI>
<LI><TT>D</TT>: Delete the character at the cursor position. If the cursor is at the tail of the current segment and so no character is there, an error occurs. If the cursor is at some character, it is deleted and the current segment becomes shorter by one character. Neither the beginning (i.e., leftmost) column of the current segment nor the column position of the cursor changes. However, if the current segment becomes empty, it is removed and the cursor falls by one row. If the new position would be out of the legal cursor range of any existing text segment, an error occurs.

<P>
Note that after executing this command, some text segments may lose their supports and be pulled down toward the hell. If the current segment falls, the cursor also falls with it.
</LI>
<LI><TT>C</TT>: Create a new segment of length one immediately above the current cursor position. It consists of a copy of the character under the cursor. If the cursor is at the tail, an error occurs. Also if the the position of the new segment is already occupied by another segment, an error occurs. After executing the command, the created segment becomes the new current segment and the column position of the cursor advances to the right by one column.
</LI>
<LI>Lowercase and numeric characters (`<TT>a</TT>' to `<TT>z</TT>' and `<TT>0</TT>' to `<TT>9</TT>'): Insert the character at the current cursor position. The current segment becomes longer by one character. The cursor moves forward by one column. The beginning column of the current segment does not change.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Once an error occurs, the entire editing session terminates abnormally.

structure at every biological clock by cell division and cell death. The leader may change depending on this physical change.<P>The most astonishing fact about the numoeba cell is that it contains an organic unit called <SPAN CLASS="textit">numbosome</SPAN>, which represents an odd integer within the range from 1 to 12,345,677. At every biological clock, the value of a numbosome changes from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> to a new value as follows:<P><OL><LI>The maximum odd factor of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3<I>n</I> + 1</SPAN> is calculated. This value can be obtained from <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3<I>n</I> + 1</SPAN> by repeating division by 2 while even. </LI><LI>If the resulting integer is greater than 12,345,678, then it is subtracted by 12,345,678. </LI></OL><P>For example, if the numbosome value of a cell is 13, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">13 <TT>x</TT> 3 + 1 = 40</SPAN> is divided by <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<SUP>3</SUP> = 8</SPAN> and a new numbosome value 5 is obtained. If the numbosome value of a cell is 11,111,111, it changes to 4,320,989, instead of 16,666,667. If <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3<I>n</I> + 1</SPAN> is a power of 2, yielding 1 as the result, it signifies the death of the cell as will be described below.<P>At every biological clock, the next numbosome value of every cell is calculated and the fate of the cell and thereby the fate of numoeba is determined according to the following steps.<P><OL><LI>A cell that is a leaf and increases its numbosome value is designated as a <SPAN CLASS="textit">candidate</SPAN> leaf.<P>A cell dies if its numbosome value becomes 1. If the dying cell is the leader of the numoeba, the numoeba dies as a whole. Otherwise, all the cells in the subtree from the dying cell (including itself) die. However, there is an exceptional case where the cells in the subtree do not necessarily die; if there is only one child cell of the dying non-leader cell, the child cell will replace the dying cell. Thus, a straight chain simply shrinks if its non-leader constituent dies.<P>For example, consider a numoeba with the leader A below.<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=11><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COL

<P>Dr. Extreme experimentally made an extremely precise telescope to investigate extremely curi- ous phenomena at an extremely distant place. In order to make the telescope so precise as to investigate phenomena at such an extremely distant place, even quite a small distortion is not allowed. However, he forgot the influence of the internal gas affected by low-frequency vibration of magnetic flux passing through the telescope. The cylinder of the telescope is not affected by the low-frequency vibration, but the internal gas is.<P>The cross section of the telescope forms a perfect circle. If he forms a coil by putting extremely thin wire along the (inner) circumference, he can measure (the average vertical component of) the temporal variation of magnetic flux:such measurement would be useful to estimate the influence. But points on the circumference at which the wire can be fixed are limited; furthermore, the number of special clips to fix the wire is also limited. To obtain the highest sensitivity, he wishes to form a coil of a polygon shape with the largest area by stringing the wire among carefully selected points on the circumference.<P>Your job is to write a program which reports the maximum area of all possible <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>-polygons (polygons with exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> vertices) each of whose vertices is one of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> points given on a circumference with a radius of 1.

Euclid, dwelt in Alexandria, still being convinced firmly that there is no Royal Road to Euclidean
Geometry yet, began to feel gradually, reading newspaper articles, watching TV programs, or
brainwashed by young students, that it might be possible to create such a discipline as 
e-Geometry or Geometry on the Internet. In an e-Geometry environment, he could timely discuss
geometry issues with many friends of his including Pythagoras, or he could upload new versions
of his unparalleled famous archive ``Elements of Geometry (Stoicheia)" on his WWW site. He
instantly made up his mind to join the Internet.

<P>
He started laying ether cable himself from the hub to his terminal in his uniquely shaped study.
He designed the cable route as short as possible.

<P>
Figure 1 is a plan of his study. Integers in a pair of parentheses like <TT>(0 0)</TT> are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>- and 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>-coordinates of the nearest pillar or hub or terminal. Between two adjacent pillars are walls
indicated by the solid lines. Suppose A is the position of the hub and B his terminal, then the
shortest cable may run as drawn with a broken line.

<P>
Your mission is to answer the sequence of the coordinates of turning points of the shortest cable
route including those of both ends A and B for each plan. So, you are to answer as:

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<TT>(1 1) (2 2) (8 4) (9 5)</TT>

<P>
Remember, however, that this is a house of Euclid, the founder and master of Euclidean Geom-
etry. The pillars, hub and terminal are ideal points of Euclidean Geometry. The walls and cable
are line segments in the sense of geometry. Accordingly, the cable may overlap the walls or the
pillars. Hence for Figures 2, 3 and 4, the answers should be as follows:(Hereafter, the layouts
of the study are given by means of the lists of the pillar coordinates.)

All values of coordinates are integers. Walls are parallel to either x- or y-axis. Walls turn right
or left at each pillar for which the coordinates are given. The coordinates of the pillars are given
in the order to look the inside of study to the left. From the last pillar in the list, the next wall
stretches to the first pillar. Every position of the pillar appears only once in the list. Each pillar
is connected to exactly two walls, one of which is parallel to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>-axis and the other to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>-axis. The
whole wall surrounds the study with single stroke closing line. No walls cross. No wall branches
exist. It is known that no independent walls or other obstacles are found inside the study. Only
one hub and one terminal exist inside the study for each plan, and their positions are always
different.

Given two numbers and the requested operation, you are to compute the result and print it in the form specified below. With addition and subtraction, the numbers are written below each other.

<P>ACM uses a&nbsp;new special technology of building its transceiver stations. This technology is called <EM>Modular Cuboid Architecture</EM> (<EM>MCA</EM>) and is covered by a&nbsp;patent of Lego company. All parts of the transceiver are shipped in unit blocks that have the form of cubes of exactly the same size. The cubes can be then connected to each other. The MCA is modular architecture, that means we can select preferred transceiver configuration and buy only those components we need.<P>The cubes must be always connected "face-to-face", i.e. the whole side of one cube is connected to the whole side of another cube. One cube can be thus connected to at most six other units. The resulting equipment, consisting of unit cubes is called <EM>The Bulk</EM> in the communication technology slang.<P>Sometimes, an&nbsp;old and unneeded bulk is condemned, put into a&nbsp;storage place, and replaced with a&nbsp;new one. It was recently found that ACM has many of such old bulks that just occupy space and are no longer needed. The director has decided that all such bulks must be disassembled to single pieces to save some space. Unfortunately, there is no documentation for the old bulks and nobody knows the exact number of pieces that form them. You are to write a&nbsp;computer program that takes the bulk description and computes the number of unit cubes.<P>Each bulk is described by its faces (sides). A&nbsp;special X-ray based machine was constructed that is able to localise all faces of the bulk in the space, even the inner faces, because the bulk can be partially hollow (it can contain empty spaces inside). But any bulk must be connected (i.e. it cannot drop into two pieces) and composed of whole unit cubes.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>There is a&nbsp;single positive integer <VAR>T</VAR> on the first line of input. It stands for the number of bulks to follow. Each bulk description begins with a&nbsp;line containing single positive integer <VAR>F</VAR>, 6 &lt;= <VAR>F</VAR> &lt;= 250, stating the number of faces. Then there are <VAR>F</VAR> lines, each containing one face description. All faces of the bulk are always listed, in any order. Any face may be divided into several distinct parts and described like if it was more faces. Faces do not overlap. Every face has one inner side and one outer side. No side can be "partially inner and partially outer".<P>Each face is described on a&nbsp;single line. The line begins with an&nbsp;integer number <VAR>P</VAR> stating the number of points that determine the face, 4 &lt;= <VAR>P</VAR> &lt;= 200. Then there are 3 <VAR>x P</VAR> numbers, coordinates of the points. Each point is described by three coordinates <VAR>X</VAR>,<VAR>Y</VAR>,<VAR>Z</VAR> (0 &lt;= <VAR>X</VAR>,<VAR>Y</VAR>,<VAR>Z</VAR> &lt;= 1000) separated by spaces. The points are separated from each other and from the number <VAR>P</VAR> by two space characters. These additional spaces were added to make the input more human readable. The face can be constructed by connecting the points in the specified order, plus connecting the last point with the first one.<P>The face is always composed of "unit squares", that means every edge runs either in <VAR>X</VAR>, <VAR>Y</VAR> or <VAR>Z</VAR>-axis direction. If we take any two neighbouring points <VAR>X</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>,<VAR>Y</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>,<VAR>Z</VAR><SUB>1</SUB> and <VAR>X</VAR><SUB>2</SUB>,<VAR>Y</VAR><SUB>2</SUB>,<VAR>Z</VAR><SUB>2</SUB>, then the points will always differ in exactly one of the three coordinates. I.e. it is either <VAR>X</VAR><SUB>1</SUB> &lt;&gt; <VAR>X</VAR><SUB>2</SUB>, or <VAR>Y</VAR><SUB>1</SUB> &lt;&gt; <VAR>Y</VAR><SUB>2</SUB>, or <VAR>Z</VAR><SUB>1</SUB> &lt;&gt; <VAR>Z</VAR><SUB>2</SUB>, other two coordinates are the same. Every face lies in an&nbsp;orthogonal plane, i.e. exactly one coordinate is always the same for all points of the face. The face outline will never touch nor cross itself.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your program must print a&nbsp;single line for every test case.

<P>You probably know those quizzes in Sunday magazines: given the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, what is the next number? Sometimes it is very easy to answer, sometimes it could be pretty hard. Because these "sequence problems" are very popular, ACM wants to implement them into the "Free Time" section of their new WAP portal.<P>ACM programmers have noticed that some of the quizzes can be solved by describing the sequence by polynomials. For example, the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 can be easily understood as a&nbsp;trivial polynomial. The next number is 6. But even more complex sequences, like 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, can be described by a&nbsp;polynomial. In this case, 1/2.<VAR>n</VAR><SUP>2</SUP>-1/2.<VAR>n</VAR>+1 can be used. Note that even if the members of the sequence are integers, polynomial coefficients may be any real numbers.<P>Polynomial is an&nbsp;expression in the following form:<BR><P></P><DIV align=center><VAR>P</VAR>(<VAR>n</VAR>) = <VAR>a</VAR><SUB><VAR>D</VAR></SUB>.<VAR>n</VAR><SUP><VAR>D</VAR></SUP>+<VAR>a</VAR><SUB><VAR>D</VAR>-1</SUB>.<VAR>n</VAR><SUP><VAR>D</VAR>-1</SUP>+...+<VAR>a</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>.<VAR>n</VAR>+<VAR>a</VAR><SUB>0</SUB></DIV><p><BR clear=all></p><P></P><p>. If <VAR>a</VAR><SUB><VAR>D</VAR></SUB> &lt;&gt; 0, the number <VAR>D</VAR> is called a&nbsp;<EM>degree</EM> of the polynomial. Note that constant function <VAR>P</VAR>(<VAR>n</VAR>) = <VAR>C</VAR> can be considered as polynomial of degree 0, and the zero function <VAR>P</VAR>(<VAR>n</VAR>) = 0 is usually defined to have degree -1.</p><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>There is a&nbsp;single positive integer <VAR>T</VAR> on the first line of input.

<P>Building the GSM network is a&nbsp;very expensive and complex task. Moreover, after the <EM>Base Transceiver Stations</EM> (<EM>BTS</EM>) are built and working, we need to perform many various measurements to determine the state of the network, and propose effective improvements to be made.<P>The ACM technicians have a&nbsp;special equipment for measuring the strength of electro-magnetic fields, the transceivers' power and quality of the signal. This equipment is packed into a&nbsp;huge knapsack and the technician must move with it from one BTS to another. Unfortunately, the knapsack have not enough memory for storing all of the measured values. It has a&nbsp;small cache only, that can store values for several seconds. Then the values must be transmitted to the BTS by an&nbsp;infrared connection (IRDA). The IRDA needs direct visibility between the technician and the BTS.<P>Your task is to find the path between two neighbouring BTSes such that at least one of those BTSes is always visible.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>There is a&nbsp;single positive integer <VAR>T</VAR> on the first line of input. It stands for the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of a&nbsp;town description. For simplicity, a&nbsp;town is modelled as a&nbsp;rectangular grid of <VAR>P x Q</VAR> square fields. Each field is exactly 1&nbsp;metre wide. For each field, a&nbsp;non-negative integer <VAR>Z</VAR><SUB><VAR>i</VAR>,<VAR>j</VAR></SUB> is given, representing the height of the terrain in that place, in metres. That means the town model is made of cubes, each of them being either solid or empty. There are no "half solid" cubes.<P>The first line of each test case contains two integer numbers <VAR>P</VAR> and <VAR>Q</VAR>, separated by a&nbsp;single space, 1 &lt;= <VAR>P</VAR>,<VAR>Q</VAR> &lt;= 200. Then there are <VAR>P</VAR> lines each containing <VAR>Q</VAR> integer numbers separated by a&nbsp;space. These numbers are <VAR>Z</VAR><SUB><VAR>i</VAR>,<VAR>j</VAR></SUB>, where 1 &lt;= <VAR>i</VAR> &lt;= <VAR>P</VAR>, 1 &lt;= <VAR>j</VAR> &lt;= <VAR>Q</VAR> and 0 &lt;= <VAR>Z</VAR><SUB><VAR>i</VAR>,<VAR>j</VAR></SUB> &lt;= 5000. After the terrain description, there are four numbers <VAR>R</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>, <VAR>C</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>, <VAR>R</VAR><SUB>2</SUB>, <VAR>C</VAR><SUB>2</SUB> on the last line of each test case. These numbers represent position of two BTSes, 1 &lt;= <VAR>R</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>,<VAR>R</VAR><SUB>2</SUB> &lt;= <VAR>P</VAR>, 1 &lt;= <VAR>C</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>,<VAR>C</VAR><SUB>2</SUB> &lt;= <VAR>Q</VAR>. The first coordinate (<VAR>R</VAR>) determines the row of the town, the second coordinate determines the column.<P>The technician is moving in steps (<EM>steps</EM> stands for <EM>Standard Technician's Elementary Positional Shift</EM>). Each step is made between two neighbouring square fields. That means the step is always in North, South, West or East direction. It is not possible to move diagonally. The step between two fields <VAR>A</VAR> and <VAR>B</VAR> (step from <VAR>A</VAR> to <VAR>B</VAR>) is allowed only if the height of the terrain in the field <VAR>B</VAR> is not very different from the height in the field <VAR>A</VAR>. The technician can climb at most 1&nbsp;metre up or descend at most 3&nbsp;metres down in a&nbsp;single step.<P>At the end of each step, at least one of the two BTSes must be visible. However, there can be some point "in the middle of the step" where no BTS is visible. This is OK and the data is handled by the cache. The BTS is considered visible, if there is a&nbsp;direct visibility between the unit cube just above the terrain on the BTSes coordinates and the cube just above the terrain on the square field, where the technician is. Direct visibility between two cubes means that the line connecting the centres of the two cubes does not intersect any solid cube. However, the line can touch any number of solid cubes. In other words, consider both the BTS and the technician being points exactly half metre above the surface and in the centre of the appropriate square field.<P>Note that the IRDA beam can go between two cubes that touch each other by their edge, although there is no space between them. It is because such a&nbsp;beam touches both of these two cubes but does not intersect any of them. See the last test case of the sample input for an&nbsp;example of such a&nbsp;situation.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>You are to find the shortest possible path meeting the above criteria.

      <P>The most important activity of ACM is the GSM network. As the mobile 
      phone operator, ACM must build its own transmitting stations. It is very 
      important to compute the exact behaviour of electro-magnetic waves. 
      Unfortunately, prediction of electro-magnetic fields is a&nbsp;very 
      complex task and the formulas describing them are very long and 
      hard-to-read. For example, below are the Maxwell's Equations describing 
      the basic laws of electrical engineering.

<p>ACM has designed its own computer 
      system that can make some field computations and produce results in the 
      form of mathematic expressions. Unfortunately, by generating the 
      expression in several steps, there are always some unneeded parentheses 
      inside the expression. Your task is to take these partial results and make 
      them "nice" by removing all unnecessary parentheses. </p>

<P>The most important part of a&nbsp;GSM network is so called <EM>Base Transceiver Station</EM> (<EM>BTS</EM>). These transceivers form the areas called <EM>cells</EM> (this term gave the name to the cellular phone) and every phone connects to the BTS with the strongest signal (in a&nbsp;little simplified view). Of course, BTSes need some attention and technicians need to check their function periodically.<P>ACM technicians faced a&nbsp;very interesting problem recently. Given a&nbsp;set of BTSes to visit, they needed to find the shortest path to visit all of the given points and return back to the central company building. Programmers have spent several months studying this problem but with no results. They were unable to find the solution fast enough. After a&nbsp;long time, one of the programmers found this problem in a&nbsp;conference article. Unfortunately, he found that the problem is so called "Travelling Salesman Problem" and it is very hard to solve. If we have <VAR>N</VAR> BTSes to be visited, we can visit them in any order, giving us <VAR>N</VAR>! possibilities to examine. The function expressing that number is called factorial and can be computed as a&nbsp;product 1.2.3.4....<VAR>N</VAR>. The number is very high even for a&nbsp;relatively small <VAR>N</VAR>.<P>The programmers understood they had no chance to solve the problem. But because they have already received the research grant from the government, they needed to continue with their studies and produce at least <EM>some</EM> results. So they started to study behaviour of the factorial function.<P>For example, they defined the function <VAR>Z</VAR>. For any positive integer <VAR>N</VAR>, <VAR>Z</VAR>(<VAR>N</VAR>) is the number of zeros at the end of the decimal form of number <VAR>N</VAR>!. They noticed that this function never decreases. If we have two numbers <VAR>N</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>&lt;<VAR>N</VAR><SUB>2</SUB>, then <VAR>Z</VAR>(<VAR>N</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>) &lt;= <VAR>Z</VAR>(<VAR>N</VAR><SUB>2</SUB>). It is because we can never "lose" any trailing zero by multiplying by any positive number. We can only get new and new zeros. The function <VAR>Z</VAR> is very interesting, so we need a&nbsp;computer program that can determine its value efficiently.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>There is a&nbsp;single positive integer <VAR>T</VAR> on the first line of input.

<P>If you want to buy a&nbsp;new cellular phone, there are many various types to choose from. To decide which one is the best for you, you have to consider several important things: its size and weight, battery capacity, WAP support, colour, price. One of the most important things is also the list of games the phone provides. Nokia is one of the most successful phone makers because of its famous Snake and Snake&nbsp;II. ACM wants to make and sell its own phone and they need to program several games for it. One of them is Master-Mind, the famous board logical game.<P>The game is played between two players. One of them chooses a&nbsp;<EM>secret code</EM> consisting of <VAR>P</VAR>&nbsp;ordered pins, each of them having one of the predefined set of <VAR>C</VAR>&nbsp;colours. The goal of the second player is to guess that secret sequence of colours. Some colours may not appear in the code, some colours may appear more than once.<P>The player makes guesses, which are formed in the same way as the secret code. After each guess, he/she is provided with an&nbsp;information on how successful the guess was. This feedback is called a&nbsp;<EM>hint</EM>. Each hint consists of <VAR>B</VAR> black points and <VAR>W</VAR> white points. The black point stands for every pin that was guessed right, i.e. the right colour was put on the right position. The white point means right colour but on the wrong position. For example, if the secret code is "white, yellow, red, blue, white" and the guess was "white, red, white, white, blue", the hint would consist of one black point (for the white on the first position) and three white points (for the other white, red and blue colours). The goal is to guess the sequence with the minimal number of hints.<P>The new ACM phone should have the possibility to play both roles. It can make the secret code and give hints, but it can also make its own guesses. Your goal is to write a&nbsp;program for the latter case, that means a&nbsp;program that makes Master-Mind guesses.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>There is a&nbsp;single positive integer <VAR>T</VAR> on the first line of input. It stands for the number of test cases to follow. Each test case describes one game situation and you are to make a&nbsp;guess. On the first line of each test case, there are three integer numbers, <VAR>P</VAR>, <VAR>C</VAR> and <VAR>M</VAR>. <VAR>P</VAR> ( 1 &lt;= <VAR>P</VAR> &lt;= 10) is the number of pins, <VAR>C</VAR> (1 &lt;= <VAR>C</VAR> &lt;= 100) is the number of colours, and <VAR>M</VAR> (1 &lt;= <VAR>M</VAR> &lt;= 100) is the number of already played guesses.<P>Then there are 2 <VAR>x M</VAR> lines, two lines for every guess. At the first line of each guess, there are <VAR>P</VAR> integer numbers representing colours of the guess. Each colour is represented by a&nbsp;number <VAR>G</VAR><SUB><VAR>i</VAR></SUB>, 1 &lt;= <VAR>G</VAR><SUB><VAR>i</VAR></SUB> &lt;= <VAR>C</VAR>. The second line contains two integer numbers, <VAR>B</VAR> and <VAR>W</VAR>, stating for the number of black and white points given by the corresponding hint.<P>Let's have a&nbsp;secret code <VAR>S</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>, <VAR>S</VAR><SUB>2</SUB>, ... <VAR>S</VAR><SUB><VAR>P</VAR></SUB> and the guess <VAR>G</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>, <VAR>G</VAR><SUB>2</SUB>, ... <VAR>G</VAR><SUB><VAR>P</VAR></SUB>.

      <P>Every customer sometimes needs help with new and unusual products. 
      Therefore, hotline service is very important for every company. We need 
      a&nbsp;single phone number where the customer can always find 
      a&nbsp;friendly voice ready to help with anything. On the other hand, many 
      people are needed to serve as hotline operators, and human resources are 
      always very expensive. Moreover, it is not easy to pretend "friendly 
      voice" at 4am and explain to a&nbsp;drunken man that you are really unable 
      to give him the number to House of Parliament. It was also found that some 
      of the questions repeat very often and it is very annoying to answer them 
      again and again. 
      <P>ACM is a&nbsp;modern company, wanting to solve its hotline problem. 
      They want to decrease the number of human operators by creating 
      a&nbsp;complex software system that would be able to answer most common 
      questions. The customer's voice is analysed by a&nbsp;special Voice 
      Recognition Module (VRM) and converted to a&nbsp;plain text. The text is 
      then taken by an Artificial Automatic Adaptive Answering Algorithm 
      (AAAAA). The most common questions are recognised and answered 
      automatically. The replies are then converted to a&nbsp;sound by 
      Text-to-Speech Module (TTS). 
      <P>You are to write the AAAAA module. Because your algorithm should be 
      adaptive, it has no explicit knowledge base. But it must be able to listen 
      to sentences in English and remember the mentioned facts. Whenever the 
      question is asked about such a&nbsp;fact, the system has to answer it 
      properly. The VRM and TTS modules are already implemented, so the input 
      and output of AAAAA will be in the text form.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>


      <P>There is a&nbsp;single positive integer <VAR>T</VAR> on the first line 
      of input. It stands for the number of dialogues to follow. Each dialogue 
      consists of zero or more lines, each of them containing one sentence: 
      either statement or question. The statement ends with a&nbsp;dot character 
      (<TT>.</TT>), the question ends with a&nbsp;question mark (<TT>?</TT>). No 
      statement will appear more than once, however the questions can be 
      repeated. There is one extra line after each dialogue. That line ends with 
      an&nbsp;exclamation mark (<TT>!</TT>). 
      <P>Sentences can contain words, spaces and punctuation characters (such as 
      commas, colons, semicolons etc.). All words contain only letters of 
      English alphabet and are case-sensitive. That means the same word is 
      always written the same way, usually in lowercase. Acronyms, names and 
      some other words can begin with capital letters. For simplicity, all 
      sentences begin with a&nbsp;lowercase letter. Only if the first word 
      should be written with a&nbsp;capital, the sentence begins with 
      a&nbsp;capital letter. There are no unneeded spaces between words. No line 
      will have more than 100 characters. There will be at most 100 statements 
      per each test case. 
      <P>
      <H3>Statements</H3>
      <P>Each statement has one of the following two forms ( 
      <IMG 
	  src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2160.gif width="12" height="6"> denotes a&nbsp;space): <BR><I>subject</I>

	  src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2160.gif width="12" height="6"> <I>object</I>] <TT>.</TT>
      <BR><I>subject</I> 
	  <IMG src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2160.gif width="12" height="6">
      <TT>don't</TT>|<TT>doesn't</TT>

      <I>predicate</I> [ 
	  <IMG src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2160.gif width="12" height="6"> <I>object</I>]
      <TT>.</TT> 
      <P>The square brackets mark an&nbsp;optional part, the vertical line two 
      possible variants. Subject is a&nbsp;single word, noun or pronoun in 
      singular. Predicate is a&nbsp;verb (single word) denoting some activity. 
      Object can be any text. Object does not contain any dots. Any pair "verb + 
      object" determines unique activity. The same verb with different objects 
      makes different independent activities, i.e. the different and independent 
      meaning of the sentence. Sentence without any object can be considered as 
      sentence with an&nbsp;empty object. The verb without an&nbsp;object has 
      different and independent meaning than the same verb with any non-empty 
      object. 
      <P>The first variant of sentence denotes a&nbsp;positive statement. The 
      word "<I>predicate</I>[<TT>s</TT>]" means verb that matches the subject of 
      the sentence. If the subject is "<TT>I</TT>" or "<TT>you</TT>", the verb 
      has the same form as the infinitive. With any other subject, the letter 
      "<TT>s</TT>" is appended on the end of the verb. Assume there are no 
      irregular verbs. 
      <P>The second variant is a&nbsp;negative statement. Verb "<TT>don't</TT>" 
      or "<TT>doesn't</TT>" must also match the subject. The form 
      "<TT>don't</TT>" is used with either "<TT>I</TT>" or "<TT>you</TT>", 
      "<TT>doesn't</TT>" is used in any other case. 
      <P>A&nbsp;special generic subject "<TT>everybody</TT>" can be used. It 
      means the activity holds for any subject. Other special subject is 
      "<TT>nobody</TT>". Such sentence also holds for any subject, but its 
      meaning is negative. Both of these generic subjects can be used with the 
      first variant only (without "<TT>doesn't</TT>"). The sentence "<TT>nobody 
      likes something</TT>" is exactly equal to "<TT>everybody doesn't like 
      something</TT>", except the latter form will never occur in the input. 
      <P>
      <H3>Questions</H3>
      <P>Each question has one of the following three forms: 
      <DL compact>
        <DT>1. 
        <DD><TT>do</TT>|<TT>does</TT>

        <DT>2.

        <DD><TT>what</TT> 
		<IMG src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2160.gif width="12" height="6">
        <TT>do</TT>|<TT>does</TT> 
		<IMG src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2160.gif width="12" height="6">
        <I>subject</I> <TT>do</TT> <TT>?</TT> </DD></DL>
      <P>The word "<TT>do</TT>|<TT>does</TT>" always matches the subject 
      ("<TT>do I?</TT>", "<TT>do you?</TT>", "<TT>does</TT> any other 
      subject?"). In the second type of question, predicate always matches the 
      word "<TT>who</TT>", i.e. the "<TT>s</TT>" is always appended. Generic 
      subjects cannot be used in questions.

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

      <P>For each dialogue, your program must output the line <TT>Dialogue 
      #</TT><VAR>D</VAR><TT>:</TT>, where <VAR>D</VAR> is the sequence number of 
      dialogue, starting with 1. Then print exactly three lines for every 
      question: the first line repeats the question, the second line contains 
      the answer, and the third line is empty. Print nothing for statements. 
      After each dialogue, print the same line with an&nbsp;exclamation mark 
      that was in the input. Then print one extra empty line. Empty line 
      contains a&nbsp;new-line character only. 
      <P>The answer must be properly formated to be accepted by a&nbsp;TTS 
      module. Only the statements appearing in the input before the answer are 
      used for the corresponding reply. If there is any contradiction among 
      statements, the reply is always <TT>I am abroad.</TT>. If the question and 
      statements consider the special subject "<TT>you</TT>", it must be 
      replaced with "<TT>I</TT>" in the answer. If the question considers 
      special subject "<TT>I</TT>", it must be replaced with "<TT>you</TT>" in

<P>Most of you have probably tried to type an&nbsp;SMS message on the keypad of a&nbsp;cellular phone. It is sometimes very annoying to write longer messages, because one key must be usually pressed several times to produce a&nbsp;single letter. It is due to a&nbsp;low number of keys on the keypad. Typical phone has twelve keys only (and maybe some other control keys that are not used for typing). Moreover, only eight keys are used for typing 26&nbsp;letters of an&nbsp;English alphabet. The standard assignment of letters on the keypad is shown in the left picture:<P align=center><img src=p2161a.gif><P>There are 3 or 4 letters assigned to each key. If you want the first letter of any group, you press that key once. If you want the second letter, you have to press the key twice. For other letters, the key must be pressed three or four times. The authors of the keyboard did not try to optimise the layout for minimal number of keystrokes. Instead, they preferred the even distribution of letters among the keys. Unfortunately, some letters are more frequent than others. Some of these frequent letters are placed on the third or even fourth place on the standard keyboard. For example, <TT>S</TT> is a&nbsp;very common letter in an&nbsp;English alphabet, and we need four keystrokes to type it. If the assignment of characters was like in the right picture, the keyboard would be much more comfortable for typing average English texts.<P>ACM have decided to put an&nbsp;optimised version of the keyboard on its new cellular phone. Now they need a&nbsp;computer program that will find an&nbsp;optimal layout for the given letter frequency. We need to preserve alphabetical order of letters, because the user would be confused if the letters were mixed. But we can assign any number of letters to a&nbsp;single key.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>There is a&nbsp;single positive integer <VAR>T</VAR> on the first line of input. It stands for the number of test cases to follow.

Then there are two lines. The first one contains exactly <VAR>K</VAR> characters each representing a&nbsp;name of one key. The second line contains exactly <VAR>L</VAR> characters representing names of letters of an&nbsp;alphabet. Keys and letters are represented by digits, letters (which are case-sensitive), or any punctuation characters (ASCII code between 33 and 126 inclusively). No two keys have the same character, no two letters are the same. However, the name of a&nbsp;letter can be used also as a&nbsp;name for a&nbsp;key.<P>After those two lines, there are exactly <VAR>L</VAR> lines each containing exactly one positive integer <VAR>F</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>, <VAR>F</VAR><SUB>2</SUB>, ... <VAR>F</VAR><SUB><VAR>L</VAR></SUB>. These numbers determine the frequency of every letter, starting with the first one and continuing with the others sequentially. The higher number means the more common letter.

<p>A Strange Tree (S-tree) over the variable set X<sub>n</sub>={x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>} is a complete binary tree representing a Boolean function f: {0,1}^n -> {0,1}. Each of the S-tree's nodes has a depth, defined as the number of nodes in the path from the root to itself minus 1 (so the root has depth 0). The depth of any node in an S-tree is at most n. The nodes with depth less than n are called non-terminal nodes, each having two children: the right child and the left child. Each non-terminal node is labeled with some variable x<sub>i</sub> from the variable set X<sub>n</sub>. All non-terminal nodes with the same depth are labeled with the same variable, and non-terminal nodes with different depth are labeled with different variables. So, there is a unique variable x<sub>i0</sub> corresponding to the root, a unique variable x<sub>i1</sub> corresponding to the nodes with depth 1, and so on. The sequence of the variables x<sub>i0</sub>, x<sub>i1</sub>, ..., x<sub>in-1 </sub>is called the variable ordering. The nodes having depth n are called terminal nodes. They have no children and are labeled with either 0 or 1. Note that the variable ordering and the distribution of 0's and 1's on terminal nodes are sufficient to completely describe an S-tree.</p><p>As stated earlier, each S-tree represents a Boolean function f. If you have an S-tree and values for the variables x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>, then it is quite simple to evaluate f(x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>): Start at the root and repeat the following steps: if the node you are at is labeled with a variable x<sub>i</sub>, then depending on whether the value of x<sub>i</sub> is 1 or 0, you go to its right or left child, respectively. Once you reach a terminal node, its label gives the value of the function.</p><pre>

Each description begins with a line containing a single integer n; 1 <= n <= 7, the depth of 
the S-tree. This is followed by a line describing the variable ordering of the S-tree.
The format of that line is x<sub>i1</sub> x<sub>i2</sub> ... x<sub>i</sub>n. (There will be exactly n different single

this line would look as follows </p>

<p>In the next line the distribution of 0's and 1's over the terminal nodes is given.
There will be exactly 2^n characters (each of which can be 0 or 1), followed by the
new-line character. The characters are given in the order in which they appear in
the S-tree, the first character corresponds to the leftmost terminal node of the
S-tree, the last one to its rightmost terminal node. </p>

<p>The next line contains a single integer m, the number of VVAs, followed by m lines
describing them. Each of the m lines contains exactly n characters (each of which can

<p>A local cable network is planning to expand their services to a neighboring city. For that, a transmission center is being built and a cable net connecting the new clients has to be installed. Each client has to be connected to the center in the cable net.</p><p>The network organized a survey and has now the addresses of all potential clients. Also it has an estimate on the cost of installing each cable link through the city.</p><p>The network board of directors has decided to offer the following initial subscription package: Each new client will pay a fixed subscription fee and will get the first three months of service for free. This ensures a <b>potential initial capital</b> for building the cable net, which is simply the number of potential clients (according to the survey) multiplied by the subscription fee.</p><p>The decision on what links to build in this first phase will be done according to the following. A set of links induces a <b>loss in the potential initial capital</b>, defined as <i>l + (t * d)</i>, where l is the cost of installing the links in the set, t is the subscription fee and d is the number of potential clients that are not connected to the center by this set of links. The board of directors decided they will build a set of links that induces a loss as small as possible in the potential initial capital.</p><p>Your job is to write a program to compute the minimum possible loss in the potential initial capital. For that, you are given the location of each potential client as well as the center location. Also, you are given the costs of all possible net links and the value of the subscription fee.</p><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>The input file contains the description of several instances.

of potential clients and t representing the subscription fee. Each potential client is identified by a 
number between 1 and n while the center is identified by 0. Next, there is a line for each i from 0

<p>You have three jars containing water. Each jar has associated a capacity indicating the maximum amount of water it can contain. Your wish is to have a certain amount of water in each jar. The initial content of each jar, its capacity, and the desired content, are all non negative integers; in addition, the capacities are between 1 and 150. You have nothing but the jars to help you in achieving your goal. So the only way to obtain the desired content in each jar is to make a sequence of movements of water. In a movement of water you pour a certain amount of water from one jar to another jar. We call the first jar source and the second jar destination. While moving water two situations can occur: If the current content of the source jar is not enough to complete the capacity of the destination jar, then all the water contained in the source jar is moved to the destination jar; otherwise, only the exact amount of water needed to complete the destination jar is moved from the source jar.

<p>Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) was one of the best abstract artists of the century. His simple yet elegant designs were intentionally restricted to use only straight lines and a few colors. His artwork reflects an idealized view of reality, one which has perfect harmony and balance.</p><p>Armando, a Latin American businessman, wants to create and sell fake Mondrian pictures. Since Mondrian's designs are based on a few simple rules, he hopes to build a machine that can mass-produce different Mondrian pictures and sell them as originals.</p><p>Mondrian's rules are very simple:</p><p>1. only black, white, red, blue and yellow colors can be used.</p><p>2. the painting can only contain rectangles, with sides parallel to the borders of the canvas. Lines that are not part of the border of a rectangle are not allowed. The following four examples do not fulfill this rule:</p><img src=p2167.jpg><p>The top-left painting contains a shape that is not a rectangle (the shape that is outside the central square). In the top-right painting every shape is a rectangle, but there are lines that are not part of the border of any rectangle. Bottom-left painting contains a shape that is not a rectangle (the inverted L). Bottom-right painting contains a line that is not part of the border of any rectangle. In the figure we also include a real (well, sort of) Mondrian (Composition with red, yellow, and blue, 1928).</p><p>3. Borders of the rectangles can only be painted in black. Rectangles can only be painted in white, red, blue or yellow. The borders of the canvas are considered to be already painted in black.</p><p>4. Two adjacent rectangles (that is, two rectangles that share a segment of their borders) cannot have the same color, unless they are painted in white.</p><p>The machine Armando has devised receives a set of instructions to draw the painting. Your task is to program an algorithm that will tell (before the machine begins to perform Armando's instructions) whether these instructions correspond to a picture that fulfills Mondrian's rules, and how much paint he will need.</p><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>The input file contains a set of test cases. Each test case is described in several lines, and contains Armando's instructions for one painting. There are two types of instructions: instructions that indicate the drawing of a line, and instructions that indicate the painting of a rectangle. Each test case of the input file starts with a line containing four integer values w, h, n, m. The values w and h represent the width and height of the canvas, respectively; these values are between 1 and 10000. The value n is the number of instructions for drawing lines, while m is the number of instructions for painting rectangles; these values are between 0 and 1000. The test case continues with n lines containing the instructions for drawing lines, each instruction in a separate line of the file. Each instruction consists of four integer values x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub> and x<sub>4</sub>, where (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>) and (x<sub>3</sub>, x<sub>4</sub>) are the coordinates of the end points of the line. Lines are always horizontal or vertical. The lower left corner of the canvas has coordinates (0,0). Instructions can result in a line or part of a line being drawn more than once. The test case ends with m lines containing the instructions for painting rectangles, each one in a separate line of the input file. Each instruction specifies two integer values x and y, as well as a letter c in the set {r, b, y} (r means red, b is blue and y is yellow).

<P>In this problem you will implement the Merkle-Hellman Knapsack cryptosystem. The encryption and decryption algorithms are based on solving a knapsack problem. The knapsack problem consists of finding a way to select some of the items to be packed such that their sum (the amount of space they take up) exactly equals the knapsack capacity (the target). Formally the knapsack problems is as follows: given a set <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I> = {<I>a</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>a</I><SUB>2</SUB>,...<I>a</I><SUB>n</SUB>}</SPAN> and a target sum <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>, where each <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I><SUB>i</SUB><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2172img1.png ALT="$ \ge$"> 0</SPAN>, is there a selection vector <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I> = {<I>v</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>v</I><SUB>2</SUB>,...<I>v</I><SUB>n</SUB>}</SPAN> each of whose elements is 0 or 1, such that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2172img1.png ALT="$ \sum_{{i}}^{}$">(<I>a</I><SUB>i</SUB>*<I>v</I><SUB>i</SUB>) = <I>T</I></SPAN>.<P>The idea behind Merkle-Hellman scheme is to encode a binary message as a solution to a knapsack problem reducing the ciphertext to the target sum obtained by adding terms corresponding to 1s in the plaintext.

<P>Generating random numbers is ususally done through a function of the form:<P><P></P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay"><I>seed</I> (<I>x</I> + 1) = [<I>seed</I> (<I>x</I>) + <I>STEP</I>]%<I>MOD</I></DIV><P></P><P>The numbers generated will be between 0 and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>MOD</I> - 1</SPAN>.

Note that by the nature of the function to generate the same <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>seed</I> (<I>x</I> + 1)</SPAN> every time <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>seed</I> (<I>x</I>)</SPAN> occurs means that if a function will generate all the numbers between 0 and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>MOD</I> - 1</SPAN>, it will generate pseudo-random numbers uniformly with every <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>MOD</I></SPAN> iterations.<P>If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>STEP</I> = 15</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>MOD</I> = 20</SPAN>, the function generates the series 0, 15, 10, 5 (or any other repeating series if the initial seed is other than 0).

<P>In the year 2199, the earth is united into a Federation with the head of the Federation being the Prime Minister. The newly elected Prime Minister <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN> decided to colonize Mars by constructing cities and interconnection pathways between cities. Acording to the geographical survey, the Federation has chosen a square piece of flat land to construct <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2179img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>N</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/2179img1.png ALT="$ \le$">10, 000</SPAN>, cities. Each city <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>h</I></SPAN> is given a coordinate <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>h</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>h</SUB>)</SPAN> at the 2-dimensional <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>xy</I></SPAN>-plane with the point of origin at the south-west corner of the piece of the land. Each city is in the shape of a circle with a radius of exactly 0.5 kilometer. The coordinate is the center of the city. It is known that the values of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> coordinates of any city are in units of 1 kilometer and are positive integers smaller or equal to 100,000. No two cities have the same coordinates. Since Mars has unpredictable weathers, Prime Minister <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN> decided to build covered pathways between the cities. In order to speed-up the construction, simplify the construction plan and save budget, only north-south or east-west bounded pathways connecting exactly two cities are constructed. The height and width of each pathway is exactly 3 meters. In addition, no two pathways intersect except at the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> cities. According to the above, Minister of Transportation <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> designs the following pathway constructing plan:<P><UL><LI>If a pathway is built between two cities, then the <SPAN CLASS="textit">distance</SPAN> of this pathway is the actual distance outside the two city limits. The two cities are called the two <SPAN CLASS="textit">endpoints</SPAN> of the pathway. For example, a pathway between a city at (1,1) and (4,1) is two kilometers long in distance. These 2 kilometers of the pathway is called the <SPAN CLASS="textit">body</SPAN> of this pathway. </LI><LI>A pathway is built between two cities <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>u</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>u</I></SPAN> is directly to the north, south, east or west of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> if there is no city between <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>u</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN>. </LI><LI>Because it is possible for a vahicle to travel in Mars surface for a short distance without any covered protection, the distance between the centers of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>u</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> must be strictly larger than 1 kilometer in order for the pathway to be built. </LI><LI>In order not to cause noise in the cities, if any part of the body of a pathway is less than or equal to 0.5 kilometer of <SPAN CLASS="textbf">any part</SPAN> (not the center) of a city that is not one of the two endpoints, then this pathway is not built. </LI><LI>If a potential east-west bounded pathway is intersected with a north-south bounded pathway, then the east-west bounded one is not built. </LI></UL><P>The construction plan is approved by Primary minister <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN>.

<P>A <SPAN CLASS="textit">deadlock</SPAN> is defined as a set of processes entering a state where each process is waiting for response (or computing resources) from other processes. For example, in OS text books, there are deadlock detection algorithms to detect if a set of processes is <SPAN CLASS="textit">deadlocked</SPAN> during runtime.<P>The deadlock detction problem here is to prevent deadlocks from happening before a program is executed (or even before the program is implemented). The problem is to find if there are <SPAN CLASS="textit">potential deadlocks</SPAN> among a set of processes without executing the program.<P>Assume that processes communicate via <SPAN CLASS="textit">send</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="textit">receive</SPAN> with buffer of zero lenght; that is, when a process invokes <SPAN CLASS="textit">send</SPAN>, it must block (or wait) until the message is received by the designated process via <SPAN CLASS="textit">receive</SPAN>. When a process invokes a <SPAN CLASS="textit">receive</SPAN> command and there is no message available, the process must block (or wait) until a message arrives. Note that it is possible for two processes to send to the same process <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> and then <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> receive the two in sequence. For example, there are three processes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I>1</SPAN>,<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I>2</SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I>3</SPAN> as follows:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"></DIV><PRE>

The <SPAN CLASS="textit">receive</SPAN> command, on the other hand, does not need to specify the process from wich the message is sent, so there is no process ID in the <SPAN CLASS="textit">receive</SPAN> command. The synchronization among the processes constitutes a synchronization structure. If there is no deadlock in a system, we say the system is well-synchronized.<P>Researchers discovered that we can abstract every process is abstracted into a finite-state machine which is expressed using a directed graph with labels on the vertices and edges.

Continuously, you can allways find two stones to move without any deadlock. We can verify that this example has no deadlocks states. Figure 2(a) is an example that has deadlocks. Suppose we initially put the stones as shown in Figure 2(a). Suppose we move the stone of G1 and G3 to become a state in (b). In (b), we can not make any further movements, thus is deadlocked.

<p>There are several ancient Greek texts that contain descriptions of the fabled island Atlantis. Some of
these texts even include maps of parts of the island. But unfortunately, these maps describe different regions
of Atlantis. Your friend Bill has to know the total area for which maps exist. You (unwisely) volunteered
to write a program that calculates this quantity.


<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

The input file consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing a single integer n
(1&le;n&le;100) of available maps. The n following lines describe one map each. Each of these lines contains
four numbers x1 ; y1 ; x2 ; y2 (0&le;x1&lt;x2&le;100000; 0&le;y1&lt;y2&le;100000), not necessarily integers. The
values (x1 ; y1) and (x2 ; y2) are the coordinates of the top-left resp. bottom-right corner of the mapped area.
The input file is terminated by a line containing a single 0. DonÂ’t process it.

For each test case, your program should output one section. The first line of each section must be "Test
case #k", where k is the number of the test case (starting with 1). The second one must be "Total
explored area: a", where a is the total explored area (i.e. the area of the union of all rectangles in
this test case), printed exact to two digits to the right of the decimal point.
Output a blank line after each test case.

Your little sister got a new mechanical building kit, which includes many cog-wheels of different sizes.
She started building gears with different ratios, but soon she noticed that there were some ratios which
were quite difficult to realize, and some others she couldnÂ’t realize at all. Since the most intelligent being
in your family is your computer (as you have always been claiming), now it has to figure out which ratios
are achievable.

<p>
There you are! ThatÂ’s the punishment for bragging about your computer. Now, you must write a
program that will do the job: your sister tells you the sizes of the cog-wheels (the numbers of cogs they
have) in her kit. Then, she tells you the ratios of the gears she would like to build. Your computer has to
decide whether this is possible and, if so, determine how to connect the wheels to obtain the ratio.

<p>
Here is an example: letÂ’s assume there are cog-wheels with 6, 12, and 30 cogs. Your sister wants to
realize a gear of ratio 4 : 5. One possible solution is the following:

<p align=center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2185a.gif>

<p>
The picture shows a complete gear of ratio 4 : 5. Four wheels are used: c<sub>1</sub> with 12 cogs, d<sub>1</sub> with 6 cogs,
c<sub>2</sub> with 12 cogs, and d<sub>2</sub> with 30 cogs. Note that d<sub>1</sub> and c<sub>2</sub> share one axis. In this configuration, if c<sub>1</sub> turns
once, d<sub>2</sub> will make 4/5 of a rotation.

<p>
On the other hand, no gear of ratio 1 : 6 can be realized using the cog-wheels your sister has.

<p>The picture above can be written as 12 : 6; 12 : 30. Each transmission is written as c : d,wherecand d
denote the number of cogs of the two wheels. A list of transitions c<sub>1</sub> : d<sub>1</sub> , c<sub>2</sub> : d<sub>2</sub> , ... , c<sub>m</sub>:d<sub>m</sub> means that the
second wheel of each transition is on the same axis as the first one of the next transition (d<sub>i</sub> and c<sub>i+1</sub> share
one axis for 1 $le; i < m). For those of you who are not good at mechanics: the ratio realized by this gear is

<p align=center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2185a.gif>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
<p>The input file contains the descriptions of several sets of cog-wheels, each one followed by a list of ratios
to be realized.

<p>A set of cog-wheels is described by one line starting with the number n of sizes of cog-wheels (1 &le;
n &le; 20). The rest of the line will consist of n numbers a<sub>1</sub>,...,a<sub>n</sub>, the numbers of cogs on the wheels. There
will always be at least 5 and at most 100 cogs per wheel. You may assume that your sister has an infinite
supply of wheels of each size.

<p>In your sisterÂ’s building kit (and thus, in the input file), the number of cogs on every wheel is divisible
by the number of cogs on the smallest wheel in the kit.

<p>The line describing the set of cog-wheels is followed by a list of ratios to be realized. Each ratio to
be realized is given by one line containing two numbers a<sub>j</sub> and b<sub>j</sub> (1 &le; aj , bj &le; 10000; a<sub>j</sub> != b<sub>j</sub> ), meaning
a<sub>j</sub> : b<sub>j</sub> . The line Â“0 0Â” marks the end of that list.

<p>At the end of the input file, there will be a line containing only a zero (instead of the number of cog-wheels
of the next set).


<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<p>Output one section for each set of cog-wheels. The sections should start with the line Â“Set #kÂ” where k
is the number of the set.

<p>Then, output the results for the ratios from the test set. Output exactly one line for each ratio. Each
of these lines should start with Â“Ratio a<sub>j</sub> :b<sub>j</sub> :Â”, followed either by Â“ImpossibleÂ” if the ratio cannot
be realized with the given set of cog-wheels, or a description of a gear which realizes the ratio. This
description has to be in the notation described above: a blank-separated list of transitions, each transition
having the form Â“c<sub>i</sub>:d<sub>i</sub>Â”.

<p>The gear does not need to be the smallest possible; we guarantee that if there is a solution then there is
a solution using at most 10000 transitions. Any solution with at most that many transitions is an acceptable
answer.

<p>Every section should be followed by a blank line.

It is easy to describe, the boss said: At the height of the fire season, the department maintains a database of fire fighter unit locations and the reported sightings of fire. The horizontal and vertical distance, of the closest grid point, from the left lower corner of the state is used to describe the location of a fire or a fire fighter unit. An experienced team of officers dispatches each of the units to one of the fires, with the objective that the longest time for a unit to reach a fire is minimized. At the end of a long day, members of the team are exhausted and their judgement may not be the best possible. The above example shows 4 fires (marked by the letter F) and 3 units (marked by the letter H) already deployed in the field.

<P>
Your task is to program a method for dispatching the fire fighter units to fire locations so that they arrive at their destinations in the shortest possible time.

Rob runs a one-man security firm. When he is not out on the street doing what PIs usually do, he makes his money watching videos on his broadband connected computer (Security video streams, that is). Being a very stressful job, even with its meager pay of no more than 200 dollars for a video stream, as he is required to raise the alarm immediately when a potential security breach occurs, he elected to impose the rule of not watching more than two video streams at any time. For each job Rob knows the starting time (given in minutes with ``0" as mid-night and all times belong to the same day), duration (in minutes) and payment (in dollars). 

<P>
Your task is to write a program to help Rob to select the videos he must watch to maximize his pay for a given day.

The local scoring system, which totally ignores the time of submission, is based on adding the values associated with the solved problems for each team and then declares the team, or teams, with the highest score as winner, or winners. The values associated with each problem are selected by the contest organizer and are made public in advance.<P>Our guru also scrambled the extracted information, by permuting the ``Team number" entries, and provided the permutation number as the clue for the organizer. He claims this is a good method to maintain privacy when number of submissions is small. For example, for the contest with four submissions, shown on the left side below, the ``Team number" entries have been permuted according to the 9th permutation of four items and shown on the right side.<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=2 BORDER FRAME=BOX RULES=GROUPS><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>3 2 765629 0</TT></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>17 2 765629 0</TT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>17 4 1120132 0</TT></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>3 4 1120132 0</TT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>3 2 1895629 3</TT> </TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>3 2 1895629 3</TT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>6 3 9024555 0</TT></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><TT>6 3 9024555 0</TT></TD></TR></TABLE></DIV><P><P><BR>You may recall that the number of permutations of ``<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>" items is ``<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I>!</SPAN>".

The three prominent mobile service providers of Wonderland are Coktel, Anglolink and Grinding Phone. All three operators provide very cheap rate packages after 12:00 AM. The name of their packages are Â“The Thief TalkÂ” (Â“Chorer AlapÂ” in Bangla), Â“InsomniaÂ” and Â“The Vampire ChatÂ” respectively. These cheap packages have inspired many people to disturb others at Night.</p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><img width=252 height=163 src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2189.gif align=left hspace=12>One such gone to ashtray guy is Arif whose activities begin after 12:00 AM. He dials a number randomly and writes down it in his notebook if he likes it. Later he dials those numbers written in his notebook frequently. As names are not important to him so his note book contains only numbers, and no names. But in a few days his notebook becomes filled with many numbers. So now he wants to reorganize the numbers in a new notebook. The reorganizing process is described below:</p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>ArifÂ’s notebook contains many numbers so there may exist some consecutive numbers. Therefore he wants to save space by writing the consecutive numbers as a range. For example if there are three numbers 01711322396, 01711322397, 01711322398 then he will write them as 01711322396-8. It means that the smallest number in the sequence is the first part of the range followed by a hyphen and then only the rightmost digits of the largest number that are different than the first number. A phone number can have any numerical value within 100 and 2000000000 (inclusive) and is always preceded by only a single zero. So 01123 is a valid phone number but 00123, 089, 1234, 02000000001 are invalid phone numbers.</p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>You will be given up to 100000 sorted phone (As you canÂ’t sort numbers) numbers and your job is to write a program that does the job for Arif.Â </p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p><h5 style='text-align:justify'><span class=StyleArial16pt><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Input</span></span></h5><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The input file contains 110 sets of inputs.

<P>Professor AlwaysLate is notorious for having something to say past the end of class time, and even past the start time of following classes. This habit is not viewed kindly by the students' rights movement, which motivated them to collect data about such conduct. The students' rights movement wants to process their extensive data collection and extract some useful information for their annual report, and you are asked to help. Your task is to write a program to read a number of lines, where each line contains a record about a single class, and calculate the average length of time spent past the end of class for Professor AlwaysLate.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of a series of scenarios.

They tend to do things by hand which can only be done with computers. Our friend Hashmat is such a person and now he is counting with abacus, pencil and paper the summation of trailing zeroes of a particular number in all possible number systems (Of course, I am talking about the common number system like decimal, binary, hexadecimal or n-based number system).</p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><img width=204 height=200 src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2195a.gif align=left hspace=12></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>We the average intelligent peoples know what a number system is. Our daily life number system is the decimal (10-based) number system, our corporate life number system is the binary (2-based) number system. A number may or may not have trailing zeroes in certain number system. For example in decimal number system 102<b>0</b><sub>10</sub> (It means 1020 is a number whose base is 10) has 1 trailing zero but in hexadecimal number system 102<b>0</b><sub>10 </sub>has no trailing zeroes. Let us create a function <i>fzero(n,b)</i>, which actually denotes the number of trailing zeroes of n in b-based number system. So fzero(102<b>0</b><sub>10</sub>,10)=1 and fzero(102<b>0</b><sub>10</sub>,16)=0. Although for a certain number and certain base the task is trivial but it is very time consuming to do it for all possible number systems with the help of only pencil and paper. So your job is now to help Hashmat, so that he can complete this task and do something meaningful in life. In other words given the value of n your job is to find out the value of:</p><p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><sub><img width=110 height=54 src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2195a.gif></sub></p><h5 style='text-align:justify'><span class=StyleArial16pt><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Input</span></span></h5><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The input file contains at most 400 lines of inputs.

Zonq is a lovely planet with plenty of natural resources and its inhabitants, the zonq-ians, developed into a peace-loving people, with high moral standards and a rich culture of arts, sciences and all things nice. Clunq, on the other hand, is a cold, dark planet where the resources are scarce, and its inhabitants, the clunq-ons, struggle for their existence from the day they are born. It is no wonder they developed into strong fighters, and martial arts are their main form of culture.</p><p style='text-align:justify'>As always happens in the universe, at some point in their development the clunq-ons invented space exploration, and now they are on the verge of loading their space-ships with warriors to conquer Zonq. Although the zonq-ians developed mathematics to a very high level (they factorize million digit numbers for breakfast and the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is taught in elementary school), they never bothered to tire themselves with such mundane things as computers and informatics. So now they need your help to defend the planet.</p><p style='text-align:justify'>Zonq consists of a number of villages connected by roads. Since the zonq-ians hate physical labour, they built just enough roads to insure that all villages are mutually connected, directly or indirectly, but not one road more. When the clunq-ons invade, they will always land on a road, halfway between two villages, and spread out from there. To defend the roads, the zonq-ians can place guard robots in their villages. There are two types: soldier-bots and sergeant-bots. A soldier-bot, when placed in a village, protects all roads connected to that village. A sergeant-bot is more powerful: it protects the roads connected to the village it is placed in, but also all roads connected to the villages that are direct neighbors to it. Both types of robot come at a price, and it's your task to assign robots to villages such that: a) all roads are protected, b) the total cost of the robots is as low as possible.</p><h5 style='text-align:justify'><span class=StyleArial16pt><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Input</span></span></h5><p style='text-align:justify'>There are several scenarios. Each scenario starts with three numbers on a line by it self: N (1 &#8804; N &#8804; 10000), the number of villages, C1 (0 &#8804; C1 &#8804; 1000), the cost of a soldier-bot, and C2 (0 &#8804; C2 &#8804; 1000), the cost of a sergeant-bot. For the sake of abstraction, the villages are numbered from 1 to N. Then follow N-1 lines containing two numbers V1 (1 &#8804; V1 &#8804; N) and V2 (1 &#8804; V2 &#8804; N)., each defining a road between two villages, numbered V1 and V2, respectively.

Â“Battle of the triangleÂ” has evolved as the most popular online game now. The game is played between two armies: One army is controlled by 100 players from one city and another army is controlled by another 100 player from another city.</p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>At the start of the game there is a toss. The winner of the toss is marked Team A and the loser is marked team B. The battle field is already generated for the two teams. Battle field means a two dimensional plane where positions of the soldiers are given by two dimensional Cartesian Coordinate System and position of the tanks are also given by two dimensional Cartesian Coordinate System. There are three boundary lines which create a triangle and everything inside the triangle belongs to Team A and everything in the reciprocal regions of the triangle belongs to team B, as shown in the picture below. The other three regions are neutral regions. Team A can move the boundary lines to select his own triangle. But of course he cannot rotate the boundary lines.</p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p><div align=right><table class=MsoTableGrid border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 align=right style='border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:6.75pt;margin-right:6.75pt'><tr><td width=369 valign=top style='width:276.7pt;padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt'><p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'><img width=370 height=280 src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2199a.gif></p></td></tr><tr><td width=369 valign=top style='width:276.7pt;padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt'><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

Each team has a Captain. The captain of Team A initially selects the three boundary lines. When the boundary lines are selected the server has to give the Captain of Team A two information: The difference between soldier number of Team A and Team B and the difference between the tank number of Team A and Team B so that the captain can rethink his strategy.Â  But as many teams all around the world play at the same time using the same battle field so the server has to answer many queries simultaneously. Your job is to write a program that does this job very efficiently.</p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Â </p><h5><span class=StyleArial16pt><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Input</span></span></h5><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The input file contains several sets of inputs. The description of each set is given below:</p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Each set starts with three integers S, T and Q. Here S (0&lt;S&#8804;50000) is the total number of soldiers in the map, T (0&lt;T&#8804;50000) is the total number of Tanks in the map and Q (0&lt;Q&#8804;10000) is the total number of queries the server has to handle. Each of the next S lines contain two integers x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>iÂ  </sub>(|x<sub>i</sub>|, |y<sub>i</sub>|&#8804;10000000) which denotes the Cartesian coordinates of the soldiers. Each of the next T lines contains two integers x<sub>j</sub>, y<sub>jÂ  </sub>(|x<sub>j</sub>|, |y<sub>j</sub>|&#8804;10000000) which denotes the coordinates of the tanks. These lines are followed by 3Q lines as each query consists of three lines of inputs. First line contains three integers<sub><img width=64 height=23 src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2199a.gif></sub>, second line contains three integers <sub><img width=69 height=23 src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2199a.gif></sub>Â and third line contains three integers<sub><img width=71 height=24 src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2199a.gif></sub>. These denotes that captain of team A has placed the first boundary line along the straight line <sub><img width=127 height=23 src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2199a.gif></sub>Â the second boundary line along the straight line along the straight line <sub><img width=128 height=23 src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2199a.gif></sub>Â and the third boundary line along the straight line <sub><img width=127 height=24 src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2199a.gif></sub>. So the region for team A is the triangle formed by these three straight lines and the region for team B is three reciprocal regions of this triangle. For each query you have to find the soldier number difference between team A and B and tank number difference between team A and team B. The figure below corresponds to the sample input. You can of course assume that in a set of input the first line of each query are parallel to one another, and this is true for second lines of each query and third line of each query as well.Â  You can also assume that (<sub><img width=181 height=23 src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2199a.gif></sub>), <sub><img width=155 height=23 src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/21/p2199a.gif></sub>, no two lines in a query are parallel each other, the three lines in a query are not concurrent and no soldier and no tank will be on any of the three boundary lines.</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>Input is terminated by a case where S=T=Q=0. This case should not be processed. The input file size is around 6 MB. This will give you some idea on how efficient your program needs to be.</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><h4><span class=StyleArial16pt><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Output </span></span></h4><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>For each set of input produce (Q+1) lines of outputs. First line contains the battle field serial. Each of the next Q lines contains output for one query. For each query output in a single line the serial of the query followed by two integers DS and DT separated by a single space. Here DS is the difference of number of soldiers between team A and team B, and DT is the difference of number of tanks between team A and team B. Look at output for sample input for details. Although this problem does not have multiple answers, due to unstable behavior of floating-point number is linux a difference of one between judge solution and contestant solution will be accepted.

<P>
It's Friday evening and Jill hates two things
which are common to all trains:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>They are always late.
</LI>
<LI>The schedule is always wrong.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Nevertheless, tomorrow in the early morning hours Jill will have to
travel from Hamburg to Darmstadt in order to get to the regional
programming contest.
Since she is afraid of arriving too late and being excluded from the contest
she is looking for the train which gets her to Darmstadt as early
as possible.
However, she dislikes to get to the station too early, so if there
are several schedules with the same arrival time then she will choose the
one with the latest departure time.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Jill asks you to help her with her problem.
You are given a set of railroad schedules from which you must compute
the train with the earliest arrival time and the fastest connection from one
location to another.
One good thing: Jill is very experienced in changing trains. She can do this
instantaneously, i.e., in zero time!!!

<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1 &lt; <I>C</I>
 &le; 100</SPAN>, followed by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> lines
containing city names. These names consist of letters.

Part two describes all the trains running during a day.
It starts with a number <!-- MATH
 $T \le 1000$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I>
 &le; 1000</SPAN> followed by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> train descriptions.
Each of them consists of one line with a number <!-- MATH

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I><SUB>i</SUB>
 &le; 100</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>
more lines
with a time and a city name, meaning that passengers can get on or off the
train at that time at that city.

<P>
Part three consists of three lines: Line one contains the earliest journey's
starting time, line two the name of the city where she starts,
and line three the destination city. The two cities are always different.

<P>
If a connection exists then print the two lines

While skimming his phone directory in 1982, Albert Wilansky, a mathematician
of Lehigh University, noticed that the telephone number of
his brother-in-law H.&nbsp;Smith had the following peculiar property: The sum of the
digits of that number was equal to the sum of the digits of the prime factors
of that number. Got it? Smith's telephone number was 493-7775. This number can
be written as the product of its prime factors in the following way:
 <!-- MATH
 \begin{displaymath}
4937775 = 3\cdot 5\cdot 5\cdot 65837
\end{displaymath}
 -->
<P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay">
4937775 = 3<SUP> . </SUP>5<SUP> . </SUP>5<SUP> . </SUP>65837
</DIV><P></P>
 The sum of all digits of the telephone number is
<!-- MATH
 $4+9+3+7+7+7+5=42$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">4 + 9 + 3 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 5 = 42</SPAN>, and the sum of the digits of its prime factors is equally
<!-- MATH
 $3+5+5+6+5+8+3+7=42$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">3 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 8 + 3 + 7 = 42</SPAN>. Wilansky was so amazed by his discovery that he named
this type of numbers after his brother-in-law: Smith numbers.

<P>
As this observation is also true for every prime number, Wilansky
decided later that a (simple and unsophisticated) prime number is
not worth being a Smith number and he excluded them from the definition.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Wilansky published an article about Smith numbers in the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Two Year
  College Mathematics Journal</SPAN> and was able to present a whole collection of
different Smith numbers: For example, 9985 is a Smith number and so is 6036.
However, Wilansky was not able to give a Smith number which was larger
than the telephone number of his brother-in-law. It is your task to find
Smith numbers which are larger than 4937775.

<P>In the Ancient Caves of Mystery (ACM), scientists have found another old computer. Surprisingly it still worked. The scientists started typing text at the keyboard which was shown immediately on the computer screen. But every now and again some characters were inserted - apparently out of nowhere. After a while they noticed that only characters were inserted which they had typed before. Andrew C. Matthiews, a young and very ambitious theoretician, conjectured that the computer was connected to an interstellar computer network and the inserted characters were in fact an echo generated by some mysterious alien <EM>Echo Race</EM>.

<P>Fold-up patterns for solids like cubes or octahedrons can be found in many books, but without actually folding them it is hard to tell whether they will really work. We will restrict our attention to a special class of patterns.<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/22/p2207a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p2207a.eps}"></DIV><P><P><BR>Given a fold-up pattern built from unit squares in the plane, together with a description along what edges it should be folded in what direction, decide whether it will result in a closed surface of a solid in three dimensions. If it does, find the volume of the solid.<P>More precisely, the pattern consists of a connected set of unit squares in the plane. For any edge between connected sides you are told whether to fold forward, back, or not at all along that edge, always at right angles. If an edge of two adjacent squares in the pattern is not mentioned in the input, you may assume that the squares are not connected and can be ripped apart when folding. However, connected edges must always be folded according to the description.<P>For our purposes a closed surface is one so that every square in the pattern separates the inside from the outside. When folded, the squares of the pattern lie on a rectangular, 3-dimensional grid, and each separates a cell (cubes of side length one unit) on the inside from one on the outside. For every cell it must be clear whether it is inside or outside. The following sketch illustrates this rule in two dimensions (the ``insides'' are shaded).<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/22/p2207a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p2207b.eps}"></DIV><P>Note that according to our definition the second pattern in the sketch at the top of the page is a closed surface, although it rather looks like two separate cubes attached along an edge.<P>Two different squares must not occupy exactly the same position in space, though they may (and should for a closed surface) touch at edges and vertices. Make sure that the pattern does not interpenetrate itself through connected edges. Apart from that, do not worry about the process of folding, e.g. what edges are folded first or whether part of the structure is in the way for the rest.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The first line of the input specifies the number of scenarios.<P>For each scenario, the first line provides the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1 <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/22/p2207a.gif ALT="$ \leq$"> <I>n</I> <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/22/p2207a.gif ALT="$ \leq$"> 1000</SPAN> of squares in the pattern and the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH">0 <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/22/p2207a.gif ALT="$ \leq$"> <I>e</I> <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/22/p2207a.gif ALT="$ \leq$"> 4000</SPAN> of edges.

<P>
Should athletes be required to undergo drug testing? And if drug testing is required, should an
athlete who tests positive be banned from sport?  These questions are haunting the Seoul
Olympics Drug Free Association (SODFA) for the past few months.  Several sources of
uncertainty, as well as several ``costs" are involved here.

<P>
The uncertainties involve the proportion of the total athlete population who use drugs and the
reliability of the tests.  If an athlete is tested for a certain type of drug usage (steroids, say), then
the test will come out either positive or negative.  However, these tests are never perfect.  Some
athletes who are drug-free tested positive, and some who are drug users tested negative. The
former is called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">false positives</SPAN>, and the latter are called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">false negatives</SPAN>.  
For example, in the last Sydney
Olympics, SODFA found out that 5% of all athletes use drugs, 3% of all tests on drug-free
athletes yield false positives, and 7% of all tests on drug users yield false negatives.

<P>
There are certain ``monetary" values involved with drug testing.  These values can be broadly
categorized into benefits and costs.  The benefit for drug testing is correctly identifying a drug
user and banning him or her from sports.  The costs includes the obvious cost of the tests, but
also the less obvious ``costs" of invading an athlete's privacy and of declaring an athlete a drug
user when in fact he or she is not (because of faulty test).  Specifically, for this problem the
monetary values involved are as follows:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The benefit B from correctly identifying a drug user and barring him or her from sports.
</LI>
<LI>The cost C1 of the test itself for a single athlete (materials and labor).
</LI>
<LI>The cost C2 of falsely accusing a non-user and barring him or her from sports.
</LI>
<LI>The cost C3 of not identifying a drug user (either by not testing at all or by obtaining a false negative).
</LI>
<LI>The cost C4 of violating a nonuser's privacy by performing the test.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Observe that only C1 is a direct monetary cost that is easy to measure.  However, the other
``costs" and benefit B are real, and they must be compared on the same scale to enable
administrators to make a rational decision. In this problem you must do so by comparing
everything to the cost C1.  (We would express all other costs as multiples of C1.)

<P>
You may assume that there are only two alternatives: perform drug testing on all athletes or do not
perform any drug testing.  In the former case, the result of the drug test is first observed.  Each
test result leads to an action (ban or no ban from sports), and then the eventual benefit or cost
depends on whether the athlete uses drugs.  If no drug testing is performed, then there is no
intermediate test result.  You may also assume that all benefits have a positive sign and all costs
have a negative sign associated with them.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
SODFA needs your help to write a program that computes:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The probability that an athlete who tested positive is a drug user.
</LI>
<LI>The probability that an athlete who tested negative is drug-free.
</LI>
<LI>The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Potential Monetary Value</SPAN> for performing drug testing (denoted by  <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>PMV</I><SUB>T</SUB></SPAN>). It is defined as:  <!-- MATH

The weighted cost of a positive or negative drug test result is a weighted average of the total monetary values associated with the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">eventual</SPAN> outcomes of the drug test result, weighted by their probabilities.  Note that an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">eventual</SPAN> outcome of a positive drug test may yield a false positive.  Similarly, an eventual outcome of a negative drug test may yield a false negative. Formally, if  <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> is the total monetary value corresponding to eventual outcome <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> is its probability, then <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I></SPAN> is defined as follows:

<P>In a manufacturing simulation, a <SPAN CLASS="textit">process route</SPAN> specifies the sequence of various processing steps required to transform raw materials into finished products. Processing steps are arranged in the order in which they occur in the manufacturing of the product. Each processing step is represented by a record that contains information for that step. The record includes the <SPAN CLASS="textit">machine</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="textit">operators</SPAN> required for the step and the <SPAN CLASS="textit">processing time</SPAN>. For example, test case 1 in the sample input specifies a process route with five processing steps. Machine <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I>1</SPAN> and operator <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>O</I>1</SPAN> are used in the first step which requires a processing time of 0.1 time unit. Exactly one machine is used per processing step. However, zero, one or multiple operators may be required in a given processing step.<P>It is possible for two different machines to require the same operator to perform the operation (e.g., both processing steps 1 and 3 in test case 1 require operator <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>O</I>1</SPAN> and both processing steps 3 and 4 require operator <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>O</I>2</SPAN>). In addition, different operators may be required to operate the machine in a given processing step (e.g., processing steps 3 in test case 1 uses both <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>O</I>1</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>O</I>2</SPAN>). This leads to situations as shown in the following figure, where machine <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I>1</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I>2</SPAN> share operator <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>O</I>1</SPAN>, and machine <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I>2</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I>3</SPAN> share operator <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>O</I>2</SPAN>.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="631" HEIGHT="246" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/22/p2213.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p2213.eps}"></DIV><P>Machines and operators are modeled as resources in simulation. The relationship between machines and operators can be defined as follows: machine <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> and operator <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> are related to each other (written as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I> <IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/22/p2213.gif ALT="$ \leftrightarrow$"> <I>Y</I></SPAN>) if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> are required in the same processing step.

<P>Mr. John Chong is a project manager in NewAge.com Pte Ltd. His task is to schedule activities in a project to make sure that the project can be completed in a minimum amount of time. An <SPAN CLASS="textit">activity</SPAN> is a part of the project that takes place over a period of time and a <SPAN CLASS="textit">milestone</SPAN> is the completion of an activity (or a group of activities). Activities in a project are usually specified using an <SPAN CLASS="textit">activity graph</SPAN> as shown below. Nodes in the activity graph are milestones and links are activities. The label of a link indicates the duration of the corresponding activity (in the unit of days). An activity can be specified using a <SPAN CLASS="textit">starting</SPAN> and an <SPAN CLASS="textit">ending milestone</SPAN>. For example, activity <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>BD</I></SPAN> takes 4 days to complete. It starts from milestone <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> and ends at milestone <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I></SPAN>. Each activity graph has exactly one <SPAN CLASS="textit">start</SPAN> and one <SPAN CLASS="textit">finish milestone</SPAN>. In the following diagram, the start milestone is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> and the finish milestone is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN>.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="551" HEIGHT="246" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/22/p2214.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p2214.eps}"></DIV><P>An activity graph also depicts the dependencies among activities and milestones. An activity starting from a milestone can only begin after all activities ending at that milestone have been completed. For instance, activity <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>DE</I></SPAN> can only begin after activities <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>BD</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>CD</I></SPAN> have been completed.<P>Given an activity graph, the minimum amount of time it will take to complete the project can be easily calculated. This is referred to as the <SPAN CLASS="textit">minimum duration</SPAN> of the project. The minimum duration of the project depicted by the above activity graph is 9 days. It is determined by the activities <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>AB</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>BD</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>DE</I></SPAN>. However, besides minimum duration, John also needs to know:<P><OL><LI>the earliest time an activity may begin (referred to as <SPAN CLASS="textit">earliest starting time</SPAN>, EST, of an activity), and </LI><LI>the latest time an activity may begin so that the project may still be completed in minimum duration (referred to as <SPAN CLASS="textit">latest starting time</SPAN>, LST, of an activity). </LI></OL><P>For example, in the above activity graph, activities <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>AB</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>AC</I></SPAN> can begin immediately since they do not depend on any other activities. So, their EST is 1 (i.e., day 1). Activity <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>BD</I></SPAN> can only begin after activity <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>AB</I></SPAN> has been completed. Its EST, therefore, is 4. Similarly, the EST of activity <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>CD</I></SPAN> is 3.

<P>An expert system consists of two main components. The <SPAN CLASS="textit">knowledge base</SPAN> contains the knowledge with which the <SPAN CLASS="textit">inference engine</SPAN> draws conclusion. In this problem, you will build a very small expert system. Each <SPAN CLASS="textit">knowledge</SPAN> (or <SPAN CLASS="textit">fact</SPAN>) is represented by a certain predicate name along with two arguments. Some possible facts are shown below:<P><PRE><TT>
<TT>father_of (tom,john).</TT> 		                              (1) 
<BR><TT>mother_of (mary,john).</TT> 		                           (2) 
<BR><TT>child_of (susan,mary).</TT> 		                              (3)
</TT></PRE><P><P><BR>The first fact states that Tom is the father of John. The second fact states that Mary is the mother of John, and the third fact states that Susan is a child of Mary. Each rule in the inference engine is represented in the following format:<P><P><BR><TT>p :- q.</TT><P><P><BR>where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> is the rule's <SPAN CLASS="textit">head</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I></SPAN> is the <SPAN CLASS="textit">subgoal</SPAN>. This expression states that the head goal <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> is satisfied if the subgoal <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I></SPAN> is satisfied. As an example, the `` <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>parent</I><IMG WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/22/2215img1.png ALT="$ \_of$"></SPAN>" rules are as follows:<P><P><BR><PRE><TT>

<BR><TT>parent_of (X,Y) :- mother_of (X,Y).</TT> 		           (5) 
<BR><TT>parent_of (X,Y) :- child_of (Y,X).</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&nbsp;</SPAN> (6)
</TT></PRE><P><P><BR>The rules state that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> is the parent of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> is the father of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> is the mother of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>, or <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> is a child of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN>. Note that the name of the head might be the same as the name of the subgoal.<P>There are two types of queries that a user may raise in this system. The first type of queries is similar to the statement of a fact, except that one argument is a <SPAN CLASS="textit">variable</SPAN> (that is, the unknown argument), and it begins with an uppercase letter. The system will need to use the facts it has to compute all the possible values of the variable. For example, the following query asks who is John's parent:<P><P><BR><TT>parent_of (X,john).</TT><P><P><BR>The system yields the following answers based on facts (2) and (1):<P><PRE>
X = mary
X = tom
</PRE><P>Note that there might be one or several values associated with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN>. If no proper value is found, there will be no output. The second type of queries looks like a rule with an empty head, which might yield an output of <TT>TRUE</TT> or <TT>FALSE</TT>. An example is as follows:<P><P><BR><TT>:- parent_of (tom,john).</TT><P><P><BR>This query asks if Tom is the parent of John. In this case, the system yields the following answer based on fact (1) and rule (4):<P><P><BR><TT>TRUE</TT><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input file consists of facts, rules, and queries.

<P>Flip game is played on a rectangular 4x4 field with two-sided pieces placed 
on each of its 16 squares. One side of each piece is white and the other one is 
black and each piece is lying either it's black or white side up. Each round you 
flip 3 to 5 pieces, thus changing the color of their upper side from black to 
white and vice versa. The pieces to be flipped are chosen every round according 
to the following rules:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Choose any one of the 16 pieces. 
  <LI>Flip the chosen piece and also all adjacent pieces to the left, to the 
  right, to the top, and to the bottom of the chosen piece (if there are any). 
  </LI></OL>
<P><IMG style="FLOAT: right" alt="Sample position"

example:</P><PRE><TT>bwbw
wwww
bbwb
bwwb</TT></PRE>
<P>Here "b" denotes pieces lying their black side up and "w" denotes pieces 
lying their white side up. If we choose to flip the 1st piece from the 3rd row 
(this choice is shown at the picture), then the field will become:</P><PRE><TT>bwbw
bwww
wwwb
wwwb</TT></PRE>
<P>The goal of the game is to flip either all pieces white side up or all pieces 
black side up. You are to write a program that will search for the minimum 
number of rounds needed to achieve this goal.</P>

<P>DBMS (Data Base Management System) development team has been successful in 
designing efficient Lock Manager and is going to proceed further. As a part of 
the team you will be responsible for the <STRONG>Buffer Manager</STRONG>.</P>
<P><STRONG>Data blocks</STRONG> being read by DBMS from the hard drive are 
stored in the main memory in a fixed number of pre-allocated 
<STRONG>buffers</STRONG>. Each buffer can hold one data block. Each buffer can 
be either <STRONG>free</STRONG> (does not contain any useful information) or 
<STRONG>occupied</STRONG> by some data. When DBMS is going to read data block 
from the hard drive it has to decide which buffer to use for data storing. If 
there are any free buffers, then one of them is used for that purpose. If there 
are no free buffers, then one of the occupied buffers has to be flushed to 
become free, unless it was <STRONG>locked</STRONG> by some part of DBMS.</P>
<P>The choice of the buffer to flush is critical to DBMS performance. A lot of 
different algorithms were developed, LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm being 
the one used most often. However, your DBMS is going to implement the Advanced 
Buffer Management algorithm which takes advantage of the fact that maximal 
performance is achieved when a number of consecutive data blocks from the hard 
drive are read into consecutive memory buffers. </P>
<P>Buffers are numbered from 1 to <EM>N</EM>, where <EM>N</EM> 
(1&nbsp;&#8804;&nbsp;<EM>N</EM>&nbsp;&#8804;&nbsp;100000) is a total number of buffers. Each 
buffer can be in any one of the following states: free, occupied or locked. Each 
occupied buffer is assigned an integer number from 1 to 9 Â– the 
<STRONG>worthiness</STRONG> of the currently stored information in that buffer. 
The worthiness of free buffers is considered to be zero. Locked buffers cannot 
be neither used nor flushed and their worthiness is undefined.</P>
<P>Having received the request to read <EM>K</EM> 
(1&nbsp;&#8804;&nbsp;<EM>K</EM>&nbsp;&#8804;&nbsp;10000) data blocks from the hard drive, 
Buffer Manager has to choose <EM>K</EM> consecutive non-locked buffers numbered 
from <EM>L</EM> to <EM>L</EM>+<EM>K</EM>-1 that have minimal possible sum of 
their worthiness, or to report that it is impossible to find <EM>K</EM> 
consecutive non-locked buffers. The latter can also happen if total number of 
buffers is less than <EM>K</EM>. </P>
<P>Your task is to write a program that models the processing of one request to 
Buffer Manager using the above algorithm.</P>

<blockquote><EM><STRONG>Dominoes</STRONG><BR><BR>game played with small, 
      rectangular blocks of wood or other material, each identified by a number 
      of dots, or pips, on its face. The blocks usually are called bones, 
      dominoes, or pieces and sometimes men, stones, or even cards.<BR><BR>The 
      face of each piece is divided, by a line or ridge, into two squares, each 
      of which is marked as would be a pair of dice...<BR><BR>The principle in 
      nearly all modern dominoes games is to match one end of a piece to another 
      that is identically or reciprocally numbered.</EM> 

<blockquote>ENCYCLOPÃ†DIA BRITANNICA
</blockquote></blockquote>


<P>Consider an arbitrary set of domino pieces where each 
piece is marked with two digits from 1 to 6. Some sets can be completely laid 
out in a row matching one end of a piece to another that is identically 
numbered, while others cannot. For example, the set consisting of 5 pieces: 
(1,&nbsp;5), (1,&nbsp;6), (5,&nbsp;5) and (2,&nbsp;4) twice, cannot be laid out 
in a row. However, if we add (2,&nbsp;5) piece to the above set we could lay out 
the resulting set in the following row:</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><IMG alt="(6, 1)(1, 5)(5, 5)(5, 2)(2, 4)(4, 2)" 
src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/22/p2219a.gif></IMG></P>
<P>However, we are interested in a row having the smallest sum of digits on its 
pieces. In our example, instead of the piece (2,&nbsp;5) with a sum of 7, we 
could add two pieces (1,&nbsp;2) with a total sum of 6 to lay out the following 
row:</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><IMG 
alt="(5, 5)(5, 1)(1, 2)(2, 4)(4, 2)(2, 1)(1, 6)" 
src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/22/p2219a.gif></IMG></P>
<P>Your task is to write a program that for a given domino set will find an 
additional (possibly empty) set with the smallest possible sum of digits, so 
that a row could be laid out with both sets combined.</P>

(2&nbsp;&#8804;&nbsp;<EM>N</EM>&nbsp;&#8804;&nbsp;100) representing the total number of 
pieces in the domino set. The following <EM>N</EM> lines describe pieces. Each

separated by a space. The digits of a piece can be written in any order.</P>

<P>Lilliputian frontier is a convex polygon with non-zero area. The vertices of 
this polygon are guard towers, which are connected by straight lines. This 
frontier is too long and expensive for Lilliputia to maintain; therefore the 
Lilliputian government has decided to revise it to make it shorter. However, 
they don't want to build new guard towers, but to use existing ones as a part of 
a new frontier.</P>
<P><IMG style="FLOAT: right" alt="Sample frontier picture" 
src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/22/p2221a.gif></IMG> Each day frontier guards inspect the 
frontier. They go from one guard tower to the next one, traversing the frontier 
clockwise. Guard towers are numbered from 1 to <EM>N</EM> according to this 
inspection order. Frontier revision should not change this way of inspection and 
the area of Lilliputia shall remain non-zero.</P>
<P>For example, the frontier that is shown on the picture (axes are in kilometer 
scale) is traversed by 
1&nbsp;-&nbsp;2&nbsp;-&nbsp;3&nbsp;-&nbsp;4&nbsp;-&nbsp;5&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 route, 
which is 57.89 kilometers long. To make the frontier as short as possible 
Lilliputia should revise it so that the frontier is traversed by 
2&nbsp;-&nbsp;3&nbsp;-&nbsp;4&nbsp;-&nbsp;2 route, thus reducing its length to 
27.31 kilometers.</P>
<P>However, Lilliputia has a number of historical monuments which are its major 
pride. The historical monuments shall be kept inside Lilliputia at any cost and 
they should not end up on the frontier. So, the task is to design the shortest 
frontier that will preserve all historical monuments inside Lilliputia.</P>
<P>On the sample picture two historical monuments marked "A" and "B" are shown. 
The desire to keep them inside Lilliputia will lead to the shortest frontier 
with a traverse path 1&nbsp;-&nbsp;2&nbsp;-&nbsp;3&nbsp;-&nbsp;4&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 
having 51.78 kilometers in length.</P>

<P>Hacker Bill has accidentally lost all the information from his workstation's 
hard drive and he has no backup copies of its contents. He does not regret for 
the loss of the files themselves, but for the very nice and convenient directory 
structure that he had created and cherished during years of work. Fortunately, 
Bill has several copies of directory listings from his hard drive. Using those 
listings he was able to recover full paths (like 
"WINNT\SYSTEM32\CERTSRV\CERTCO~1\X86") for some directories. He put all of them

<P>A cooperative society has purchased some land for distribution amongst its members. The land is divided into plots so that every member can get a plot. It is planned to mark each plot by a two meter high boundary wall. The boundary of each plot is shaped like a polygon (not necessarily a convex one). (The figure below shows a land with five plots.) It is divided into line segments such that any two line segments either intersect at an end point or do not intersect at all (there may be co-linear segments present). A builder has been hired to construct the boundary walls. He has put different groups of workers to work on different segments of the boundary wall (a segment of boundary wall corresponds to a line segment in the boundary of a plot).

<P>One day, looking at old documents inherited from his grandfather, Ramesh discovers a map. Reading the accompanying document, he realizes that the map is of a complex maze of chambers and passages inside a mountain. Chambers in this maze have doors opening to passages leading to other chambers. All the doors have one peculiarity: they have handles only on one side, and so can be opened either from the chamber or from the passage but not both. The passages leading from any chamber have been designed in such a way that either there is only one passage leading out or there is a passage such that upon following it one can <SPAN CLASS="textit">never come back</SPAN> to the chamber. Also, there is at most one passage between any two chambers. On the ceiling of each chamber, a number is written. There are two special chambers: the entry chamber and the exit chamber.

Company  ACIDIC  manufactures  acid.  The  acid  is  filled  into  containers  and  sent  out  to  different  places.  Sometimes,  the containers start leaking. To handle such situations, the company has a room with several container holders. These holders are arranged in a rectangle grid. Each of these can hold one leaky container and absorb the acid leakage. After all the acid has leaked out, the containers are taken out and the leak point(s) are fixed. One day, the leaky containers were put in some of the holders. After a while, some more leaky containers were detected and brought to the room. The supervisor handling this then realized that all the containers that are present in the room are leaking very heavily. So heavily that they have corroded their holders and in a short time they would also corrode all the holders in the room in the directions of the leak. The containers are leaking either in the North-South direction or in the East-West direction. (The figure above shows a room with a 4-by-6 grid of holders having four leaky containers. The  dashed arrows represent the direction of leakage.) The supervisor tried to remove containers from their holders but could not as they were stuck to the holders. However, he could rotate the containers so that the direction of leakage could be changed from North-South to East-West or vice-versa. The supervisor suspects that the current lot of leaky containers may also start to leak heavily. Help the supervisor find the rotations of existing containers and  placement of current lot of containers so that the number of corroded holders is minimized.

ACM Airlines is a regional airline with von Neumann Airport as its home port. For many passengers, von Neumann
Airport is not the start of their trip, nor their final destination, so many transfer passengers pass through the airport.

<p>
The von Neumann Airport has a corridor layout. Arrival gates are located, equally spaced, at the north side of the
corridor. Departure gates are at the south side of the corridor, equally spaced as well. The distance between two
adjacent gates equals the width of the corridor. Each arrival gate is assigned to exactly one city, and the same holds
for the departure gates. Passengers arrive at the arrival gate assigned to their city of origin and exit the terminal or
proceed to a connecting flight at a gate assigned to their destination city. For this problem, only passengers with
connecting flights are considered.

<p>
Transferring passengers generate a lot of traffic in the corridor. The average number of people traveling between
cities is known beforehand. Using this information, it should be possible to reduce the traffic. If transfers from city
Cx to city Cy occur very frequently, it may help to locate the gates assigned to these cities near or even directly
opposite each other.

<p>
Due to the presence of shops and gardens it is not possible to cross the corridor diagonally, so the distance between
arriving gate G1 and departing gate G3 (see diagram) equals 1 + 2 = 3.


<p>
You must assess total traffic load for several different configurations. The traffic load between an origin and
destination gate is defined as the number of origin to destination passengers multiplied by the distance between the
arriving and departing gate. The total traffic load is the sum of the traffic loads for all origin-destination pairs.

</H2>
The input file contains several test cases. The last test case in the input file is followed by a line containing the
number 0.

<p>
Each test case has two parts: first the traffic data, then the configuration section.

<p>
The traffic data starts with an integer <i>N (1 &le; N &le; 25)</i>, representing the number of cities. The following <i>N</i> lines each
represent traffic data for one city. Each line with traffic data begins with an integer in the range <i>1..N</i> identifying the
city of origin. This is followed by <i>k</i> pairs of integers, one pair for every destination city. Each pair identifies the
destination city and the number of passengers (at most 500) traveling from the city of origin to this destination city.

<p>
The configuration section consists of one or more (at most 20) configurations and ends with a line containing the
number 0.

<p>
A configuration consists of 3 lines. The first line contains a positive number identifying the configuration. The next
line contains a permutation of the cities, as they are assigned to the arrival gates: the first number represents the city
assigned to the first gate, and so on. The next line in the same way represents the cities as they are assigned to the
departure gates.

<P>
Once upon a time, in a giant piece of cheese, there lived a cheese mite named Amelia Cheese Mite. Amelia should
have been truly happy because she was surrounded by more delicious cheese than she could ever eat. Nevertheless,
she felt that something was missing from her life.

<p>
One morning, her dreams about cheese were interrupted by a noise she had never heard before. But she immediately
realized what it was Â— the sound of a male cheese mite, gnawing in the same piece of cheese! (Determining the
gender of a cheese mite just by the sound of its gnawing is by no means easy, but all cheese mites can do it. ThatÂ’s
because their parents could.)

<p>
Nothing could stop Amelia now. She had to meet that other mite as soon as possible. Therefore she had to find the
fastest way to get to the other mite. Amelia can gnaw through one millimeter of cheese in ten seconds. But it turns
out that the direct way to the other mite might not be the fastest one. The cheese that Amelia lives in is full of holes.
These holes, which are bubbles of air trapped in the cheese, are spherical for the most part. But occasionally these
spherical holes overlap, creating compound holes of all kinds of shapes. Passing through a hole in the cheese takes
Amelia essentially zero time, since she can fly from one end to the other instantly. So it might be useful to travel
through holes to get to the other mite quickly.

<p>
For this problem, you have to write a program that, given the locations of both mites and the holes in the cheese,
determines the minimal time it takes Amelia to reach the other mite. For the purposes of this problem, you can
assume that the cheese is infinitely large. This is because the cheese is so large that it never pays for Amelia to leave
the cheese to reach the other mite (especially since cheese-mite eaters might eat her). You can also assume that the
other mite is eagerly anticipating AmeliaÂ’s arrival and will not move while Amelia is underway.<P>

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input file contains descriptions of several cheese mite test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing a
single integer <i>n (0 &le; n &le; 100)</i>, the number of holes in the cheese. This is followed by <i>n</i> lines containing four integers
<i>x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, z<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub></i> each. These describe the centers (<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>y<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>z<sub>i</sub></i>) and radii <i>r<sub>i</sub></i> (<i>r<sub>i</sub> > 0</i>) of the holes. All values here (and in the
following) are given in millimeters.

<p>
The description concludes with two lines containing three integers each. The first line contains the values <i>x<sub>A</sub>, y<sub>A</sub>, z<sub>A</sub>,</i>
giving AmeliaÂ’s position in the cheese, the second line containing <i>x<sub>O</sub>, y<sub>O</sub>, z<sub>O</sub>,</i> gives the position of the other mite.

<p>
The input file is terminated by a line containing the number <i>Â–1</i>.

Your brilliant but absent-minded uncle believes he has solved a difficult crossword puzzle but has misplaced the
solution. He needs your help to reconstruct the solution from a list that contains all the words in the solution, plus
one extra word that is not part of the solution. Your program must solve the puzzle and print the extra word.

<p>
The crossword puzzle is represented by a grid with ten squares on each side. Figure 1 shows the top left corner of a
puzzle. The puzzle has a certain number of Â“slotsÂ” where a word can be placed. Each slot is represented by the row
and column number of the square where the slot begins, and the direction in which the slot extends from its initial
square (Â“acrossÂ” or Â“downÂ”). The length of each slot is not specified. The puzzle has a list of candidate words, all
but one of which is used in solving the puzzle.

<p align=center><img src=p2234a.gif>

<p>
Figure 2 shows a solution to the example puzzle in Figure 1. In a valid solution, each slot is filled with a candidate
word. The word at a slot is defined as the maximal horizontal/vertical sequence from the origin of the slot, along its
direction. Further more, the previous grid of the origin along the direction must not be a letter (which would be confusing).
The set of words at all slots must be the set of input words excluding an extra word. Any
candidate word can be used in any slot as long as the word fits in the puzzle and does not conflict with any other
word. In the example, all the candidate words are used except the word Â“BOYÂ”.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input data consist of one or more test cases each describing a puzzle trial. The first input line in each test case
contains a positive integer <i>N</i> that represents the number of slots in the puzzle. This line is followed by <i>N</i> lines, each
containing the row number and column number of a square where a slot begins, followed by the letter <i>Â‘AÂ’</i> (if the slot
is <i>Â“AcrossÂ”</i>) or <i>Â‘DÂ’</i> (if the slot is <i>Â“DownÂ”</i>). The next <i>N + 1</i> input lines contain candidate words that can be used in
the puzzle solution. Words are mutually different. All the words have at least two characters. 

<p>
The final test case is followed by a line containing the number zero.

For each trial, print the trial number followed by the word that is not used in the puzzle solution, using the format in
the example output. Observe the following rules:
<blockquote>
1) Print a blank line after each trial.<br><br>
2) If your uncle has made a mistake and the puzzle has no solution using the given words, print the word
Â“ImpossibleÂ”. For example, if Trial 2 has no solution, you should print Â“Trial 2: ImpossibleÂ”.<br><br>
3) If the puzzle can be solved in more than one way, print each word that can be omitted from a valid solution. The
words can be printed in any order but each word must be printed only once. For example, if Trial 3 has a
solution that omits the word DOG and two solutions that omit the word CAT, you should print Â“Trial 3:
DOG CATÂ” or Â“Trial 3: CAT DOGÂ”.

Once upon a time, in a country far away, there was a king who owned a forest of valuable trees. One day, to deal
with a cash flow problem, the king decided to cut down and sell some of his trees. He asked his wizard to find the
largest number of trees that could be safely cut down.

<p>
All the kingÂ’s trees stood within a rectangular fence, to protect them from thieves and vandals. Cutting down the
trees was difficult, since each tree needed room to fall without hitting and damaging other trees or the fence. Each
tree could be trimmed of branches before it was cut. For simplicity, the wizard assumed that when each tree was cut
down, it would occupy a rectangular space on the ground, as shown below. One of the sides of the rectangle is a
diameter of the original base of the tree. The other dimension of the rectangle is equal to the height of the tree.

<p align=center><img src=p2235a.gif>

<p>
Many of the kingÂ’s trees were located near other trees (that being one of the tell-tale signs of a forest.) The wizard
needed to find the maximum number of trees that could be cut down, one after another, in such a way that no fallen
tree would touch any other tree or the fence. As soon as each tree falls, it is cut into pieces and carried away so it
does not interfere with the next tree to be cut.


<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input consists of several test cases each describing a forest. The first line of each description contains five
integers, <i>xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax,</i> and <i>n</i>. The first four numbers represent the minimal and maximal coordinates of
the fence in the x- and y-directions (<i>xmin < xmax, ymin < ymax</i>). The fence is rectangular and its sides are parallel to
the coordinate axes. The fifth number <i>n</i> represents the number of trees in the forest (<i>1 &le; n &le; 100</i>).

<p>
The next <i>n</i> lines describe the positions and dimensions of the <i>n</i> trees. Each line contains four integers, <i>x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, d<sub>i</sub>,</i> and
<i>h<sub>i</sub></i>, representing the position of the treeÂ’s center (<i>x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub></i>), its base diameter <i>d<sub>i</sub></i>, and its height <i>h<sub>i</sub></i>. No tree bases touch
each other, and all the trees are entirely inside the fence, not touching the fence at all.

<p>
The input is terminated by a test case with xmin = ymin = xmax = ymax = n = 0. This test case should not be
processed.

Researchers at the Association for Computational Marinelife in Vancouver have been working for several years to
harness various forms of aquatic life with the goal of constructing an underwater computer that can be seen from
outer space. The current research focus is a breed of clam known as the geoduck (pronounced "GOOEY duck"),
scientific name <i>Panope abrupta</i>. Geoducks can be as heavy as ten pounds and as long as 1 meter with their siphons
or "necks" fully extended. Because of their life expectancy (up to 150 years), they seem to be good agents for
manipulating a large-scale oceanic graphical user interface - hence, the "geoduck GUI" project.

<p>
Current research examines pairs of trained geoducks each starting in a distinct corner of a rectangular grid. They
crawl across the grid spreading luminescent chemicals from containers attached to their shells. Geoducks are trained
to move one grid unit horizontally or vertically per time unit to approximate a direction vector (each geoduck has a
unique vector). If a move takes a geoduck off the edge of the grid, a trained dolphin immediately transports it to the
cell on the opposite edge of the grid, effectively providing a "wraparound" mechanism. The entry point in the
opposite edge cell is horizontally or vertically aligned with the exit point of the cell departed and the geoduck
trajectory is maintained. Geoduck moves are synchronized; however, a geoduck halts when it enters a cell that it has
previously visited. If two geoducks are in the same cell at the same time, they halt in that cell. If two geoducks
attempt to move into each otherÂ’s cells at the same time, then they halt. A geoduck is initially placed at a grid corner
so that its direction vector points "in" to the grid (e.g., if the x-component is positive and the y-component is
negative, the starting position is at the minimum x-value and the maximum y-value in the grid).

<p>
Both geoducks begin at time t=1 in their respective (distinct) starting corners. A geoduck follows its vector as if the
vector starting point were anchored to the center of geoduckÂ’s initial cell position in the grid. It always moves to the
next cell that is divided into regions by the vector (or its extension), with one exception. If the vector passes through
a corner of the grid, the geoduck moves horizontally and then vertically to reach the next cell divided by the vector.
Figure 1 shows several geoduck paths. The numbers in the cells indicate elapsed time. Grid cells are numbered from
the lower left starting at zero in both the x and y directions. If the two geoducks in Figure 1 start at the same time in
the same 6 by 5 grid, they each halt after 5 time units with a total of 10 cells illuminated.

<p align=center><img src=p2236a.gif>

<p>
You must write a program to select pairs of geoducks that illuminate the maximum number of grid cells on the
screen in the least amount of time. Note that there may be some extra timesteps needed after the maximum illumination is achieved, before they halt. Repeat your calculations for various grid sizes and comb inations of geoducks.

Input consists of a sequence of test cases each beginning with a line containing two integers <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>, <i>1 &le; m,n &le; 50</i>,
where <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are not both 1. These are x and y dimensions of the grid. The second line of each test case contains an
integer <i>k, 2 &le; k &le; 10</i>, representing the number of geoducks. At least one pair of geoducks will have distinct starting
points. The next <i>k</i> lines each contain a pair of non-zero integers representing the x and y components of the <i>k</i>
geoduck direction vectors.

The final test case is followed by two zeros.

In western music, the 12 notes used in musical notation are identified with the capital letters A through G, possibly
followed by a sharp '#' or flat 'b' character, and are arranged cyclically as shown below. A slash is used to identify
alternate notations of the same note.

<p>
C/B# C#/Db D D#/Eb E/Fb F/E# F#/Gb G G#/Ab A A#/Bb B/Cb C/B# Â…

<p>
Any two adjacent notes in the above list are known as a semitone. Any two notes that have exactly one note
separating them in the above list are known as a tone. A major scale is composed of eight notes; it begins on one of
the above notes and follows the progression tone-tone-semitone-tone-tone-tone-semitone. For example, the major
scales starting on C and Db, respectively, are made up of the following notes:

<p>
C D E F G A B C
Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C Db

<p>
The following rules also apply to major scales:
<blockquote>
1. The scale will contain each letter from A to G once and only once, with the exception of the first letter of the
scale, which is repeated as the last letter of the scale.<br>
2. The scale may not contain a combination of both flat and sharp notes.
</blockquote>

<p>
The note that begins a major scale is referred to as the key of the scale. For example, the scales above are the scales
for the major keys of C and Db, respectively. Transposing notes from one scale to another is a simple matter of
replacing a note in one scale with the note in the corresponding position of another scale. For example, the note F in
the major key of C would transpose to the note Gb in the major key of Db since both notes occupy the same position
in their respective scales.

<p>
You must write a program to transpose notes from one major scale to another.


<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input consists of multiple test cases, with one test case per line. Each line starts with a source key, followed by a
target key, and then followed by a list of notes to be transposed from the major scale of the source key to the major
scale of the target key. Each list is terminated by a single asterisk character. All notes on a line and the terminating
asterisk are delimited by a single space.

<p>
The final line of the input contains only a single asterisk which is not to be processed as a test case .

<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
Each test case produces one or more lines of output. If the source and target keys are valid, then the first output line
for each input line should read <i>Â“Transposing from X to Y:Â”</i> where <i>X</i> is the source key and <i>Y</i> is the target
key. If either the source or target key is not valid a line which reads <i>Â“Key of X/Y is not a valid major
keyÂ”</i>, where <i>X/Y</i> is the key that is not valid, should be output and the remainder of the input for that line skipped. If
both the source and target key are not valid, report only the source key.

<p>
For test cases that contain valid source and target keys, the first output line will be followed by one output line for
each note to be transposed. If the note is a valid note in the major scale of the source key then the output line should
read <i>Â“M transposes to NÂ”</i> where <i>M</i> is the note in the source key and <i>N</i> is the corresponding note in the target
key. If the input note is not a valid note in the major scale of the source key then the output line should read <i>Â“M is
not a valid note in the X major scaleÂ”</i> where <i>M</i> is the input note and <i>X</i> is the source key. For
either valid or non-valid notes, the output line should be indented in a consistent manner.

<p>
The output data for each input line should be delimited by a single blank line. The format of your output should be
similar to the output shown below.

A technique used in early multiprogramming operating systems involved partitioning the available primary memory
into a number of regions with each region having a fixed size, different regions potentially having different sizes.
The sum of the sizes of all regions equals the size of the primary memory.

<p>
Given a set of programs, it was the task of the operating system to assign the programs to different memory regions,
so that they could be executed concurrently. This was made difficult due to the fact that the execution time of a
program might depend on the amount of memory available to it. Every program has a minimum space requirement,
but if it is assigned to a larger memory region its execution time might increase or decrease.

<p>
In this program, you have to determine optimal assignments of programs to memory regions. Your program is given
the sizes of the memory regions available for the execution of programs, and for each program a description of how
its running time depends on the amount of memory available to it. Your program has to find the execution schedule
of the programs that minimizes the average turnaround time for the programs. An execution schedule is an
assignment of programs to memory regions and times, such that no two programs use the same memory region at
the same time, and no program is assigned to a memory region of size less than its minimum memory requirement.
The turnaround time of the program is the difference between the time when the program was submitted for
execution (which is time zero for all programs in this problem), and the time that the program completes execution.


<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input data will contain multiple test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing a pair of integers <i>m</i> and
<i>n</i>. The number <i>m</i> specifies the number of regions into which primary memory has been partitioned (<i>1 &le; m &le; 10</i>), and
<i>n</i> specifies the number of programs to be executed (<i>1 &le; n &le; 50</i>).

<p>
The next line contains <i>m</i> positive integers giving the sizes of the <i>m</i> memory regions. Following this are <i>n</i> lines,
describing the time-space tradeoffs for each of the <i>n</i> programs. Each line starts with a positive integer <i>k</i> (<i>k &le; 10</i>),
followed by <i>k</i> pairs of positive integers <i>s<sub>1</sub>,t<sub>1</sub>,s<sub>2</sub>,t<sub>2</sub>,Â…,s<sub>k</sub>,t<sub>k</sub>,</i> that satisfy <i>s<sub>i</sub> < s<sub>i+1</sub></i> for <i>1 &le; i < k</i>. The minimum space
requirement of the program is <i>s<sub>1</sub></i>, i.e. it cannot run in a partition of size less than this number. If the program runs in
a memory partition of size <i>s</i>, where <i>s<sub>i</sub> &le; s < s<sub>i+1</sub></i> for some <i>i</i>, then its execution time will be ti. Finally, if the programs
runs in a memory partition of size sk or more, then its execution time will be tk.

<p>
A pair of zeroes will follow the input for the last test case.

<p>
You may assume that each program will execute in exactly the time specified for the given region size, regardless of
the number of other programs in the system. No program will have a memory requirement larger than that of the
largest memory region.

<P>

</H2>
For each test case, first display the case number (starting with 1 and increasing sequentially). Then print the
minimum average turnaround time for the set of programs with two digits to the right of the decimal point. Follow
this by the description of an execution schedule that achieves this average turnaround time. Display one line for each
program, in the order they were given in the input, that identifies the program number, the region in which it was
executed (numbered in the order given in the input), the time when the program started execution, and the time when
the program completed execution. Follow the format shown in the sample output, and print a blank line after each
test case.

<p>
If there are multiple program orderings or assignments to memory regions that yield the same minimum average

Professor Monotonic has been experimenting with comparison networks, each of which includes a number of two-input,
two-output comparators. A comparator, as illustrated below, will compare the values on its inputs, i<sub>1</sub> and i<sub>2</sub>,
and place them on the outputs, o<sub>1</sub> and o<sub>2</sub>, so that o<sub>1</sub> &le; o<sub>2</sub> regardless of the relationship between the input values.

<p align=center><img src=p2239a.gif>

<p>
A comparison network has n inputs a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,Â…,a<sub>n</sub> and n outputs b<sub>1</sub>,b<sub>2</sub>,Â…,b<sub>n</sub>. Each of the two inputs to a comparator is
either connected to one of the networkÂ’s n inputs or connected to the output of another comparator. Each of the two
outputs from a comparator is either connected to one of the networkÂ’s n outputs or is connected to the input of
another comparator. A graph of the interconnections of comparators must be acyclic. The illustration below shows a
comparison network with four inputs, four outputs, and five comparators.

<p align=center><img src=p2239b.gif>

<p>
In operation, the networkÂ’s inputs are applied and the comparators perform their functions. Of course a comparator
cannot operate until both of its inputs are available. Assuming a comparator requires one unit of time to operate, this
sample network will require three units of time to produce its outputs. Comp -1 and Comp-2 operate in parallel, as do
Comp-3 and Comp-4. Comp-5 cannot operate until Comp -3 and Comp-4 have completed their work.

<p>
Professor Monotonic needs help in determining which proposed comparison networks are also sorting networks, and
how long they will take to perform their task. A sorting network is a comparison network for which the outputs are
monotonically increasing regardless of the input values. The example above is a sorting network, since for all
possible input values the output values will have the relation b<sub>1</sub> &le; b<sub>2</sub> &le; b<sub>3</sub> &le; b<sub>4</sub>.

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The professor will provide a description of each comparison network to be examined. Each description will begin
with a line containing values for n (the number of inputs) and k (the number of comparators). These values satisfy
<i>1 = n = 12</i> and <i>0 = k = 150</i>. This is followed by zero or more non-empty lines, each containing at most 15 pairs of
comparator inputs. The source of the input to each comparator is given by a pair of integers <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. Each of these
specifies either the subscript of a network input that is input to the comparator (that is, <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> or <i>a<sub>j</sub></i>), or the corresponding
output of a preceding comparator.

<p>
The outputs of a comparator are numbered the same as its inputs (in other words, if the comparatorÂ’s inputs are <i>i</i> and
<i>j</i>, the corresponding outputs are also labeled <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>). The order in which these pairs appear is significant, and affects
the order in which the comparators operate. If two pairs contain an integer in common, the order of the
corresponding comparators in the network is determined by the order of the pairs in the list. For example, consider
the input data for the example shown:
<blockquote>
<pre>
4   5
1   2    3   4    1   3
2   4    2   3
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This indicates there will be four input values and five comparators in the network. The first comparator (Comp -1)
will receive its input values from network inputs a<sub>1</sub> and a<sub>2</sub>. The second comp arator (Comp -2) will receive its input
values from network inputs a<sub>3</sub> and a<sub>4</sub>. The third comparator (Comp -3) will receive its first input from the first output
of Comp -1, and will receive its second input from the first output of Comp -2. Similarly, the fourth comparator
(Comp-4) will receive its first input from the second output of Comp -1, and will receive its second input from the
second output of Comp -2. Finally, the fifth comparator (Comp -5) will receive its first input from the first output of
Comp-4, and will receive its second input from the second output of Comp -3. The outputs b<sub>1</sub>,b<sub>2</sub>,Â…,b<sub>n</sub> are taken from
the first output of Comp -3, the first output of Comp -5, the second output of Comp -5, and the second output of
Comp-4, respectively.

The game Vexed is a Tetris -like game created by James McCombe. The game consists of a board and blocks that are
arranged in stacks. If the space to the immediate left or right of a block is open (that is, it contains no other block nor
any part of the game board Â“wallÂ”), then that block can be moved in that direction. Only blocks that are not part of
the game board wall can be moved; Â“wallÂ” blocks are stationary in all events. After a block is moved, if it or any
other block no longer has anything under it, those blocks fall until they land on another block. After all blocks have
landed, if any two or more identically-marked pieces are in contact horizontally and/or vertically, then those blocks
are removed as a group. If multiple such groups result, then all groups are removed simultaneously. After all such
groups are removed, all blocks again fall to resting positions (again, wall blocks do not move). This might then
result in more groups being removed, more blocks falling, and so on, until a stable state is reached. The goal of the
game is to remove all the movable blocks from the board.

<p>
Consider the simple example shown here. For reference purposes, number the rows of the board from top to bottom
starting with an index value of zero, and number the columns from the left to right, also with a starting index value
of zero. Board positions can be therefore be referenced as ordered (row, column) pairs. By additionally using an Â“LÂ”
or Â“RÂ” to refer to a left or right push respectively, we can also use the ordered triple (row, column, direction) to
indicate moves.

<p align=center><img src=p2240a.gif>

<p>
In (A) we have two choices for moves as shown in (B). These moves are (0,1,R) and (1,3,L) using the identification
scheme defined above. Note that if we try (0,1,R), the resulting board state as shown in (C) is a dead end; no further
moves are possible and blocks still remain on the board. If we choose the other move, however, the blocks at (1,2)
and (2,2) are now in vertical contact, so they form a group that should be removed as shown by (D). The resulting
board state is shown in (E), leaving the two moves shown by (F). Note that either move would eventually allow a
solution, but (0,1,R) leads to a two move solution, whereas (2,1,R) leads to a three move solution. (G) and (H) show
the final steps if we choose (0,1,R).

<p>
There are often many ways to solve a particular Vexed puzzle. For this problem, only solutions with a minimum
number of moves are of interest. The minimum number of moves can sometimes be surprising. Consider another
example.

<p align=center><img src=p2240b.gif>

<p>
In this example there are ten possible first moves, and there are in fact several ways to arrive at a solution. There is
only one move in (A), however, that allows us to achieve a solution with the minimum number of moves. Observe
the sequence of events shown if (3,1,R) is chosen as the first move.


<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input will consist of several puzzles. Each begins with a line containing integers giving the number of rows
(NR) and columns (NC) in the puzzle, and a string of characters (terminated by the end of line) giving the name of
the puzzle; these items are separated by one or more spaces. This line is followed by an NR by NC array of
characters defining the puzzle itself; an end of line will follow the last character in each row. NR and NC will each
be no larger than 9. The Â“outer wallsÂ” (in addition to Â“inner wallÂ” blocks) on the left, right, and bottom will always
be included as part of the puzzle input, and are represented as hash mark (#) characters. Moveable blocks are
represented by capital letters which indicate the marking on the block. To avoid possible ambiguities, open spaces in
the puzzle are represented in the input by a hyphen (Â–) rather than by spaces. Other than the outer walls, wall blocks
and moveable blocks may be arranged in any stable pattern. Every input puzzle is guaranteed to have a solution
requiring 11 or fewer moves.

<p>
A puzzle with zero dimensions marks the end of the input and should not be processed.

Stockbrokers are known to overreact to rumours. You have been contracted to develop a
method of spreading disinformation amongst the stockbrokers to give your employer the
tactical edge in the stock market. For maximum effect, you have to spread the rumours in
the fastest possible way.

<P>
Unfortunately for you, stockbrokers only trust information coming from their `trusted
sources'. This means you have to take into account the structure of their contacts when
starting a rumour. It takes a certain amount of time for a specific stockbroker to pass the
rumour on to each of his colleagues. Your task will be to write a program that tells you
which stockbroker to choose as your starting point for the rumour, as well as the time it
will take for the rumour to spread throughout the stockbroker community. This duration is
measured as the time needed for the last person to receive the information.

<P>

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
Your program will input data for different sets of stockbrokers.
 Each set starts with a line
with the number of stockbrokers. Following this is a line for each
stockbroker which contains the number of people who they have
contact with, who these people are, and the time taken for them to
pass the message to each person. The format of each stockbroker
line is as follows: The line starts with the number of contacts
(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>), followed by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> pairs of integers, one pair for each
contact. Each pair lists first a number referring to the contact
(e.g. a `<TT>1</TT>' means person number one in the set), followed by
the time in minutes taken to pass a message to that person. There
are no special punctuation symbols or spacing rules.

<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
For each set of data, your program must output a single line
containing the person who results in the fastest message
transmission, and how long before the last person will receive any
given message after you give it to this person, measured in
integer minutes.

<P>
Each person is numbered 1 through to the number of stockbrokers. The time taken to
pass the message on will be between 1 and 10 minutes (inclusive), and the number of
contacts will range between 0 and one less than the number of stockbrokers. The number
of stockbrokers will range from 1 to 100. The input file is terminated by a set of
stockbrokers containing 0 (zero) people.

<P>
It is possible that your program will receive a network of connections that excludes some
persons, i.e. some people may be unreachable. If your program
detects such a broken network, simply output the message `<TT>disjoint</TT>'.  Note that the time taken to pass the message from
person A to person B is not necessarily the same as the time taken
to pass it from B to A, if such transmission is possible at all.

<P>When a radio station is broadcasting over a very large area, repeaters are used to retransmit the signal so that every receiver has a strong signal. However, the channels used by each repeater must be carefully chosen so that nearby repeaters do not interfere with one another. This condition is satisfied if adjacent repeaters use different channels. Since the radio frequency spectrum is a precious resource, the number of channels required by a given network of repeaters should be minimised. You have to write a program that reads in a description of a repeater network and determines the minimum number of channels required.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of a number of maps of repeater networks.

You are in charge of security at a top-secret government research
facility. Recently your government has captured a live
extra-terrestrial (ET) life form, and is hosting an open day for
fellow researchers. Of course, not all the guests can be trusted,
so they are assigned different security clearance levels. Only
guests with a level 5 rating will be allowed into the lab where
the extra-terrestrial is being held; other than that, everyone is
free to roam throughout the rest of the facility. Each room in the
facility is connected via one-way airlocks, so that you can pass
through the door in only one direction.

<P>
To protect your precious ET you will put in place enhanced
security measures (in the form of armed guards) on the route
leading to the room containing the ET, but not in the room itself
Ã° the guards do not have sufficient clearance to enter the room
containing the ET. The guards will check the identity and the
security rating of all guests trying to pass through the room in
which they are stationed, so you would like to place the guards
where they will cause the minimum amount of irritation to the
guests who have no intention of visiting the ET. The room where
the guards must be placed thus satisfies the following two
conditions:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>In order to get to the room containing the ET, the guests
must pass through the   room containing the guards;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>There is no other room with this property that is closer to the room
containing the ET - remember, the guards cannot be placed in the room containing the ET itself.

You have been contracted by a terrorist group to crack encrypted
transmissions. The only information that the terrorists could give
you regarding the encrypted message is that a fixed key-length
XOR-encryption algorithm was used to encode it. After a brief
search on the 'Net, you find the following definition of
XOR-encryption:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Assuming that we have a character <I>u</I>[<I>i</I>] from the unencrypted
input stream, and a key <I>k</I> of length <I>l</I> with characters <I>k</I>[<I>j</I>],

0 &le; <I>j</I> &lt; <I>l</I>, then the encrypted
value <I>e</I>[<I>i</I>] is obtained as follows:

</center>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

where MOD is the remainder after integer division (the %
operator in C, C++ and Java), and XOR is the bitwise XOR operator
applied to an 8-bit character (the <code>^</code> operator in C, C++ and Java).
XOR encryption is a symmetric encryption scheme, so that the
message is decoded by encrypting the encrypted message (a second
time) with the same key, so that

You are given an encrypted input stream of fewer than 30 000
characters. Your program must output the decrypted stream. The
stream was encrypted using XOR encryption with a fixed length key
of fewer than 30 characters. Each character in the key is unique
(appears only once), and is selected from the set a..z merged with
0..9.

<P>
Your task is to determine the correct key length, and decrypt the
encrypted input stream. Your terrorist friends provided you with
one last vital piece of information: ``The decrypted message will
be in English."

<P>
It is recommended that you write an XOR encryption program first

The output of the XOR encryption algorithm is not normally
printable, since it may contain ASCII codes greater than 127.
Therefore, the sample-encrypted message below is shown in
numerical ASCII values (in decimal) - the actual input file
contains the ASCII symbols. If the message ``<TT>the quick brown
fox jumps over the lazy dog</TT>" is encrypted using the key "12" (the
literal characters "1" and "2", concatenated), the following
(binary) file results.

The <EM>digital root</EM> of a number is found by adding together the
digits that make up the number. If the resulting number has more
than one digit, the process is repeated until a single digit
remains.

 Your task in this problem is to calculate a variation on
the digital root --a <EM>prime digital root</EM>. The addition
process described above stops when there is only one digit left,
but will also stop if the original number, or any of the
intermediate numbers (formed by addition) are prime numbers. If
the process continues and results in a single digit that is not a
prime number, then the original number has no prime digital root.

<P>
<BR>
An integer <EM>greater than</EM> one is called a prime number if its only
positive divisors (factors) are one and itself.

<UL>
<LI>For example, the first six primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

</LI>
<LI>Number 6 has four positive divisors: 6, 3, 2, and 1. Thus
number 6 is <EM>not</EM> a prime.

</LI>
<LI>Caveat: number 1 is <EM>not</EM> a prime.

<p>This problem requires you to search a black and white satellite image of a desert for a secret building complex with a given shape. A complex of this given shape may host an installation for producing the strategic xeenium macgillicudamate ingredient, and must keep its orientation with regard to cardinal axes (North-East-South-West). Rotations and mirror images are not allowed because they would interfere with the delicate alchemy required for the production process.

<p>A histogram is a bar graph, and a convenient way to view a distribution of values. Each bar of the graph represents a range of values, and the length of a bar represents the number of input values in that range. Your program must read a collection of non-negative integer input values, and display it as a histogram. The bars of the histogram are represented as horizontal rows of `<TT>#</TT>' characters. The parameters of the histogram are:<UL><LI>the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>lo</I></SPAN> bound (the lowest value that the histogram can represent) </LI><LI>the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>step</I></SPAN> size (the range of values represented by a single bar) </LI></UL><p>The bars of the histogram are numbered from 0 up to some maximum number. The number of `<TT>#</TT>' characters in histogram bar number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> is the number of input values which lie between <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>lo</I> + <I>n</I>*<I>step</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>lo</I> + (<I>n</I> + 1)*<I>step</I> - 1</SPAN>. So bar 3 of a histogram where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>lo</I></SPAN> is 5 and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>step</I></SPAN> is 10 will represent values between 35 and 44, bar 4 of the same histogram will represent values from 45 to 54. For this problem, all input values, and the histogram parameters, are non-negative integers. Histogram parameters must be chosen to be ``nice'' round numbers that will allow the histogram to have no more than 20 bars. The constraints are as follows:<UL><LI>The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>step</I></SPAN> size must be 1 or 2 or 5, possibly multiplied by some positive integer power of 10. For example: 2, 100, 5000. The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>step</I></SPAN> size is thus an integer. </LI><LI>The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>lo</I></SPAN> bound must be some multiple of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>step</I></SPAN> size. </LI><LI>The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>lo</I></SPAN> bound and the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>step</I></SPAN> size must be chosen so that the minimum input value counts towards the first histogram bar, and the maximum input value counts towards a histogram bar number which is less than 20, but otherwise is as large as possible. That is, the histogram <EM>has as many bars as possible</EM>, up to a <EM>maximum</EM> of 20. </LI></UL><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>The input to your program consists of a series of data sets. Each data set begins with a single integer in the range 2 to 500 inclusive, on a line by itself. This is the number of input values. It is followed by the non-negative integer data values, which may be split across lines arbitrarily. The entire input is terminated by an empty data set (where the initial count is zero).<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>For each data set, the program must print out the corresponding histogram. The histogram is a series of histogram bars, one to a line. Each bar is preceded by the bottom of the range of values for that bar, displayed right justified in a field eight characters wide. This bound is followed by one space, and then a row of `<TT>#</TT>' characters, corresponding to the number of input values for this histogram bar. The input data is such that no bar will have more than 70 <TT>#</TT>'s. The histogram should be printed from the first non-empty bar to the last non-empty bar, inclusive, and should be followed by one blank line. As a special case, if all input values in a given set are equal, then no histogram is displayed, and the program must give a line exactly in the following form:<P><BR><code>All inputs equal 15.</code><P><BR>There must be exactly three spaces at the positions indicated, and a full stop at the end of the line.

<p>Most text encryption schemes use a secret key string to convert the plain text to the enciphered text in some way. A novel method being tested by the Australian Security Service consists of a transformation of a key string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> into a target string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> using block moves. Each <EM>block move</EM> is of the form <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>copy</I>(<I>start</I>, <I>length</I>)</SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>start</I></SPAN> indicates a position in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>length</I></SPAN> is the number of characters to be copied from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>. Since the idea is to eventually transmit only the block moves, the principle is to use as few block moves as possible. For example if:<BR><BR><TABLE COLS=1><COL ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><code>K: abaabba</code></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><code>P: aaabbbabbbaaa</code></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR>Assuming that here string positions start with 1, two shortest block move sequences would be:<BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>copy</I>(3, 2);<I>copy</I>(4, 3);<I>copy</I>(2, 2);<I>copy</I>(5, 2);<I>copy</I>(2, 3);<I>copy</I>(1, 1)</SPAN><BR><BR>or<BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>copy</I>(7, 1);<I>copy</I>(3, 3);<I>copy</I>(5, 2);<I>copy</I>(4, 2);<I>copy</I>(5, 3);<I>copy</I>(3, 2)</SPAN><BR><BR>The actual shortest block move sequences are not unique but the minimum number is, 6 in this case. If the moves are now transmitted, then it is possible to construct the plaintext message <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> from the key string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>. The Australian Security Service is now automating this procedure, so given <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> they need to count the minimum number of block moves from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>. To make things simple at the beginning, they are considering strings comprised of lowercase letters and digits. The set of characters within string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> is a subset of the set of characters of the key string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>. You are to help the Australian Security Service by writing a program to get two strings <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> as above, and print the minimum number of block moves from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>.<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>Your code will be tested with a sequence of lines.

<p>Under certain conditions volcanic basalt forms large crystals, like hexagonal pillars.
At Fingal Head, at the border of New South Wales and Queensland, there is a
dramatic example, called Giant's Causeway, where a peninsula formed of such
columns juts into the Pacific. It is particularly dramatic when the big Pacific rollers
break on the causeway, leaving streams of water cascading over the basalt pillars.

<p>Your task is to find out how much water could collect in hexagonal hollows, formed
when some pillars are shorter than others, and can act as wells.

<p>Here is a diagram of a set of hexagons. Each hexagon has an integer height. Water
can always cascade off the edge of the set of hexagons, but it will collect in the five
shaded hexagons, since they form wells completely surrounded by higher hexagons.
Water drains from the left hand pair over two pillars of height six, and from the three
on the right water drains over a pillar of height seven. Assuming each hexagon has
unit area, the volume of water that can collect is 17 units.

Your program must handle input as a series of problem descriptions.

Each problem begins with two integers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>, on a line by themselves, in the range
1 to 200 inclusive, giving the number of hexagons along an <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN>-axis, and along a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>-axis,
as shown in the diagram. Then there are given a further <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I>*<I>Y</I></SPAN> integers, in the range 0
to 5000 inclusive, which are the heights of the hexagons. The order of input heights is
given as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> rows of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> integers, but they may be split across lines arbitrarily.

The given diagram is described by sample input below.

The Mooville city officials have been trying to bring in business and 
entertainment to their small town.
Recently, the ferry closed the canal that passes through the town. After
witnessing a water ski show at Cypress Gardens, Mayor Moocky came up with an
interesting twist that might just suit his small town. Every Saturday night on
the closed canal, they will stage a ski jumping dual jump, using two connected
ramps, where skiers will approach from opposite ends of the canal and jump over
the ramp simultaneously.  (The boats
don't hit each other because they are kept perfectly straight on opposite sides
of the canal.)  The problem is, the
boats they will use have different top speeds and accelerations, so they need
to figure out what point on the canal to place the grandstands each week.

<P>
Given a length of canal with a boat
at each end, and the acceleration and top speed of each boat, determine the
meeting point. (You may assume each boat has constant acceleration until top
speed is reached and they continue at top speed until after the amazing jump.)

Each input line contains five
integer values separated by white space. The first integer will be the length
of the canal in miles and will be between 1 and 20. The second integer will be
the top speed of boat A and the third integer will be the acceleration of boat
A. The fourth integer will be the top speed of boat B and the fifth integer
will be the acceleration of boat B. The top speed of a boat will be in miles
per hour and will be greater than zero. The acceleration of a boat will be
given in miles per hour per second and will be greater than zero. The last line
of the input file will have a canal length value of zero.

As your
company's network manager, you have become concerned about how slow your
Internet connection seems to be in the afternoons.  You have a fixed
high-speed connection, so you suspect the problem is that too many employees are downloading music and video files,
overloading your link.  To test your theory, you have already hooked up a Linux box to your Internet connection,
running the &#168;tcpdump&#168; program to monitor all network traffic.
That program produced several huge text files, each with a detailed log of every network packet that passed between
your company and the rest of the Internet during each tcpdump run.

<P>
Now your problem is to make sense of the logs, because looking at files with tens of
thousands of records each makes your head hurt.  Your task for this
problem is to write a program that will read
the information in the log files, and then print out a short, useful summary
report. That report will be a list of
the top ten Internet addresses, ranked by total network traffic, and a list of
the top ten internal network users, again ranked by network traffic.

Each tcpdump-record is a single line, no longer than 255 characters long, and
terminated by an end-of-line marker. The fields <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>timestamp</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>protocol</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>interface</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>size</I></SPAN>,
and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>between</I></SPAN> are all sequences of characters that do not contain
end-of-line markers or semi-colons. If
there is an <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>optional</I></SPAN> field, it may contain any character other than an
end-of-line marker. The only fields you
need to use are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>size</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>between</I></SPAN>.

<P>
The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>size</I></SPAN> field contains an integer in the range of 1 to 32767, followed by a single
space, followed by the string `<TT>bytes</TT>'
(not including the quotation marks.) For example, if the packet is
412 bytes long, the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>size</I></SPAN> field will be `<TT>412 bytes</TT>'. 
Even if the field is only 1 byte long, it will look like `<TT>1 bytes</TT>'.

<P>
The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>between</I></SPAN> field is in the form `<TT>from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>source</I></SPAN>:<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>port</I></SPAN>
to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>dest</I></SPAN>:<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>port</I></SPAN></TT>'. The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>source</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>dest</I></SPAN> fields are each distinct and valid IP
addresses. An IP address consists of four integers in the range from 0 to 255
separated by periods (e.g., 127.12.255.0). The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>port</I></SPAN> field is an integer
in the range from 0 to 65535.

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Processing:</SPAN>

<P>
Each time a new description-line is read, a new, independent log is started.

<P>
As your program reads tcp-dump records, it will keep track of the total number of bytes
that passed to or from each IP address. It doesn't matter if an address is the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>source</I></SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>dest</I></SPAN>; if
it appears in a tcpdump-record, the value of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>size</I></SPAN> field is added to
the total being tracked for each of the two addresses. 

<P>
After determining all the totals for all IP addresses, your program will determine
the 10 external IP addresses that have the greatest number of bytes passed to
or from them, and the 10 internal IP addresses that have the greatest number of
bytes passed to or from them, and print those two ``top 10" lists,
suitably labeled and formatted. Each
list should be printed in descending order by number of bytes. 

<P>
An internal IP address is any address assigned to your company's own network.
Those addresses are recognized by their
prefixes. Any address in any of the
following formats is internal: <TT>192.168.<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN></TT>,
<TT>204.146.114.<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN></TT>, <TT>206.199.79.<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN></TT>,
where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> is any integer in the range from 0 to 255.
An external IP address is any IP address
that is not an internal IP address.

<P>
You may assume that there are at least 10 internal and 10 external IP addresses
represented in each section of the input data file.
There will be at most 12000 distinct IP addresses in any tcp-dump.

<P>
You may assume that the total number of bytes sent to or from a single IP address in
any single section of the input file is no more than 2147483647. 

<P>
You may assume that no tcpdump-record begins with either
<TT>END</TT> or <TT>TCP</TT>.

</H2>

<P>
The output file will contain a separate summary report for each tcpdump log in the input
file. The first line of the summary
report will be exactly the same as the tcpdump-description line read from the
input file. That will be followed by a
single blank line, then the following header line, beginning in column 1: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<TT>Top 10 External Sites Visited:</TT>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
That header line will be followed by ten lines, each showing the total number of
bytes seen passing to or from an external IP address, and the IP address.
The total number of bytes should be printed
in columns 1 through 10, right aligned in the field, followed by one space,
followed by the IP address, left aligned. 
The list should be printed in descending order by number of bytes.
If two sites have the same number of bytes,
they should be ordered lexicographically by IP address.
There will then be a single blank line,
followed by another header line, beginning in column 1:

That line will also be followed by ten lines in the same format as above, except using
internal IP address. A blank line

have been reported on. Here is a short example of a properly formatted output file:

Your
company regularly needs to distribute lots of files to other companies on
CD-ROMs. You've been given the job of
writing the program that takes a set of data files (file-set) to distribute,
and produces instructions specifying how many discs are needed, and lists which
files should be stored on which disc.   

<P>
A brute-force algorithm that gives the ``best" solution could be very expensive.
However, an algorithm that gives a ``pretty good" solution, known as
``first-fit descending-size", is described below.
(FYI: if the ``best" method would
require <EM>n</EM> discs to store all the files, this ``pretty good"
method will require at most 11/9 +4 discs.)

<P>
The
``first-fit descending-size" algorithm, which you must use in your
solution to this problem, is used to distribute the files in the file-set on a
set of discs (disc-set) numbered from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> will be
determined by the program. The files,
in descending order of size, are placed on the lowest numbered disc that has
enough room to hold the file. If the
file doesn't fit on any of the discs you've already started using, you will
need to add another disc to your disc-set. 

<P>
In processing the input, you should assume the following:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Each disc has a capacity of 675,840,000 bytes. 
</LI>
<LI>The amount of space required by a file is an integral multiple of 2048 bytes.
That is, any file with a size in the range
of 1 to 2048 bytes will use exactly 2048 bytes on the disc.
Any file within the range of 2049 to 4096
bytes will use exactly 4096 bytes on disc, and so on.
</LI>
<LI>A file of size 0 will not require any space on the disc.
</LI>
<LI>There will be no single file larger than 675,840,000 bytes.
</LI>
</OL>

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
Each non-signaling line will each describe one file in a file-set.
The first 9 characters will contain the size
(in bytes) of the file as a right-aligned decimal number.
Character 10 will always be blank.
Characters 11 through the end of the line will contain the filename.
You may assume that no file name is longer than 64 characters.
A line having both a file size of zero, and a
filename of ``<TT>END</TT>" will signal the
last file in the file-set. (This line is not
to be processed.) After this, other file-sets may follow. The end of file-sets
is signaled by an empty file-set.

<P>In this problem we will be using a one-bit error-correcting code called a Hamming code, which allows the receiver to correct any one-bit error in a binary sequence called a <EM>transmission string</EM>.

Since Bumpkins love fun, some of their doorways have been made intentionally short to force other Bumpkins to either crawl or limbo through the door.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Bumpkins don't all use the same set of measurements, so some heights are measured in inches, others in feet, others in yards, others in centimeters, and others in meters.&nbsp; To do the conversions, recall that:<P><UL><LI>1 inch = 2.54 centimeters </LI><LI>1 foot = 12 inches </LI><LI>1 yard = 3 feet </LI><LI>1 meter = 100 centimeters </LI></UL><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input file will begin with a single line, telling you how many Bumpkins want help.

<P>An important feature of smart game playing programs is the ability to evaluate the relative goodness of different game scenarios.<P>Tic-tac-toe is played on a three by three board by two players, who are traditionally called 'X' and 'O'. For the sake of this game, 'X' will move first. Play alternates between the players. Each player places exactly one of their markers on one of the blank spaces of the board. The game is won when one player has placed three of their markers in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. No moves are made once the game is won. Below are three snapshots of boards:<P><PRE> 
      Board 1         Board 2         Board 3

     O | X | O       O | X | O       O | X | O

    ---+---+---     ---+---+---     ---+---+---
     X |   |         X |   |         X | O |
</PRE><P>In Board 1, it is O's turn to move and Boards 2 and 3 show two of the possible moves O can make.<P>In deciding what move to next make, some players will see how many different final configurations are reachable from the current board and of those final configurations, how many would give the win to each of the players. From Board 2 above, there are 4 more reachable configurations, with 2 of them giving the win to X and 1 giving the win to O:<P><PRE> 
     No wins           O win           X win           X win

</PRE><P>Note that there is no assumption of intelligence in the players! While a human player might always work to win the game or block the opponent if possible, this problem is just asking for <EM>possible</EM> configurations, not <EM>smart</EM> ones.<P>From Board 3 above, there are 3 more reachable configurations, with 1 of them giving the win to X and none giving the win to O:<P><PRE>

</PRE><P>Your program must take an initial tic-tac-toe board and compute how many legal possible final configurations are reachable from the starting board, and in how many of those X wins, and in how many of those O wins. Your final configurations must have at least one move past the initial board in order to be counted.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input to this program will be a positive integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> which tells how many initial boards to examine.

<P>You will frequently see claims using percentages like: &#168;56.3% of all Florida tourists prefer Daytona Beach!&#168; But what do these claims <EM>really</EM> mean? In this program, you should determine the minimum sample size necessary to give a given percentage with a given number of decimal digits.<P>For this problem, percentages are computed by taking an integer divided by the sample size. For example, a percentage of 50% with 0 decimal digits could be obtained from a sample size of just 2, since 1/2 = 50%, but a percentage of 51% with 0 decimal digits would need a sample size of 35, since to get a value that would round to 51%, you need to use 18/35. No smaller sample size would give a percentage of 51%. Similarly, to get a percentage of 50.0% with 1 decimal digit, a sample size of 2 would still suffice, but it would take a sample size of 49 to get a percentage of 51.0% with one decimal digit. You should follow standard rounding rules where values of 5 and above round up to the next higher value and all others round down.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input to your program will be a list of 1 or more data sets where each data set consists of two numbers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN> is an integer, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">0<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/22/2263img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>d</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/22/2263img1.png ALT="$ \le$">5</SPAN>, indicating the number of significant decimal digits in the percentage, which is represented by p, <!-- MATH

<P>
Begin the output for each building
with a line containing only the name of the city where the building is
located. On the next line, output the
length of the longest dependency chain. 
Output all dependency chains meeting this length on succeeding lines,
one chain per line. Begin the output
for a chain with the name from the chain that comes first when the names are
sorted in increasing order. The order
of succeeding names in the chain should reflect the office swaps (for example,
<TT>C I U G</TT> is the correct output for the
Milledgeville building, <TT>C</TT> moves to the office originally occupied by <TT>I</TT>,
<TT>I</TT> moves to the office originally occupied by <TT>U</TT>, etc.; note that
<TT>C G U I</TT> is unacceptable output in this case because <TT>C</TT> does not move to
the office originally occupied by <TT>G</TT>).
If there are multiple dependency chains with the same length, 
list them in the output in increasing sorted order of the
first name in each list. Separate the output between buildings with a blank line. 
Follow the format illustrated in the Sample Output.

<P>Professor C. Ess bought 4 items at the 7-Eleven convenience store. As the cashier, Alec, was a former computer science student, Professor Ess thought it wise to double-check how his bill of $7.11 was calculated. Alec told him that he simply multiplied the prices of the items together. When Professor Ess objected that the amounts should have been added instead of multiplied, Alec replied that it didnt matter; the amount was the same either way. Sure enough, when Professor Ess multiplied his items for $1.20, $1.25, $1.50, and $3.16 together, the result was the same as their sum.<P>You are given a list of dollar amounts, and you are asked to find the prices of 4 items that, when multiplied, achieve exactly the same value as when added.

          <p>Anthrax, also called Splenic Fever, Malignant Pustule, or Woolsorters' 
            Disease, is caused by Bacillus anthracis, an organism that under certain 
            conditions forms highly resistant spores capable of maintaining its 
            virulent effect for many years in contaminated soil and other materials. 
            <br>
            Anthrax was the first human disease that was demonstrated to be caused 
            by a specific microorganism. It was also the first infectious disease 
            against which a bacterial vaccine was found to be effective (Louis 
            Pasteur in 1881). These discoveries led to the origin and development 
            of bacteriology and immunology. <br>
            Interest has reborn around the study of how infected cells reproduce 
            and die. A hypothesis states that cell reproduction can be modeled 
            as a two-dimensional infinite grid of square cells like chessboard 
            cells but in Practical lab studies its defined as finite grid. In 
            this grid, each cell is considered to be alive or dead. A living cell 
            is represented as a mark on its position in the grid. Each cell has 
            up to 8 neighboring cells (up, down, left, right, upper-right, upper-left, 
            lower-right and lower-left). Cells located in the border of the grid 
            have smaller number of neighbor.<br>
            The model starts with an Initial Generation <b>G</b>(<i>0</i>) consisting 
            of some living and death cells in the Grid. After reproduction rules 
            are applied to every Cell, a new Generation <b>G</b>(<i>1</i>) is 
            obtained. New generations are always created using the information 
            of the previous generation. That is Generation <b>G</b>(<i>i</i>) 
            is created based on information of Generation <b>G</b>(<i>i-1</i>).<br>
            The reproduction rules that are used in the model are: <br>
            1. A dead cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes a living 
            cell (birth). <br>
            2. A living cell with zero or one living neighbors dies (loneliness). 
            <br>
            3. A living cell with two or three living neighbors stays alive (survival). 
            <br>
            4. A living cell with four or more living neighbors dies (overcrowding). 
          </p>

            The first line has two numbers indicating the <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> 
            dimensions of the grid. (<b>X</b> number of columns, <b>Y</b> number 
            of rows). A <i>0</i> in this first line indicates end of run. <br>
            The second line is one number <b>n</b> representing the number of 
            generations that must be obtained. The third line is a number, that 
            specifies the number of cells that have a microorganism. Starting 
            in the forth line, there will be the coordinates of each microorganism, 
            one per line with format <b>x</b>, <b>y</b> (<b>x</b> is column number

          <p>In the output you have to show two different generations: first the 
            Initial Generation<b> G</b>(<i>0</i>), followed by the <b>n</b> Generation 
            <b>G</b>(<b>n</b>). A Generation is represented as a matrix showing 
            living microorganisms as an &quot;<i>*</i>&quot; (asterisk) and death 
            cells as a &quot;<i>0</i>&quot; (zero). In the first line of each 
            test you should output the study number (the number of the run). Before 
            the Initial Generation write the string &quot;<i>Initial Generation</i>&quot;. 
            Before each new generation write &quot;<i>Generation </i><b>n</b>&quot;, 
            where <b>n</b> is the generation number.</p>

<p>A farmer has decided to surround his garden in order to protect his fruits from the appetite of his neighbors. This man does not have a lot of money, but he is a very innovative person. He has found the possibility of reducing costs by using trees from his property as fence posts. He found that in order to maximize the area to be enclosed by the fence, the trees to be used as fence posts must be selected carefully avoiding the creation of inward angles in the fence. Also, the selection of tree posts must ensure that the fence will enclose all the trees that are in the property.<br><br><b>PROBLEM </b><br>Given a set of trees (each tree is identified by a unique tree identifier) and the position of each tree in the property, write a program that obtains the following information:<br>a) The minimum number of trees required to enclose all the trees in the property<br>b) The sequence of trees that must be used as tree posts.</p><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>The input file contains several tests.

The managers of a very large typography (with a virtually infinite number of resources - i.e. an infinite number and variety of printing machines) would like to know what is the minimum time required to fulfill a customer's order. An order is a request to print a certain number of magazines, or leaflets, or books etc. For each product that can be printed - there is a certain flow that must be followed. For example, first a machine takes single paper from a pile of paper, other machine cuts the paper to appropriate page dimensions, other machine prints one page, one collects the pages into a pile, and the last machine staples the pages together. Thus, the printing flow can be described by giving the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> operations required, the time consumed for each operation, and the dependencies between the operations (e.g. operations 0, 1, and 2 may start immediately, 3 may start after 2 completes, 4 may start after 1 and 3 are completed, and 5 may start after 1 is completed, and 6 may start after 0, 4 and 5 are completed).

The ``Great Expectations" Popular Bank is verifying the deposits it holds. A deposit is a pile of coins of equal weight. The secret service came with the information that <SPAN  CLASS="textit">precisely one coin from each deposit has been replaced with a counterfeit coin</SPAN>, which is lighter or heavier than any other coin in the deposit. Take for granted this information and write a program that verifies the deposits. For each deposit and the outcome of a series of weighting tests the program tries to find the bad coin and its relative weight. The program input is from a text file. Each data set in the file stands for a deposit and has the format:

The examples below span some possible cases of correct, inconsistent or incomplete input data. The first data set is for 3 coins and 2 weighting tests. The test 1 <SPAN CLASS="MATH">|</SPAN> 2 weights coins 1 and 2. Since the scale is in balance both coins are honest. The test 1 <!-- MATH

<SPAN CLASS="MATH">&#92;</SPAN> 3 weights coins 1 and 3. The scale tips left and, therefore, coin 3 is light. The second data set (3 coins, 2 tests) contradicts the problem assumption since all coins are honest.

<P>
In the third data set the weighting tests lead to contradictory conclusions: a) both 1 and 2 are honest, and b) one of 1 and 2 is counterfeit. In the fourth data set (3 coins, 1 weighting test) coin 3 is counterfeit but we do not know whether it is light or heavy. In the last data set one coin out of 3 and 4 is light but we cannot tell which.

<P>A color reduction is a mapping from a set of discrete colors to a smaller one.The solution to this problem requires that you perform just such a mapping in a standard twenty-four bit RGB color space.

<P>Morse code represents characters as variable length sequences of dots and dashes.In practice, characters in a message are delimited by short pauses. The following table shows the Morse code sequences:<P><PRE>
     A  .-           H  ....         O  ---          V  ...-
     B  -...         I  ..           P  .--.         W  .--

     G  --.          N  -.           U  ..-
</PRE><P>Note that four dot-dash combinations are unassigned. For the purposes of this problem we will assign them as follows (these are not the assignments for actual Morse code):<PRE>

                    comma  .-.-           question mark  ----
</PRE><P>Thus, the message ``<code>ACM_GREATER_NY_REGION</code>" is encoded as:<P><PRE>
.- -.-. -- ..-- --. .-. . .- - . .-. ..-- -. -.-- ..-- .-. . --. .. --- -.
</PRE><P>M.E. Ohaver proposed an encryption scheme based on mutilating Morse code.Her scheme replaces the pauses between letters, necessary because Morse is a variable-length encoding that is not prefix-free, with a string that identifies the number of dots and dashes in each. For example, consider the message ``.--.-.--". Without knowing where the pauses should be, this could be ``ACM", ``ANK", or several other possibilities. If we add length information, however, ``.--.-.--242", then the code is unabiguous.<P>Ohaver's scheme has three steps, the same for encryption and decryption:<P><OL><LI>Convert the text to Morse code without pauses but with a string of numbers to indicate code lengths<P></LI><LI>Reverse the string of numbers<P></LI><LI>Convert the dots and dashes back into to text using the reversed string of numbers as code lengths </LI></OL><P>As an example, consider the encrypted message ``<code>AKADTOF_IBOETATUK_IJN</code>".

</PRE><P><P><P><BR><B>Notes</B><P>As presented, this encryption scheme is only trivially secure. In fact it offers no security at all if the algorithm is known to the attacker. The key is the string of numbers needed to decide where the pauses should be inserted to recover the message, but with the method shown here, this information is encoded in and easily recovered from the encrypted data. Even should some other method be chosen to scramble the length information in the encoding, secrecy of the algorithm is the real key in this technique. Modifications of Ohaver's technique do exist in which the security is not based on the secrecy of the algorithm.<P>

Plato believed what we perceive is but a shadow of reality. Recent
archaeological excavations have uncovered evidence that this
belief may have been encouraged by Plato's youthful amusement with
cleverly-designed blocks.  The blocks have the curious property
that, when held with any face toward a light source, they cast
shadows of various letters, numbers, shapes, and patterns.  It is
possible for three faces incident to a corner to correspond to
three different shadow patterns.  Opposite faces, of course, cast
shadows which are mirror images of one another.

<P>
The blocks are formed by gluing together small cubes to form a
single, connected object.  As an example, the figures below show,
layer by layer, the internal structure of a block which can cast
shadows of the letters "E", "G", or "B".

<P>
Only a partial set of blocks was discovered, but the curious
scientists wouldlike to determine what combinations of shadows are
possible.  Your program, the solution to this problem, will help
them!  The program will input groups of shadow patterns, and for
each group will report whether or not a solid can be constructed
that will cast those three shadows.

`<TT>X</TT>' appears a shadow should be cast by the final solid, and where
a `<TT>-</TT>' appears, light should pass through.  For this problem, the

For this problem you will determine the output of a logic circuit
composed of one or more inputs, zero or more dual-input AND/OR
gates, and one output. The input circuits are drawn with standard
ASCII characters. Circuit paths are represented using horizontal
and vertical lines, and junctions. Horizontal lines are
represented with dash characters (ASCII code 45 decimal), vertical
lines with vertical bar characters (ASCII code 124 decimal), and
junctions with plus characters (ASCII code 43 decimal). Inputs are
represented using the capital letters A through Z, and the output
is represented by a question mark. AND and OR gates are
represented as shown in the leftmost entries in the figure below,
and their orientation will always be exactly as shown. The
location of the gate inputs and output is shown by the middle
figure below. Finally, gate inputs or its output can be inverted,
represented by a lowercase "oh" character (ASCII code 111 decimal)
at the input or output location. The figure on the right below
shows a simple but complete logic circuit.

Circuits in the input will obey the following guidelines:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>The maximum size of the circuit picture is 100 by 100
characters.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A path always travels in a straight line unless altered by a
junction.At a junction, the path can and will make a ninety degree
turn. Two junctions will not be horizontally or vertically
adjacent.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>No paths will be "broken". That is, every path character is
guaranteed to be adjacent on both sides to either another path
character of the same type, a junction, a gate input, a gate
output, a logic input, or the logic output.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Circuit paths do not cross or intersect other paths.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Gate inputs always approach horizontally from the left as shown
above. Gate outputs always leave horizontally to the right as
shown above.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Inversions may only appear immediately adjacent to a gate input
or output, and will always be preceded (in the case of an input)
or followed (in the case of an output) by at least one dash as
shown above.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The end of a logic diagram in the input is indicated by line
containing only a single asterisk in the first column. Following
this are several lines which indicate the state of the inputs in
the logic diagram.  Each of these lines is a string of twenty-six
`<TT>0</TT>' (zero) or `<TT>1</TT>' characters, with the first position representing
the state of input A, the second position representing the state
of input B, etc.  Note that input values which are not actually
used in the circuit may simply be ignored. The list of input
states is terminated by a line containing only a single asterisk
character in the first column.

<P>
Following the asterisk which terminates the list of input states
is another circuit diagram followed by a list of input states,
which is then followed by another circuit diagram and list of
input states, and so on until the end of the file.  The file will
always contain at least one circuit and one set of inputs for that
circuit.

<P>
The program is to report the value of the output (`<TT>0</TT>' or `<TT>1</TT>') of each
logic circuit, one value per line, for each set of input values in
the list which follows the circuit.  The list of outputs for each
circuit should be separated by a single blank line.

<P>A cyclic number is an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> digits in length which, when multiplied by any integer from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>, yields a ``cycle" of the digits of the original number.

<P>The game of Set is played with a deck of eighty-one cards, each having the following four characteristics:<P><UL><LI>Symbol: diamonds, ovals, or squiggles </LI><LI>Count: 1, 2, or 3 symbols </LI><LI>Color: red, green, or purple </LI><LI>Shading: outlined, filled, or striped </LI></UL><P>The cards are shuffled and a tableau of twelve cards is laid out.

Play continues in this manner until all cards have been used. The winner is the player with the most sets.<P>A <EM>set</EM> is a collection of three cards in which each characteristic is either the same on all three cards or different on all three cards.

<P>In a wireless network with multiple transmitters sending on the same frequencies, it is often a requirement that signals don't overlap, or at least that they don't conflict. One way of accomplishing this is to restrict a transmitter's coverage area. This problem uses a shielded transmitter that only broadcasts in a semicircle.</P><P>A transmitter <I>T</I> is located somewhere on a 1,000 square meter grid. It broadcasts in a semicircular area of radius <I>r</I>. The transmitter may be rotated any amount, but not moved. Given <I>N</I> points anywhere on the grid, compute the maximum number of points that can be simultaneously reached by the transmitter's signal. Figure 1 shows the same data points with two different transmitter rotations.</P><CENTER><img border="0" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/22/p2290a.gif width="464" height="175"></CENTER><P>All input coordinates are integers (0-1000). The radius is a positive real number greater than 0. Points on the boundary of a semicircle are considered within that semicircle. There are 1-150 unique points to examine per transmitter. No points are at the same location as the transmitter.</P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Input consists of information for one or more independent transmitter problems.

The end of the input is signalled by a line with a negative radius; the (x,y) values will be present but indeterminate.

<P>Weird Wally's Wireless Widgets, Inc. manufactures an eclectic assortment of small, wireless, network capable devices, ranging from dog collars, to pencils, to fishing bobbers. All these devices have very small memories. Encryption algorithms like Rijndael, the candidate for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are demonstrably secure but they don't fit in such a tiny memory. In order to provide some security for transmissions to and from the devices, WWWW uses the following algorithm, which you are to implement.</P><P>Encrypting a message requires three integer keys, <I>k<SUB>1</SUB></I>, <I>k<SUB>2</SUB></I>, and <I>k<SUB>3</SUB></I>. The letters [a-i] form one group, [j-r] a second group, and everything else ([s-z] and underscore) the third group. Within each group the letters are rotated <I>left</I> by <I>k<SUB>i</SUB></I> positions in the message. Each group is rotated independently of the other two. Decrypting the message means doing a <I>right</I> rotation by <I>k<SUB>i</SUB></I> positions within each group.</P><P>Consider the message <TT>the_quick_brown_fox</TT> encrypted with <I>k<SUB>i</SUB></I> values of 2, 3 and 1.

<P>How far can you make a stack of cards overhang a table? If you have one card, 
you can create a maximum overhang of half a card length. (We're assuming that 
the cards must be perpendicular to the table.) With two cards you can make the 
top card overhang the bottom one by half a card length, and the bottom one 
overhang the table by a third of a card length, for a total maximum overhang of 
1/2 <TT>+</TT> 1/3 <TT>=</TT> 5/6 card lengths. In general you can make <I>n</I> 
cards overhang by 1/2 <TT>+</TT> 1/3 <TT>+</TT> 1/4 <TT>+</TT> ... <TT>+</TT> 
1/(<I>n</I> <TT>+</TT> 1) card lengths, where the top card overhangs the second 
by 1/2, the second overhangs tha third by 1/3, the third overhangs the fourth by 
1/4, etc., and the bottom card overhangs the table by 1/(<I>n</I> <TT>+</TT> 1). 
This is illustrated in the figure below.</P>

A human sees the black ink but not the polymer, and a machine sees the polymer but not the black ink. The only problem is that the polymer is much more expensive than the ink, so DoubleVision wants to use as little of it as possible. They have discovered that with many fonts, each symbol can be uniquely identified by at most two pixels. By only adding the polymer to one or two pixels per symbol, they drastically lower costs while still ensuring 100% accuracy in their scanners. The font shown above has this property; pixels that uniquely identify each letter are highlighted with '<TT>#</TT>'.

<P>
In the game of duplicate bridge, twelve pairs of players play 
exactly the same deal of cards.  Each pair plays against another 
pair not chosen from the original 12 (so there are 24 pairs 
altogether). To eliminate the luck involved in randomly 
distributing cards, the scoring system compares the results of 
the 12 original pairs. A numerical score is computed from the 
rules of the game, which may be positive or negative (or rarely, 
0). A pair then receives 1 point for every other pair with a 
worse score and 1/2 point for every other pair with an equal score. 
The total of these points is the pair's score. 

<P>

<P>
Suppose the 12 teams' names and scores, in order, are the ones in
the Sample Input below.

<P>
The Smith team receives a total of 5 1/2  points (1/2 each for tying 
the Haskin team, the Most team, and the Franklin team, and 1 each 
for beating teams Williams, Kelso, Lawler, and Boston).  The 
Binfield team would receive a top score of 11 for beating every 
other team, while the Boston team would receive a ``bottom" score 
of 0 for neither tying nor beating any other team.  The sample 
input will always consist of 12 lines of a team name and score.  
The team name will be no longer than 10 characters.

Output should consist of two columns.  The first column should 
denote the scores of the top six teams, in order of finish.  The 
second column should denote the second six teams, in order of 
finish.  Names should be left-aligned; scores should be decimal

The town of Fooble is illuminated at night by a series of lights. 
Each light illuminates a circular area of a specified size.  Due 
to recent energy conservation laws, the lights cannot be left on 
all the time.  Therefore all the lights in town are designed to 
be on for a fixed number of time units and then turned off for 
the same time period.  This cycle repeats forever (i.e. light is 
on, light is off, light is on, light is off...). 

<P>
There are two types of lights used in the town.  Type A lights 
that are on and then off, and type B lights that are off and then 
on.  For example, a type A light with a duty cycle of 10 is on 
for 10 time units, off for 10, on for 10, off for 10 and so on.  
A type B light, with the same duty cycle, would be off for 10 
time units, on for 10, off for 10, and so on.  

<P>
The Fooble people are a funny lot.  They only travel at night and 
will only travel from one light to another.  It always takes a 
Foobie exactly one time unit to travel from one light to another, 
regardless of the distance between the lights.  Foobies are 
deathly afraid of the dark so they never walk from one light to 
another unless the entire area between the lights is illuminated.  
They are perfectly happy to leave a light that is currently off, 
provided that some light (or lights) are currently illuminating 
the entire area they wish to travel.  Foobies are willing to wait 
at a light that has been turned off and is in the dark, in the 
hope that some light (perhaps the one they are waiting at) will 
turn on and illuminate the area they wish to travel.  Points of 
tangency for illuminated circles are considered to be lit.

<P>
The town has prepared a listing of light information for its 
residents.  The listing includes the number, model, location, 
duty cycle, and radius of the area illuminated for each light in 
town.  The lights are numbered starting at 0 and their locations 
are given in terms of nonnegative integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> values.  All 
distances are in Fooble units.  Foobies work exclusively with 
nonnegative integer values.  The first line in an individual 
example specifies the total number of lights in town, and the 
lights are always listed in numerical order. The last line of an example
specifies the origin and destination lights of the travel.   

<P>
The first line of the sample data is the number of examples 
to be solved.

<P>
You are to write a program that given a light list, and the 
number of a light where a Foobie will start from and the number 
of the light they wish to travel to, will print out a quickest 
path (in terms of time units) that the Foobie must travel to 
reach their destination.  Travel directions are vertical, 
horizontal, and diagonal.  The program must output the sequence 
of moves the Foobie will take and will also indicate when the 
Foobie must wait before moving on to the next light.  Your 
program must be able to indicate if the Foobie cannot make the 
desired trip. 

<P>
Examples should be separated by a blank line.  A 
title line specifying the example number and using the verbiage 
given below should also be included.  Finally, there should be a 
blank line after each example title line.

<P>
A group of colonists has landed on an uncharted island, looking for that special place to stop and settle.
Unfortunately, there are already natives on the island, and now it's a race to see who will be able to survive.
In order to settle, a group must find food.

<P>
The settlers have not learned the arts of agriculture yet, so they will invariably eat all the food and have to move on.
If any groups encounter each other, they will fight to the death, since resources are scarce.
Your job is to determine who will be alive or dead at the end of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> turns and where they are on the island.

<P>
The island is a rectangular <!-- MATH
 $A \times B$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>B</I></SPAN> matrix.
Each square is either water, fields, or mountains.
Settlers or native groups can only be located on fields (they can neither swim nor climb).
Wheat grows in certain locations on the fields and is the only source of food for the groups.

<P>
Each group is assigned an identifier and has a certain number of people in it.
During each year (or turn), the surviving groups (those with one or more people alive) will perform an action.
The group with the lowest identifier goes first, followed by the next lowest, until all groups have had their ``turn."

<P>
A group can only do one of the actions listed below.
To determine which action a group does, they try to do the first action.
If unable to do that action, the group will try the second action, and so forth until it finds an action that it can perform.

<P>
Note that a group will always be able to do one of the following actions each turn:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>If a group is adjacent to another group, they will attack (in the case of multiple adjacent tribes, the tribe will attack the first tribe it finds in a clockwise search starting at the northern square).
</LI>
<LI>If a group is adjacent to wheat, then the group will eat it and not move (if multiple wheat terrain squares are adjacent to the group, the wheat eaten will be the first encountered using a clockwise search starting from the terrain square to the north of the group).

<P>
The wheat eaten will be reduced by the number of people in the group.
If there are more people in the group than wheat, the next group of wheat in the clockwise search pattern will be eaten until either there is no more wheat in an adjacent terrain square or the total number of wheat units consumed equals the size of the group.
Once wheat is completely consumed, the square that the wheat was in should be considered as a normal field.
</LI>
<LI>If a group was not adjacent to any wheat at the beginning of their turn, the group will search for food by moving one square to the North, East, South, or West (see below for moving requirements).
If the group is unable to move, it will stay in its current location.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
At the end of each group's turn, the number of people in the group and anything they might have encountered is recalculated based on:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>If the group ate this turn, the group will grow by 33% (rounded up) of the people that were able to eat. 5% (rounded up) of the people that did not eat will die due to starvation.
</LI>
<LI>If the group attacked another tribe, the group will kill an amount of people equal to its 'strength.'
A group's strength is equal to 50% (rounded up) of its population.
Because they are not eating while fighting, 10% (rounded up) of the group will die after the fighting is finished.
Note that only the group attacking does damage; the other group will have to wait until its turn to retaliate, if it is able to.
</LI>
<LI>If a group moved to another square, 10% (rounded up) of the people in the group will die due to starvation and the rigors of travel.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<B>NOTE:</B> When rounding, round the amount that will be added or subtracted from the group. Only use the cardinal points (<TT>N</TT>,<TT>S</TT>,<TT>E</TT>,<TT>W</TT>) when determining if a group is adjacent to something.

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<B>Movement</B>: Whether a group is comprised of settlers or natives, moving on the island is highly ritualized.
Each group follows a set of rules to determine which direction to move in order to find the perfect place to stop and make a (brief) home:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Each group remembers where it has been and determines which direction to go based on a point system. Points will be recalculated each turn as follows:

<UL>
<LI>Assign each area adjacent to the group (considering cardinal directions only) a number of points equal to the number of times the group has entered that square.
Note that if a group moves to and stays in a single square for multiple turns, it has only entered the square once.
Starting the simulation in a particular terrain square also counts as entering that square once.
</LI>
<LI>Groups loath to turn around and go back the way they came, thus the last visited area shall be worth double the points calculated from above.
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>The group will move in the direction with the lowest points.
In case of a tie, the group will give priority to the tied direction appearing first in this list: North, East, South, West.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><EM>Since water and mountains are impassible, do not consider moving to terrain squares containing them!</EM>

<P>``Uncle Jacques, " you ask, ``What's for dinner?"<P>``Ask me again in 10 minutes," Uncle Jacques replies, eyeing the weary-looking frog sitting on the shoulder of Interstate 10, in front of your dilapidated shack.<P><P><BR>You notice the potential roadkill as it begins its journey across the vehicle-laden road. You want to know if you should begin boiling a pot of water in anticipation of frog legs for dinner or warm up the leftover possum. You fire up your Swamp 'Puter XL2 and quickly write a program to determine if it is possible for the frog to make it across the road or if it will be hit by a vehicle.<P>Examining the patch of road in front of your shack, you notice the lanes and shoulders resemble a 10 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>x</TT></SPAN> 10 grid of squares (shown below). You also notice that the way the frog and the vehicles are moving can be described in ``turns". To determine if the frog makes it across the road, you quickly devise a set of rules:<P><OL><LI>At the onset of a run, the frog can start in any square on row 0 (the starting shoulder). </LI><LI>At the onset of a run, each vehicle will occupy a square in any column, but only in rows 1-8 (the lanes). </LI><LI>Each turn will consist of two steps:<UL><LI>First, the frog will always remain in the same column and move one row down, towards row 9, his destination (he's not the smartest frog in the world). </LI><LI>Next, all the vehicles move (at the same time), <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> squares left or right, depending on which row (lane) they are in, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> is their speed (given in the input). To simulate more approaching vehicles, if a vehicle moves off the grid, it instead ``wraps around" and appears from the opposite side. Ex: In the grid below, if a vehicle would move to occupy column -1, it would instead occupy column 9 (column -2 would instead occupy column 8, etc.). Also, if a vehicle would move to occupy column 10, it would instead occupy column 0 (column 11 would instead occupy column 1, etc.).<P><PRE>

When trying to avoid conflict and maintain peace, a good strategy is to remove the elements that cause the most trouble.
IBM is using its Deep Blue machine to try to study this strategy by modeling it with a game of chess.
IBM needs a program to find the minimum number of chess pieces that must be removed from a chessboard in order for none of the pieces to be attacking each other.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
All pieces will have the standard attack movements for that chess piece.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
King  - Can attack the adjacent space in any direction.  Up, down, left, right and diagonally.

<P>
Queen - Can attack any number of spaces in any direction.  Up, down, left, right and diagonally.

<P>
Bishop - Can attack any number of spaces diagonally.

<P>
Rook - Can attack any number of spaces up, down, left, or right but not diagonally.

<P>
Pawns - There won't be any pawns.

<P>
Knight - Can attack with their usual 'L' shaped movement.  Up twice and right once, up once and left twice, etc<SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN>

<P>Boudreaux and Thibodaux have just seen the Matrix, and are arguing whether or not it would actually be possible to dodge bullets if you moved fast enough. Boudreaux is used to hunting nutria with buckshot, and maintains that most bullet spreads should make it impossible to dodge all the bullets. Thibodaux is still doing kung-fu in his head, and is sure that if you could move fast enough it would be possible to dodge the bullets. Boudreaux is getting fed up, and is about ready to prove his point with some empirical testing.

<P>Remember those wacky number puzzles you used to win at birthday parties as a kid? Well, they're back, but this time with a digital twist.

And why should games be any different?<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="323" HEIGHT="196" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2310.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p2310.eps}"></DIV><P>With this in mind Wiltin' Badley has decided to release a 21st Century version of this old puzzle favorite and call it <EM>Missing Piece 2001</EM>. Since this is a modern version of the game, it will be accompanied with a software supplement to give the player an idea of the skill level necessary to solve the puzzle. The software supplement will allow the player to enter in the initial board configuration along with the expected final board configuration, and the software will tell the player whether it is solvable within a certain number of moves.

Therefore, you are to design this software to allow the user to enter the dimensions of the game board, the desired number of moves in which the puzzle is to be solved, the initial board configuration, and the final board configuration. This user input will take into account different game board sizes (different-sized game boards sold separately, for a nominal fee of course), different number of moves necessary to solve the puzzle (so the player can tell if the puzzle is solvable given his/her skill level), as well as any solution set the player may want to try.<P><P><BR><B>Game Piece Movement</B><P><P><BR>A valid move consists of moving a game piece (number) which is adjacent to the <EM>missing piece</EM> (`X') in the direction of the <EM>missing piece</EM>.

<P>This problem deals with finding the longest common subsequence between a given set of sequences. A subsequence of a given sequence is simply the given sequence with some elements, possibly none, removed. For example, (2,4,1,5,7) is a subsequence of (9,2,3,4,1,4,5,12,7,10,9). Every sequence is a subsequence of itself; the empty sequence is a subsequence of every sequence. Given two sequences A and B, we say that X is a common subsequence of A and B, if C is subsequence of both A and B. Given three sequences A, B, and C, we say that X is a common subsequence of A, B and C, if X is a subsequence of A, is a subsequence of B, and is a subsequence of C. The longest common subsequence of a given trio of sequences is the maximum-length common subsequence of the three sequences.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input file will consist of several problem instances.

<P>
A well-known problem is to determine the maximum number of queens that 
can be placed on a chess-board without any of them attacking any other. 
In this problem you have to answer this question for a new type of 
chess piece, the peasant. 

<P>
Unlike the other pieces, a peasant's valid moves 
change from time to time. You will thus be given the valid moves as 
part of the input. Each valid move consists of a pair <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>R</I>, <I>C</I>)</SPAN>, indicating 
that the peasant may move <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN> rows forward and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> columns right, provided 
that this does not take the piece off the board. Negative values 
indicate motion in the opposite direction. For example, a knight in chess 
would be described by the valid moves (+/-1, +/-2) and (+/-2, +/-1). Like a 
knight, a peasant moves directly to the target square, even if there 
are other pieces in between.

<P>
The input will consist of multiple cases. 
Each cases starts with a line containing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>, the width and height of the 
board. The second line contains <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>, the number of valid moves that a 
peasant has. The next <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> lines describe the valid moves for this test case. 
Each line consists of two space-separated integers, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>, which have 
the meanings described above. The last test case is followed by a line 
containing only a `<TT>0</TT>'.

BIGIANT UNIVERSITY reports payroll expenses to the administration
giving totals by department within school.  For instance, within
the school of arts and sciences totals would be accumulated for
the Psychology, Economics, Philosophy, and other departments.

<P>
Your task is to write a program, which will accumulate total
payroll expenses by department within school and report them.
You will not list individual pay amounts, only the totals by
department and by school.

<P>
You must report the total number of employees and total pay
amount by department and by school, and give a grand total for
the entire university.  The data from which these totals are to
be calculated are arranged in order by department within school.
This process is known as "control break processing" because a
control break is said to have occurred each time a department or
school changes.

<P>The Cairo Metro Authority has asked you to write a program to compute the average time necessary to travel between any two metro stations in Cairo. You are given the number of stations; for every pair of stations that are directly adjacent, you are given the average time needed to travel from one station to the other.

<P>
It's 3000 years ago. The Pharao's pyramid has just been finished, and now the interior needs to be worked
on. However, it's pitch dark inside, and the problem of providing light for the workers has to be solved.

<P>
Electric light hasn't been invented yet, and lighting a fire inside the pyramid isn't a good solution either,
because the interior should stay clean of smoke and ash. Therefore, the senior architect's proposal is to use
mirrors to redirect sunlight from the entrance to the construction sites. From time to time, after work had
been finished at one place, the mirrors will have to be realigned in order to direct the light to another place.

<P>
For this task of realigning the mirrors, an algorithm is needed. The input will be a two-dimensional map of
one floor. The map displays the origin and the desired destination of the light, all obstacles and all mirrors,
and the current path of the light. The output should be another map in which the mirrors are realigned
appropriately (if neccessary) so that the light reaches the destination.

<P>
As the Pharao's chief software engineer, it's your job to design this algorithm. The ``computers"  - a group
of mathematically trained workers - will execute the program manually later. (Now you know why it took
decades to build the pyramids.)

Adam and Eve enter this year's ACM International Collegiate Programming
Contest. Last night, they played the Calendar Game, in celebration of
this contest. This game consists of the dates from January 1, 1900 to
November 4, 2001, the contest day. The game starts by randomly
choosing a date from this interval. Then, the players, Adam and Eve,
make moves in their turn with Adam moving first: Adam, Eve, Adam, Eve,
etc. There is only one rule for moves and it is simple: from a current
date, a player in his/her turn can move either to the next calendar
date or the same day of the next month. When the next month does not
have the same day, the player moves only to the next calendar date.
For example, from December 19, 1924, you can move either to December
20, 1924, the next calendar date, or January 19, 1925, the same day of
the next month. From January 31 2001, however, you can move only to
February 1, 2001, because February 31, 2001 is invalid.
</p>
<p> A player wins the game when he/she exactly reaches the date of
November 4, 2001. If a player moves to a date after November 4, 2001,
he/she looses the game.
</p>
<p>
Write a program that decides whether, given an
initial date, Adam, the first mover, has a winning strategy.
</p>
<p>
For this
game, you need to identify leap years, where February has 29 days. In
the Gregorian calendar, leap years occur in years exactly divisible by
four. So, 1993, 1994, and 1995 are not leap years, while 1992 and 1996
are leap years. Additionally, the years ending with 00 are leap years
only if they are divisible by 400. So, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, and
2200 are not leap years, while 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years.

There is a pile of <i>n </i>wooden sticks. The length and weight of
each stick are known in advance. The sticks are
to be processed by a woodworking machine in one by one fashion. It
needs some time, called setup time, for
the machine to prepare processing a stick. The setup times are
associated with cleaning operations and
changing tools and shapes in the machine. The setup times of the
woodworking machine are given as follows:
<ul>
<li>The setup time for the first wooden
stick is 1 minute.</li>
<li>
Right after processing a stick of length <i>l </i>and weight <i>w
</i>, the machine will need no setup time for a stick
of length <i>l</i>' and weight <i>w</i>' if <i>l </i><=<i>l</i>'
and <i>w </i><=<i>w</i>' . </li>
</ul>
Otherwise, it will need 1 minute for setup.<br>
You are to find the minimum setup time to process a given pile of <i>n
</i>wooden sticks. For example, if you have
five sticks whose pairs of length and weight are (4,9), (5,2), (2,1), (3,5),
and (1,4) then the minimum setup
time should be 2 minutes since there is a sequence of pairs (1,4),
(3,5), (4,9), (2,1), (5,2).
<h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a

</font></h2>
The input consists of <i>T</i> test cases. The number of test cases (<i>T</i>) is given in the first line of the input file. Each
test case consists of two lines: The first line has an integer <i>n</i>,
1&lt;=<i>n&lt;=</i>5000, that represents the number of
wooden sticks in the test case, and the second line contains 2<i>n </i>positive
integers <i>l<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>w<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>l<sub>2</sub></i>,
<i>w<sub>2</sub></i>, ..., <i>l<sub>n</sub></i>, <i>w<sub>n</sub></i>,
each of magnitude at most 10000, where <i>l<sub>i</sub> </i>and <i>w<sub>i</sub>
</i>are the length and weight of the <i>i </i>th wooden stick,
respectively. The 2<i>n </i>integers are delimited by one or
more spaces.

Consider polynomials whose coefficients are 0 and 1. Addition of two
polynomials is achieved by 'adding' the
coefficients for the corresponding powers in the polynomials. The
addition of coefficients is performed by
addition modulo 2, i.e., (0 + 0) mod 2 = 0, (0 + 1) mod 2 = 1, (1 + 0)
mod 2 = 1, and (1 + 1) mod 2 = 0. Hence,
it is the same as the exclusive-or operation.
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">(x<sup>6</sup>
+ x<sup>4</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + x + 1) + (x<sup>7</sup> + x + 1) = x<sup>7</sup>
+ x<sup>6</sup> + x<sup>4</sup> + x<sup>2</sup></span><br>
</div>
<br>
Subtraction of two polynomials is done similarly. Since subtraction of
coefficients is performed by subtraction
modulo 2 which is also the exclusive-or operation, subtraction of
polynomials is identical to addition of
polynomials.
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">(x<sup>6</sup>
+ x<sup>4</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + x + 1) - (x<sup>7</sup> + x + 1) = x<sup>7</sup>
+ x<sup>6</sup> + x<sup>4</sup> + x<sup>2<br>
<br>
</sup></span></div>
Multiplication of two polynomials is done in the usual way (of course,
addition of coefficients is performed by
addition modulo 2).<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">(x<sup>6</sup>
+ x<sup>4</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + x + 1)(x<sup>7</sup> + x + 1) = x<sup>13</sup>
+ x<sup>11</sup> + x<sup>9</sup> + x<sup>8</sup> + x<sup>6</sup> + x<sup>5</sup>
+ x<sup>4</sup> + x<sup>3</sup> + 1<br>
<br>
</span></div>
Multiplication of two polynomials f(x) and g(x) modulo a polynomial
h(x) is the remainder of f(x)g(x) divided
by h(x).
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">(x<sup>6</sup>
+ x<sup>4</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + x + 1)(x<sup>7</sup> + x + 1) modulo
(x<sup>8</sup> + x<sup>4</sup> + x<sup>3</sup> + x + 1) = x<sup>7</sup>
+ x<sup>6</sup> + 1<br>
<br>
</span></div>
The largest exponent of a polynomial is called its degree. For example,
the degree of <span style="font-family: monospace;">x</span><sup
 style="font-family: monospace;">7</sup><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"> + x</span><sup
 style="font-family: monospace;">6</sup><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"> + 1</span> is 7.<br>
Given three polynomials f(x), g(x), and h(x), you are to write a
program that computes f(x)g(x) modulo h(x).<br>
We assume that the degrees of both f(x) and g(x) are less than the
degree of h(x). The degree of a polynomial
is less than 1000.<br>
<br>
Since coefficients of a polynomial are 0 or 1, a polynomial can be
represented by d+1 and a bit string of
length d+1, where d is the degree of the polynomial and the bit string
represents the coefficients of the
polynomial. For example, <span style="font-family: monospace;">x<sup>7</sup>
+ x<sup>6</sup> + 1</span> can be represented by<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">8
1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1.</span></div>
<h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a

</h2>
The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases (T) is
given in the first line of the input file. Each
test case consists of three lines that contain three polynomials f(x),
g(x), and h(x), one per line. Each
polynomial is represented as described above.

It is well known that a human gene can be considered as a sequence,
consisting of four nucleotides, which are
simply denoted by four letters, A, C, G, and T. Biologists have been
interested in identifying human genes
and determining their functions, because these can be used to diagnose
human diseases and to design new
drugs for them.<br>
<br>
A human gene can be identified through a series of time-consuming
biological experiments, often with the
help of computer programs. Once a sequence of a gene is obtained, the
next job is to determine its function.
One of the methods for biologists to use in determining the function of
a new gene sequence that they have
just identified is to search a database with the new gene as a query.
The database to be searched stores many
gene sequences and their functions - many researchers have been
submitting their genes and functions to the<br>
database and the database is freely accessible through the Internet.<br>
<br>
A database search will return a list of gene sequences from the
database that are similar to the query gene.
Biologists assume that sequence similarity often implies functional
similarity. So, the function of the new
gene might be one of the functions that the genes from the list have.
To exactly determine which one is the
right one another series of biological experiments will be needed.<br>
<br>
Your job is to make a program that compares two genes and determines
their similarity as explained below.<br>
Your program may be used as a part of the database search if you can
provide an efficient one.<br>
<br>
Given two genes AGTGATG and GTTAG, how similar are they? One of the
methods to measure the similarity
of two genes is called alignment. In an alignment, spaces are inserted,
if necessary, in appropriate positions of
the genes to make them equally long and score the resulting genes
according to a scoring matrix.<br>
<br>
For example, one space is inserted into AGTGATG to result in AGTGAT-G,
and three spaces are inserted into
GTTAG to result in -GT--TAG. A space is denoted by a minus sign
(-). The two genes are now of equal
length. These two strings are aligned:<br>
<div style="text-align: center; font-family: monospace;">AGTGAT-G<br>
-GT--TAG<br>
</div>
In this alignment, there are four matches, namely, G in the second
position, T in the third, T in the sixth, and G
in the eighth. Each pair of aligned characters is assigned a score
according to the following scoring matrix.<br>
<br>

* denotes that a space-space match is not allowed. The score of the

This alignment gives a score of (-3)+5+5+(-2)+5+(-1) +5=14. So, this
one is better than the previous one. As
a matter of fact, this one is optimal since no other alignment can have
a higher score. So, it is said that the
similarity of the two genes is 14.<br>

The famous ACM (Advanced Computer Maker) Company has rented a floor of
a building whose shape is in
the following figure.
<center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2326a.gif></center>
The floor has 200 rooms each on the north side and south side along the
corridor. Recently the Company
made a plan to reform its system. The reform includes moving a lot of
tables between rooms. Because the
corridor is narrow and all the tables are big, only one table can pass
through the corridor. Some plan is needed
to make the moving efficient. The manager figured out the following
plan: Moving a table from a room to
another room can be done within 10 minutes. When moving a table from
room <i>i </i>to room <i>j</i>, the part of the
corridor between the front of room <i>i </i>and the front of room <i>j
</i>is used. So, during each 10 minutes, several
moving between two rooms not sharing the same part of the corridor will
be done simultaneously. To make it
clear the manager illustrated the possible cases and impossible cases
of simultaneous moving.<br>

We have a map for farming land in a country. The whole farming land of
the country is divided into a set of
disjoint farming regions. Each farmer owns only one farming region in
this country. There is a boundary fence
between two neighboring farming regions. The farmland map for this
country can be represented in a plane
graph. The following Figure-1 shows one example.<br>
<br>
<center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2327a.gif></center>
<div style="text-align: left;">There are two types of edges, boundary
edge and non-boundary edge. All edges of G(V,E) except (v8, v6) and
(v11, v10) are boundary edges which are between two neighboring farming
regions. The "proper farming
region" in a Farmland graph is a closed region bounded by a simple
cycle and it should not contain any
vertices or edges inside. In this figure, the polygon &lt;v1,v9,v8,v7
&gt; is a proper farming region, and the region &lt;
v2, v1, v7, v8 , v2, v5, v4, v3 &gt; is not a proper farming region
since its boundary cycle is not simple.<br>
<br>
We assume that the farmland graph G(V,E) is a simple connected graph,
which does not allow self-loops
(Figure-2 (a)) and parallel edges (Figure-2 (b)). Also in Farmland
graph G(V,E), we do not consider the outer
face of G(V,E). You can see that there are 2 proper farming regions in
G(V,E) shown in Figure-1, namely
&lt;v1,v9,v8,v7&gt;
and &lt;v2,v3,v4,v5&gt;, since there are no vertices or edges inside.
But the polygon&lt;v1,v7,v8,v2&gt; is not
a proper farming region since vertex v3, v4, and v5 are located in that
region. Similarly, the region
&lt;v9,v11,v12,v8&gt; is not a proper region because a vertex v10 is
inside the region. A degenerate polygon &lt;v6, v8&gt;
is not a proper region because it has no valid area inside.<br>
<center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2327a.gif></center>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br>
There are other assumptions for input farmland graph data.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. There is at least one proper farming
region.<br>
2. The position of each vertex in Farmland graph is distinct.<br>
3. There is no edge crossing, which means the graph G(V,E) is a plane
graph.<br>
4. Farmland graph G(V,E) is simple and connected.<br>
</div>
<br>
Let us define the "size" of proper farming region. The size of proper
farming region is the number of boundary
edges of that region. For example, the size of the proper farming
region &lt;v2,v3,v4,v5 &gt; is 4.
The problem is to find the number of proper regions that have a
specified size. If you are requested to find the
number of proper regions with size of 4 in the graph given in Figure-1,
you must answer that there are 2
proper regions whose sizes are 4 because farming regions &lt;
v1,v9,v8,v7 &gt; and &lt;v2,v3,v4,v5 &gt; are proper regions
and their sizes are 4. If there are no such regions, then you have to
print 0.</div>

The&nbsp; left&nbsp; figure below&nbsp; shows a complete&nbsp; 3x3 grid
made with&nbsp; 2x(3x4) (=24) matchsticks. The&nbsp; lengths of
all&nbsp; matchsticks are one. You can find many squares of different
sizes in the grid. The size of a square is the length&nbsp; of its
side. In the grid shown in the left figure, there are 9 squares of size
one, 4 squares of size two, and 1&nbsp; square of size three.<br>
<br>
Each matchstick of the complete grid is identified with a unique number
which is assigned from left to right
and from top to bottom as shown in the left figure. If you take some
matchsticks out from the complete grid,
then some squares in the grid will be destroyed, which results in an
incomplete 3&times;3 grid. The right figure
illustrates an incomplete 3&times;3 grid after removing three
matchsticks numbered with 12, 17 and 23. This
removal destroys 5 squares of size one, 3 squares of size two, and 1
square of size three. Consequently, the
incomplete grid does not have squares of size three, but still has 4
squares of size one and 1 square of size two.
<center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2328a.gif></center>

As input, you are given a (complete or incomplete) <i>n </i>&times; <i>n

number of matchsticks taken
out to destroy <b>all </b>the squares existing in the input <i>n </i>&times;
<i>n </i>grid.
<h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a

The input consists of <i>T </i>test cases. The number of test cases (<i>T</i>)
is given in the first line of the input file.
Each test case consists of two lines: The first line contains a natural
number <i>n </i>, not greater than 5, which
implies you are given a (complete or incomplete) <i>n </i>&times; <i>n

nonnegative integer <i>k </i>, the number of matchsticks that are
missing from the complete <i>n </i>&times; <i>n </i>grid, followed
by

equal to zero, then the input grid is a complete <i>n </i>&times; <i>n</i>

Being well known for its highly innovative products, Merck would definitely be a good
target for industrial
espionage. To protect its brand-new research and development facility the company has
installed the latest
system of surveillance robots patrolling the area. These robots move along the walls
of the facility and
report suspicious observations to the central security office. The only flaw in the
system a competitor's
agent could find is the fact that the robots radio their movements unencrypted.
Not being able to find out
more, the agent wants to use that information to calculate the exact size of the
area occupied by the new
facility. It is public knowledge that all the corners of the building are situated
on a rectangular grid and that
only straight walls are used. Figure 1 shows the course of a robot around an example area.

You are hired to write a program that calculates the area occupied by the new facility
from the movements
of a robot along its walls. You can assume that this area is a polygon with corners
on a rectangular grid.
However, your boss insists that you use a formula he is so proud to have found
somewhere. The formula
relates the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>I</I></SPAN> of grid points inside the polygon, the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN> of grid
points on the edges, and the
total area <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> of the polygon. Unfortunately, you have lost the sheet on which he
had written down that simple
formula for you, so your first task is to find the formula yourself.

Such a pair means that the robot moves on to a grid point <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>dx</I></SPAN> units to the right
and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>dy</I></SPAN> units upwards on the grid (with respect to the current position).

<P>
You can assume that the curve along which the robot moves is closed and that it
does not intersect or
even touch itself except for the start and end points. The robot moves anti-clockwise
around the building,
so the area to be calculated lies to the left of the curve. It is known in advance
that the whole polygon would
fit into a square on the grid with a side length of 100 units.

After many years of development, Merck has finally discovered a simple model which helps
with computer
aided drug design. Different chemical substances are viewed as two-dimensional
``puzzle" pieces which
may be combined in a three-dimensional way, forming more complex structures of atoms.
Special combinations of these pieces have very special chemical properties. These
combinations which are known as
<EM>ACM (Anachronistic Cube Molecules)</EM> result from combining six individual puzzle
pieces along their edges to form a complete cube (see Figure 3).

<P>During the Second World War, the German military forces mainly used one special machine to secure their communication: the <EM>Enigma</EM> (see Figure 4). Breaking the Enigma cipher is one of the main success stories of Allied cryptanalysis and the triumph was mainly attributed to the emergence of digital computation and the genius of the people working at Bletchley Park, the secret cryptanalysis headquarters in England. The reason for this is that, while Enigma is certainly secure against pen and paper attacks, it is quite easily breakable using digital computers.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="411" HEIGHT="771" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2333a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p2333a.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"></DIV><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 4: An Enigma machine (picture source: http://www.nsa.gov/museum/enigma.html).</DIV><P>The Enigma was a rotor machine, a cipher method which was popular at that time. A rotor is an insulated disk on which electrical contacts, one for each letter of the alphabet, are placed uniformly around the periphery and on each side. An internal conduction path through the insulating material connects contacts in pairs, one on each side of the disk. An electric current entering on one side travels on an internal path through the rotor cross-section, emerging at one of the contacts on the other side (see Figure 5 for a 3D visualisation of two rotors). Figure 6 shows a schematic side view of the complete rotor system. It shows that the Enigma has three rotors <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2333a.gif ALT="$ \pi_{0}^{}$"></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2333a.gif ALT="$ \pi_{1}^{}$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2333a.gif ALT="$ \pi_{2}^{}$"></SPAN> plus an additional reflecting rotor <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2333a.gif ALT="$ \pi_{R}^{}$"></SPAN>.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="522" HEIGHT="217" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2333a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p2333b.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"></DIV><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 5: 3D view of two rotors.</DIV><P><P><P><BR><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="648" HEIGHT="217" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2333a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p2333c.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"></DIV><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 6: Side view of the Enigma's rotor system.</DIV><P>The input to Enigma is a stream of alphabetic characters without blanks.

different computing problems.
For some of them efficient algorithms are already available, these are the ``easy"
problems like sorting,
evaluating a polynomial or finding the shortest path in a graph. For the ``hard"
ones only exponential-time
algorithms are known. The <EM>traveling-salesman problem</EM> belongs to this latter group.
Given a set of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> towns
and roads between these towns, the problem is to compute the shortest path allowing
a salesman to visit each of the towns once and only once and return to the starting point.

<P>


<P>
The president of Gridland has hired you to design a program that calculates the
length of the shortest
traveling-salesman tour for the towns in the country. In Gridland, there is one
town at each of the points of
a rectangular grid. Roads run from every town in the directions North, Northwest,
West, Southwest, South,
Southeast, East, and Northeast, provided that there is a neighbouring town in
that direction. The distance
between neighbouring towns in directions NorthÂ­South or EastÂ­West is 1 unit.
The length of the roads is
measured by the Euclidean distance. For example, Figure 7 shows <!-- MATH
 $2 \times 3$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">2&#215;3</SPAN>-Gridland,
i.e., a rectangular grid
of dimensions 2 by 3. In <!-- MATH
 $2 \times 3$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">2&#215;3</SPAN>-Gridland, the shortest tour has length 6.

<P>A while ago it was quite cumbersome to create a message for the Short Message Service (SMS) on a mobile phone. This was because you only have nine keys and the alphabet has more than nine letters, so most characters could only be entered by pressing one key several times. For example, if you wanted to type ``<TT>hello</TT>" you had to press key 4 twice, key 3 twice, key 5 three times, again key 5 three times, and finally key 6 three times. This procedure is very tedious and keeps many people from using the Short Message Service.<P>This led manufacturers of mobile phones to try and find an easier way to enter text on a mobile phone. The solution they developed is called <EM>T9 text input</EM>. The ``9" in the name means that you can enter almost arbitrary words with just nine keys and without pressing them more than once per character. The idea of the solution is that you simply start typing the keys without repetition, and the software uses a built-in dictionary to look for the ``most probable" word matching the input. For example, to enter ``<TT>hello</TT>" you simply press keys 4, 3, 5, 5, and 6 once. Of course, this could also be the input for the word ``<TT>gdjjm</TT>", but since this is no sensible English word, it can safely be ignored. By ruling out all other ``improbable" solutions and only taking proper English words into account, this method can speed up writing of short messages considerably. Of course, if the word is not in the dictionary (like a name) then it has to be typed in manually using key repetition again.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="398" HEIGHT="273" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2335.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p2335.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"></DIV><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 8: The Number-keys of a mobile phone.</DIV><P>More precisely, with every character typed, the phone will show the most probable combination of characters it has found up to that point. Let us assume that the phone knows about the words ``<TT>idea</TT>" and ``<TT>hello</TT>", with ``<TT>idea</TT>" occurring more often. Pressing the keys 4, 3, 5, 5, and 6, one after the other, the phone offers you ``<TT>i</TT>", ``<TT>id</TT>", then switches to ``<TT>hel</TT>", ``<TT>hell</TT>", and finally shows ``<TT>hello</TT>".<P><P>Write an implementation of the <EM>T9 text input</EM> which offers the most probable character combination after every keystroke. The probability of a character combination is defined to be the sum of the probabilities of all words in the dictionary that begin with this character combination. For example, if the dictionary contains three words ``<TT>hell</TT>", ``<TT>hello</TT>", and ``<TT>hellfire</TT>", the probability of the character combination ``<TT>hell</TT>" is the sum of the probabilities of these words. If some combinations have the same probability, your program is to select the first one in alphabetic order. The user should also be able to type the beginning of words. For example, if the word ``<TT>hello</TT>" is in the dictionary, the user can also enter the word ``<TT>he</TT>" by pressing the keys 4 and 3 even if this word is not listed in the dictionary.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The first line contains the number of scenarios.<P>Each scenario begins with a line containing the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I></SPAN> of distinct words in the dictionary ( <SPAN CLASS="MATH">0<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2335.gif ALT="$ \le$"><I>w</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2335.gif ALT="$ \le$">1000</SPAN>).

Christiane and Matthias are playing a new game, the <EM>Number Game</EM>. The rules of the
Number Game are:

<P>
Christian and Matthias take turns in choosing integer numbers greater than or
equal to 2. The following rules restrict the set of numbers which may be chosen:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>R1</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A number which has already been chosen by one of the players or a multiple of
  such a number cannot be chosen. (A number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I></SPAN> is a <EM>multiple</EM> of a number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I></SPAN>
  can be written as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I>Â·<I>x</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> is a positive integer.)

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>R2</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A sum of two such multiples cannot be chosen either.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>R3</STRONG></DT>
<DD>For simplicity, a number which is greater than 20 cannot be chosen either. This
  enables a lot more NPCs (Non-Personal-Computers) to play this game.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The player who cannot choose any number anymore looses the Number Game.

<P>
Here is an example: Matthias starts by choosing 4. Then Christiane is not allowed to
choose 4, 8, 12,
etc. Let us assume her move is 3. Now, the numbers 3, 6, 9, etc. are excluded, too;
furthermore, numbers
like: 7 = 3 + 4, 10 = 2 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUP> . </SUP></SPAN> 3 + 4, 11 = 3 + 2 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUP> . </SUP></SPAN> 4, 13 = 3 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUP> . </SUP></SPAN> 3 + 4,
...are not available. So, in fact, the only
numbers left are 2 and 5. Matthias now says 2. Since 5 = 2 + 3 is now forbidden,
too, he wins because there is no number for Christiane's move left.

<P>
Your task is to write a program which will help to play the Number Game. In general,
i.e., without
rule <B>R3</B>, this game may go on forever. However, with rule <B>R3</B>, it is
possible to write a program that finds a strategy to win the game.

<P>


<P>
Given a game situation (a list of numbers which are not yet forbidden), your program
should output all
<EM>winning moves</EM>. A winning move is a move by which the player whose turn it is can
force a win no matter
what the other player will do. Now we define these terms more formally:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A <EM>loosing position</EM> is a position in which either

<OL>
<LI>all numbers are forbidden, or
</LI>
<LI>no winning move exists.
</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI>A <EM>winning position</EM> is a position in which a winning move exists.
</LI>
<LI>A <EM>winning move</EM> is a move after which the position is a loosing position.

</UL>

<P>People in the hidden region of the Bermuda Triangle make everything they need in triangular shapes. One day, someone decided to break the rule and bake a hexagonally shaped cake. But as usual, he has to serve the cake in triangular pieces. The pieces are equilateral triangles but in different sizes for different people. He can use as many triangles as needed to cut the cake into pieces, such that nothing remains from the cake.

The village's carpentry is located by a hill side. The carpenter's two little boys
play with a piece of wood which looks like a deformed wheel with two identical
convex polygon-shaped faces. One boy sets the wooden wheel on a slope at the
hill top and let it roll down. The other boy is to quickly place himself at
where he guesses the rolling wood would stop. Your program is to help him make
the right guess.

<P>
More formally, we consider the wooden wheel as a simple convex
polygon and we approximate the hill by a sequence of connected
line segments with decreasing slopes. The slope of the last
segment in the sequence is assumed to be zero, and the slope of
the first segment is assumed to be a positive number. Initially,
the wheel is placed on the hill such that there is at least one
point of contact between the wheel and segments. For example in
the following figure, the wheel in its initial position is drawn
in solid lines, while the final position is drawn in dashed lines.

<P>
At any instant, the wheel rotates around one of its vertices, say
P, if the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>-coordinate of its center of gravity is decreased
(note that this condition is necessary at <EM>any</EM> instant during
the motion). It can be easily shown that at any instant, there is
at most one such vertex. Rotation around P is stopped when the
wheel touches a segment. The motion continues until no vertex can
be found such that the wheel can rotate around it. At any instant,
assume that changing the position of the center of gravity in any
direction for at most <SPAN CLASS="MATH">10<SUP>-5</SUP></SPAN> units, does not affect the
stability of the wheel. Also assume that the friction between the
wheel and the surface of the hill is so high that the wheel never
slides on the surface.

inside or on the boundary of the polygon (note that the given
center of gravity is not necessarily computable from wheel's
geometric shape). Next lines of the test data will describe the
shape of the hill. The surface of the hill is approximated with a
series of line segments with decreasing slopes ending with a
horizontal line segment. For each segment, there is a line
containing length and slope of a segment (both of them are real

of this part of the input has slope zero). You can assume that the

pass its end. In the last line of the test case, there is a line
containing the x and y coordinates of the right end-point of the
first segment. All coordinates and slopes are real numbers.

<P>Tom the robocat is presented in a Robotics Exhibition for an enthusiastic audience of youngsters, placed around an <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I>&#215;<I>n</I></SPAN> field. Tom which is turned off initially is placed in some arbitrary point in the field by a volunteer from the audience. At time zero of the show, Tom is turned on by a remote control. Poor Tom is shown a holographic illusion of Jerry in a short distance such that a direct path between them is either vertical or horizontal. There may be obstacles in the field, but the illusion is always placed such that in the direct path between Tom and the illusion, there would be no obstacles. Tom tries to reach Jerry, but as soon as he gets there, the illusion changes its place and the chase goes on. Let's call each chase in one direction (up, down, left, and right), a <EM>chase trip</EM>. Each trip starts from where the last illusion was deemed and ends where the next illusion is deemed out. After a number of chase trips, the holographic illusion no more shows up, and poor Tom wonders what to do next. At this time, he is signaled that for sure, if he returns to where he started the chase, a real Jerry is sleeping and he can catch it.<P><P><BR>To simplify the problem, we can consider the field as a grid of squares. Some of the squares are occupied with obstacles. At any instant, Tom is in some unoccupied square of the grid and so is Jerry, such that the direct path between them is either horizontal or vertical. It's assumed that each time Tom is shown an illusion; he can reach it by moving only in one of the four directions, without bumping into an obstacle. Tom moves into an adjacent square of the grid by taking one and only one step.<P><P><BR>The problem is that Tom's logging mechanism is a bit fuzzy, thus the number of steps he has taken in each chase trip is logged as an interval of integers, e.g. 2 to 5 steps to the left. Now is your turn to send a program to Tom's memory to help him go back.

<P>Willy the spider used to live in the chemistry laboratory of Dr. Petro. He used to wander about the lab pipes and sometimes inside empty ones. One night while he was in a pipe, he fell asleep. The next morning, Dr. Petro came to the lab. He didn't notice Willy while opening the valve to fill the pipes with hot water. Meanwhile, Stanley the gray mouse got what was going to happen. No time to lose! Stan ran hard to reach the valve before Willy gets drawn, but... Alas! He couldn't make it!<P>Poor Willy was boiled in hot water, but his memory is still in our hearts. Though Stan tried his best, we want to write a program, in the memory of Willy, to compute the time Stan had, to rescue Willy, assuming he started to run just when the doctor opened the valve.<P>To simplify the problem, assume the pipes are all vertical cylinders with diameter 1 cm. Every pipe is open from the top and closed at the bottom. Some of the pipes are connected through special horizontal pipes named <EM>links</EM>. The links have very high flow capacity, but are so tiny that at any given time, the volume of water inside them is negligible. The water enters from top of one of the pipes with a constant rate of 0.25 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2343img1.gif ALT="$ \pi$"></SPAN> cm<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN>/sec and begins to fill the pipe from the bottom until the water reaches a link through which it flows horizontally and begins to fill the connected pipe. From elementary physics we know if two pipes are connected and the surface of the water is above the connecting link, the level of water in both pipes remains the same when we try to fill one of them. In this case the water fills each pipe with a rate equal to half of the rate of incoming water. As an example, consider the following configuration:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="604" HEIGHT="719" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2343img1.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p2343.eps}"></DIV><P>First, the lower 2 centimeters of the left pipe is filled with water at full rate, then, the lower 3 centimeters of the right pipe is filled, and after that, the upper part of the two pipes are filled in parallel at half rate. The input to your program is a configuration of pipes and links, and a target level in one of the pipes (the heavy dotted line in the above figure).

There is a fierce competition among high-school graduates in Iran
to pass the centralized nationwide university entrance
examination. Ministry of Science, Research, and Technology has set
up the Education Evaluation Organization (EEO) to take care of all
aspects of this big exam. This year the EEO managed to select some
150,000 students to enter universities out of 1.4 million high
school graduates participated in a tough 4.5 hours multiple-choice
exam. This annual event is usually preceded by a multi-billion
Rial business offering preparatory courses to enthusiastic
students. A few weeks after the big exam day, each participant
receives a score sheet, and a list of Field-Department-University
(FDU), displaying each field of study in the universities'
departments (e.g., the Software Engineering field of Computer
Engineering department at Sharif University of Technology) along
with their capacity for that year. The eligible participants
(those who have scored enough to be allowed to declare their FDU
priorities) fill out a priority indication form, and declare the
FDUs they like to enter, in the order of their preference. The EEO
processes the forms, and considering the total score, the
participant's FDU priority list, and some other selection rules,
enters the accepted participants' names in the list of each FDU,
until all capacities are exhausted. Those who are not entered in a
list are considered failed and may try again next year. Each
accepted participant's name may be entered in only one list.

<P>
One of the interesting selection rules is to persuade participants to enter
universities in the vicinity of their home towns. This is to help reduce the
number of requests for staying in the university dormitories.

<P>
The selection process is so complex and so sensitive to many, that EEO has
decided to hire the very best programmers in Iran to design a new selection
algorithm and write a completely new program for what they have been doing
for years. ACM programming contest is where these programmers can be found.

<P>
There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> students <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>N</SUB></SPAN> , and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> items <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>F</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> to
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>F</I><SUB>M</SUB></SPAN> , each representing one of the FDUs. There are also a number
of geographic regions. For each participant, the total score, the
geographic region where his/her high school diploma was awarded,
and a priority list of his/her wanted FDUs are available. For each
FDU, the geographic region where the corresponding university is
located, and its capacity for that year is recorded.

<P>
Write a program to compute the list of accepted students with the
FDU they can enter to, given the above list of input data. Your
program must abide with the following rules:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>(Local student selection rule) Suppose two students A and B
have both selected F in their priority lists and F is in region R.
Also suppose that score of A is greater than B's score.  Then, if
B is from region R (local) and A is from other regions
(non-local), and B's score is greater than 70% of A's score, then
B has priority over A to enter F. In <EM>all</EM> other cases A has
priority over B to enter F.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>(Fairness rule) Students should be treated according to their
priority list of FDUs. That is, an accepted student will be
accepted to the first possible FDU he/she can enter.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Note: We assume that scores are all different integer values.

Jashim runs a juice shop near the university campus. Students buy their weekly juice stock from his shop. Every morning juice producers bring their supplies to his shop in jars of two different sizes. Each of these jars can contain a particular volume (expressed in liter) of juice and has marks to indicate that volume. The suppliers have jars of different volumes and jars given today are not necessarily the same in volume as those given yesterday. Had the shop been at some other location, Jashim wouldn't have faced any difficulty with the jars, but the students like to buy the smallest volume of juice Jashim is ready to provide.  So, every morning, Jashim has to undergo a long process of making the smallest volume of juice possible with the given jars.

<P>
Jashim doesn't have any measuring pot for direct measurement of volume. Rather he uses a very large barrel (of almost infinite capacity) for this purpose. He takes one of the supplied jars and either pours all the juice into the barrel or takes it out from the barrel into the supplied jar to jar's full capacity. The volume of juice transferred in any case is equal to the supplied jar's capacity. In this way, he uses both types of jar and pours juice into or takes it out of the barrel as many times as necessary to get the minimum volume achievable by this mechanism. After, the minimum volume is prepared, he uses this as measuring volume to sell juice of that volume. Now you are to help Jashim.

<P>In combinational logic design, a Boolean function is classically expressed as sum of minterms. For example, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>F</I>(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I>) = <IMG WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2349img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{xy}}$"><I>z</I> + <IMG WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2349img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{x}}$"><I>yz</I> + <I>xy</I><IMG WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2349img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{z}}$"> + <I>xyz</I></SPAN> is a Boolean function, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2349img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{xy}}$"><I>z</I>,<IMG WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2349img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{x}}$"><I>yz</I>, <I>xy</I><IMG WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2349img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{z}}$"></SPAN> , and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>xyz</I></SPAN> are the <EM>minterms (MTs)</EM> of the function. Usually, minterms are represented using their binary or decimal representation. For example, minterm <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2349img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{xy}}$"><I>z</I></SPAN> can be represented as 001(binary) or simply as 1(decimal) and minterm <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2349img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{x}}$"><I>yz</I></SPAN> can be represented as 011(binary) or 3(decimal). Using this numeric representation of minterms, the above function can be expressed as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>F</I>(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I>) = <I>S</I>(1, 3, 6, 7)</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>F</I>(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I>) = <I>S</I>(001, 011, 110, 111)</SPAN>. Very often, the binary representation of minterms are used for computer based processing of Boolean function.<P>Using the Boolean algebra theorem <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Ax</I> + <I>A</I><IMG WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2349img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{x}}$"> = <I>A</I></SPAN>, we can combine two product terms to generate a reduced product term. For example, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2349img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{xy}}$"><I>z</I> + <IMG WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2349img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{x}}$"><I>yz</I> = <IMG WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2349img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{x}}$"><I>z</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>xy</I><IMG WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2349img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{z}}$"> + <I>xyz</I> = <I>xy</I></SPAN>. The reduced product terms of a function are called <EM>prime implicants (PIs)</EM> of the function. Therefore, a Boolean function can be expressed as sum of prime implicants. For example, the above function can be expressed as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>F</I>(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I>) = <IMG WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2349img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{x}}$"><I>z</I> + <I>xy</I></SPAN>. Very often, the prime implicants are represented using binary notation, where a missing variable is represented by `<SPAN CLASS="MATH">-</SPAN>' . For example, the prime implicant <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2349img1.png ALT="$ \overline{{x}}$"><I>z</I></SPAN> is represented as 0<SPAN CLASS="MATH">-</SPAN>1 and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>xy</I></SPAN> is represented as 11<SPAN CLASS="MATH">-</SPAN>. Then the above function can be expressed as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>F</I>(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I>) = <I>S</I>(0</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="MATH">-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="MATH">1, 11 -)</SPAN>.<P>Most of the prime implicant generation algorithms generate more prime implicants than the minimum requirement. For example, for the above function, minterms 001 and 011 generate the prime implicant 0<SPAN CLASS="MATH">-</SPAN>1, minterms 110 and 111 generate the prime implicant 11<SPAN CLASS="MATH">-</SPAN> , and minterms 011 and 111 generate the prime implicant <SPAN CLASS="MATH">-</SPAN>11. But the prime implicant <SPAN CLASS="MATH">-</SPAN>11 is not required for expressing the function. Therefore, given a set of minterms and a set of prime implicants for a function, it is required to find a minimal subset of the prime implicants that covers all the minterms of the function. The problem is indeed an optimization problem. An algorithm exists for this problem called <EM>cover most algorithm</EM>, which is discussed below.<P><EM>Cost</EM> of a prime implicant is the number of 0's and 1's in the prime implicant. For example, the cost of the prime implicant 0<SPAN CLASS="MATH">-</SPAN>1 is 2. A prime implicant <EM>covers</EM> a minterm if and only if the prime implicant can be expanded to produce the minterm. For example, the prime implicant 0<SPAN CLASS="MATH">-</SPAN>1 covers the minterms 001 and 011.<P>In cover most algorithm, the <EM>first choice</EM> is a prime implicant that covers maximum number of minterms. If more than one prime implicant cover the same number of minterms, the choice is the prime implicant with the minimum cost. Tie is broken by selecting the first prime implicant in order. The algorithm is illustrated below for the above function using the following table. A `x' in the table indicates covering.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"></DIV><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=7 BORDER FRAME=BOX RULES=GROUPS><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=LEFT><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>MT</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>001</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>011</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>110</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>111</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>Cost</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>No of</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>minterms</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>PI</TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>covered</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>0<SPAN CLASS="MATH">-</SPAN>1</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>X</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>x</TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>2</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>2</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>11<SPAN CLASS="MATH">-</SPAN></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>X</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>x</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>2</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>2</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="MATH">-</SPAN>11</TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>x</TD><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>x</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>2</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>2</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P><P><BR>The first choice is the prime implicant 0<SPAN CLASS="MATH">-</SPAN>1.

<P>The early Greeks have made great contributions to the field of mathematics. Among the great mathematicians of this times were Euclid and Pythagoras. The 23 volume Elements of Euclid is still regarded as on of the cornerstones in the study of mathematics.<P>Euclid made an important contributions to a problem posed by Pythagoras - that of finding all the perfect numbers. The number 6 is called a perfect number because <SPAN CLASS="MATH">6 = 1 + 2 + 3</SPAN>, the sum of all its proper divisors, (i.e. divisors less than 6). Another example of a perfect number is 28, because <SPAN CLASS="MATH">28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14</SPAN>, and 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14 are the divisors of 28 less than 28.<P>In Book IX of the `Elements' Euclid found all the even perfect numbers.

Rubik's cube was a very popular puzzle game in the eighties. It is a cube (of course!) that is divided into three segments which are parallel to the surfaces, and each segment can be rotated independently as shown below:

 ALT="\epsfbox{p2351a.eps}">
</DIV>

<P>
Since there are six possible rotations, each rotation is labeled by a number from 1 through 6. Since we can rotate each segment independently, by rotation 1 we mean rotating the top segment anti-clockwise by 90 degrees (keeping the rest of the cube fixed). Similarly, rotation 2 means to rotate the bottom segment anti-clockwise by 90 degrees. From the above figure you can figure out that rotations 3, 4, 5 and 6 are the anti-clockwise rotations of right, left, back, and front segments respectively.  Just to make the problem interesting, by rotation -1 we mean the same rotation but in the clockwise direction. Similarly -2, -3, -4, -5 and -6 indicate rotations of the corresponding surfaces but in clockwise direction. You probably already have noticed that rotation 1 followed by rotation 1 followed by rotation 1 is actually rotation -1!

The original Rubik's cube had a different color on each surface and as you would rotate the different segments, the colors would be all mixed up. The goal of the puzzle was to bring back all the original colors to their original surfaces (which was not easy!). For this problem we keep things simple and label every small square with a number as shown in the figure. 

<P>
As you can see the small squares of the top surface are labeled by the numbers 1 through 8. The center square is not labeled because no matter which segment is rotated the center squares never change position. The bottom surface is labeled by the numbers 9 through 16 (sorry, you can not see this in the figure), the right surface by 17 through 24, the left surface by 25 through 32 (which you cannot see), the back surface by 33 through 40 (which you cannot see) and the front surface by 41 through 48. Just to make sure that you have understood the labeling scheme properly note that the eight corners are composed of 3 smaller squares and the numbers on them are:

<P>Eshita is a very ecologically conscious person. She works late and every night before going home she makes sure that all the lights are turned off at her workplace to conserve electricity. The workplace is represented as a 2-dimensional grid. Each square in the grid has 4 neighbors in up, down, left, and right directions. The electrical wiring is such that the sides of the grid wrap around i.e., the leftmost and the rightmost columns are neighbors. Similarly, the top and bottom rows are neighbors. This ensures that each of the squares in the grid has 4 neighbors.<P>To standardize our notation, assume that the upper left-most square of the board is position (0, 0). Rows run horizontally and the top row is row 0. Columns are vertical and column 0 is the left-most column. Any reference to a square is by row then column; thus the square (4, 6) means row 4, column 6.<P>So, in figure 1, the grid has 4 columns and 4 rows (all the grids will have same number of rows and columns). The shaded square is denoted as (2, 3). The four neighbors of the square (2, 3) are squares (1, 3), (3, 3), (2, 2) and (2, 0). Similarly, the four neighbors of the square (0, 0) are squares (3, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 3).<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="243" HEIGHT="212" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2353a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p2353a.eps}"></DIV><P>Eshita is told that each square of the grid is a switch and a light. When a switch in some square is pushed, the light in that square and its neighboring squares toggle their ON/OFF state. Figure 2 shows a sequence where, starting from a grid with all the lights OFF, switches (1, 1), and (0, 0) have been pushed. The ON lights are shown as shaded.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="810" HEIGHT="210" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2353a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p2353b.eps}"></DIV><P>Given a grid with some of the lights ON, Eshita needs to say whether it is possible to turn all the lights OFF by pushing some sequence of button pushes. For example, in the first configuration of the 3<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>x</TT></SPAN>3 grid in figure 3, all the lights can be turned OFF by pushing the switches (0, 0), (1, 1) and (2, 2) (some other lights may be turned ON in the intermediate stages, but at the end of this sequence all the lights will be turned off). But in the second configuration, it is not possible to turn all the lights off by pushing any sequence of switches.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="481" HEIGHT="166" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/p2353a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p2353c.eps}"></DIV><P>Your task is to write a program, which given some arbitrary configuration of a grid will determine whether all the lights can be turned off or not.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input file contains the descriptions of several grids.

The FBI is conducting a surveillance of a known criminal hideout
which serves as a communication center for a number of men and
women of nefarious intent. Using sophisticated decryption software
and good old fashion wiretaps, they are able to decode any e-mail
messages leaving the site. However, before any arrest warrants can
be served, they must match actual names with the user ID's on the
messages. While these criminals are evil, they're not stupid, so
they use random strings of letters for their ID's (no <TT>dillingerj</TT>
ID's found here). The FBI knows that each criminal uses only one
ID. The only other information they have which will help them is a
log of names of the people who enter and leave the hideout. In
many cases, this is enough to link the names to the ID's.

Roger Wilco is in charge of the design of a low orbiting space
station for the planet Mars. To simplify construction, the station
is made up of a series of Airtight Cubical Modules (ACM's), which
are connected together once in space. One problem that concerns
Roger is that of (potentially) lethal bacteria that may reside in
the upper atmosphere of Mars. Since the station will occasionally
fly through the upper atmosphere, it is imperative that extra
shielding be used on all faces of the ACMs which make up the
external surface of the station. Roger has made certain that where
two ACMs touch, either edge-to-edge or face-to-face, that joint is
sealed so no bacteria can sneak through. Any face of an ACM shared
by another ACM will not need shielding, of course, nor will a face
which cannot be reached from the outside. Roger could just put
extra shielding on all of the faces of every ACM, but the cost
would be prohibitive. Therefore, he wants to know the exact number
of ACM faces which need the extra shielding.

<P>The Hines Sign company has been contracted to supply roadside signs for the state highway system. The head of the company has put his son Myles Hines in charge of one particular class of signs, those which indicate the number of miles to various towns. Myles is given a layout of the highway system and a set of locations where the signs should go; he is in charge of determining the mileage to nearby cities. To select which cities should be listed on any sign, he uses the following strategy: City X is put on the sign if the sign is on a road such that the shortest path from the intersection immediately preceeding the sign to X uses the road.

<P>The Robots game is a one-player game played on a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">31&#215;31</SPAN> board. The board is partitioned into <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1&#215;1</SPAN> cells arranged in 31 rows and 31 columns. Each cell is indexed by (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I>, <I>c</I></SPAN>) where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I></SPAN> is the row and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN> is the column (starting from 1), and it may be empty, occupied by you, occupied by a robot, or occupied by debris. The object of this game is to move in such a way to destroy all the robots before the robots destroy you.<P>Initially, you occupy the cell at (15,15), and there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN> robots ( <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2360img1.gif ALT="$ \le$"><I>R</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2360img1.gif ALT="$ \le$">50</SPAN>) located in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN> different cells other than (15,15). All other cells are empty. You are also given a list of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> ( <SPAN CLASS="MATH">0<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2360img1.gif ALT="$ \le$"><I>T</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/2360img1.gif ALT="$ \le$">20</SPAN>) cells that are potential teleport locations. You make the first move, and then the robots and you alternate moves. At your move, you are allowed to walk to an adjacent cell in any one of the eight compass directions, teleport to one of the specified teleport locations, or remain stationary. You may walk to an adjacent cell if it is empty. In addition, you may walk to an adjacent cell which contains debris by pushing the debris to the next adjacent cell along the line of movement, provided that the next cell does not already contain debris. If a cell that debris is pushed to contains a robot, that robot is destroyed. If you choose to teleport, the destination must be an empty cell. You may not make any move that will leave you or any debris that you push outside of the board.<P>When the robots move, each robot walks to the adjacent cell (even if it is not empty) in the eight compass directions such that the destination cell is closest to your current position (i.e. after your last move). The distance between two cells (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>c</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>) and (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>c</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>) is defined to be <SPAN CLASS="MATH">| <I>r</I><SUB>1</SUB> - <I>r</I><SUB>2</SUB>| + | <I>c</I><SUB>1</SUB> - <I>c</I><SUB>2</SUB>|</SPAN>. All robots walk at the same time during a move. If two or more robots walk to the same cell, or if a robot walks to a cell containing debris, all of these robots are destroyed. Destroyed robots become debris.<P>You lose the game if any robot walks to your current position, even if multiple robots do so and destroy each other. You win the game if all robots are destroyed and none has moved to your current position.<P>In order to stay in the game as long as possible, you will only consider moves that do not lead to an immediate loss (a loss before your next move). A plausible strategy is to always walk to a cell (or remain stationary) such that the number of robots remaining after your move and the robots' move (i.e. just before your next move) is minimized. In case of a tie, choose the move that maximizes the minimum distance to the remaining robots just before your next move. If there are still ties, choose the move that also minimizes the row index of the destination cell, and finally, break remaining ties by also minimizing the column index.<P>If it is not possible to make a move by walking or by remaining stationary without leading to an immediate loss, you should teleport to the first unused legal destination chosen from a list of locations given to you, as long as it does not lead to an immediate loss. When you search for a teleport site, you should always start the search at the beginning of the list. If no such teleport destination is available, you should remain stationary, leading to an immediate loss.<P>In this problem, you will implement this strategy and see how well it works.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of a number of instances.

<P>Fred Mapper is considering purchasing some land in Louisiana to build his house on. In the process of investigating the land, he learned that the state of Louisiana is actually shrinking by 50 square miles each year, due to erosion caused by the Mississippi River.

Clearly the economy is bound to pick up again soon.  As a forward-thinking Internet
entrepreneur, you think that the 'Net will need a new search engine to serve all the
people buying new computers. Because you're frustrated with the poor results most
search engines produce, your search engine will be better.

<P>
You've come up with what you believe is an innovative approach to document matching.
By giving weight to the number of times a term appears in both the search string and
in the document being checked, you believe you can produce a more accurate search result.

<P>
Your program will be given a search string, followed by a set of documents.  You will
calculate the score for each document and print it to output in the order the document
appears in the input file.  To calculate the score for a document you must first
calculate the term score for each term appearing in the search string.  A term score
is the number of times a term occurs in the search string multiplied by the number of
times it occurs in the document.  The document score is the sum of the square roots of
each term score.

This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between
two consecutive inputs.
</B>

<P>
Each test case consists of a set of documents separated by single lines containing only
ten dashes, ``<TT>----------</TT>''.  No word is longer than 50 characters.  
Total number of words for each document is less than 1000.  The first document is the search string.
The input for each test case terminates with two lines of ten dashes in a row.

<P>
The input documents will use the full ASCII character set.  You must parse each document
into a set of terms.
Terms are separated by white spaces in the input document.  Comparisons between terms are
case-insensitive.  Punctuation is removed from terms prior to comparisons, e.g.
<TT>don't</TT> becomes <TT>dont</TT>.  The resulting terms should contain only the characters
<TT>{[a-z], [0-9]}</TT>.  A term in the input consisting only of punctuation should be
ignored.  You may assume the search string and each document will have at least one
valid term.

<P>A biologist experimenting with DNA modification of bacteria has found a way to make bacterial colonies sensitive to the surrounding population density. By changing the DNA, he is able to <EM>program</EM> the bacteria to respond to the varying densities in their immediate neighborhood.<P>The culture dish is a square, divided into 400 smaller squares <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(20&#215;20)</SPAN>. Population in each small square is measured on a four point scale (from 0 to 3). The DNA information is represented as an array <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I></SPAN>, indexed from 0 to 15, of integer values and is interpreted as follows:<P>In any given culture dish square, let <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> be the sum of that square's density and the densities of the four squares immediately to the left, right, above and below that square (squares outside the dish are considered to have density 0). Then, by the next day, that dish square's density will change by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I>[<I>K</I>]</SPAN> (which may be a positive, negative, or zero value). The total density cannot, however, exceed 3 nor drop below 0.<P>Now, clearly, some DNA programs cause all the bacteria to die off (e.g., <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[- 3, - 3,..., - 3]</SPAN>). Others result in immediate population explosions (e.g., <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[3, 3, 3,..., 3]</SPAN>), and others are just plain boring (e.g., <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[0, 0,..., 0]</SPAN>).

One of the greatest alchemists of the lower Middle Renaissance, Algernon da Vinci
(one of Leonardo's lesser- known cousins), had the foresight to construct his chemical
works directly over a fast-running stream. Through a series of clever pipes and sluices,
he routed portions of the stream past each of the tables where his alchemists prepared
their secret brews, allowing them to dispose of their chemical byproducts into the waters
flowing by the table.

<P>
As Algernon's business grew, he even added additional floors to his factory, with water
lifted to the higher floors by treadmill-powered pumps (much to the dismay of the
apprentices who found themselves assigned to pump duty). The pipework for the entire
disposal system became quite complex. It was even rumored by some that the pipes
actually circled back in some places, so that a particularly odorous compound flushed
away from one table might return to that very same spot a few minutes later.

<P>
All was not well, however. Algernon's factory suffered from a series of mishaps, minor
explosions, gas clouds, etc.  It became obvious that chemicals dumped at one table might
react violently with other chemicals dumped from another table downstream. Algernon
realized that he needed to trace the possible chemical flows through his factory.

<P>
Write a program to aid Algernon in this task. To preserve the secrecy of the chemical
processes that are Algernon's stock in trade, all chemicals will be identified by a
single upper-case letter.  All tables are identified by positive numbers in the range

<P>The Fire Department of New York (FDNY) has always been proud of their response time<P>to fires in New York City, but they want to make their response time even better. To help them with their response time, they want to make sure that the dispatchers know the closest firehouse to any address in the city.

The Cash Cow Consulting Company is challenging the Vice Presidents to increase the
profitability of their departments.  In an effort to provide proper incentive, the
Vice President whose department has the highest Profitability Index (PI) will win a
brand new Porsche.  The contest rules are as follows:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The winning department will have the maximum Profitability Index (sales / development
cost)
</LI>
<LI>Each department must stay within the minimum and maximum cost range.
</LI>
<LI>In the case of equal profitability indexes, the higher profit margin will win
(sales - development cost).
</LI>
<LI>If two departments are still tied, the winning department will develop the smaller
number of features.
</LI>
<LI>If two departments are still tied, the winning department will satisfy the most
customers.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Mike Miser is still driving his high school moped and has determined this is his
chance to upgrade.  He has instructed the engineering department to determine what
it will cost for each feature to be developed.  He then instructed the sales force
to determine what features each customer requires, and what sales that will generate.
(To make a sale to a customer all features required must be provided).

<P>
Mike will then determine which feature combination his division should complete to
maximize his chances of winning the contest.

In recent days, a number of people have been injured after being pushed off the sidewalks
due to overcrowding.  City Hall is interested in figuring out how much pedestrian traffic
its sidewalks receive every day.  The results of this study will be used to determine
whether the city needs to fund more sidewalks.  The city has surveyed various buildings
in several blocks to determine the traffic patterns they generate.  Your job is to take
this survey data and convert it into sidewalk utilization information.

<P>
Your program will read in the size of the map and a map of several city blocks.  Buildings,
streets, and building entrance/exits will be marked on the map.  You will also be given a
list of pedestrian load between several pairs of exits and entrances.  Your program will
determine the paths used by pedestrians between each source and destination, add up the
total pedestrian load from all paths using each street, and output a table of the total
pedestrian load on each square.

The newly established republic of Northopia is in
the process of defining its monetary system, and is looking for a logical way
of deciding on the number and denomination of the units of its money (that is,
its bills and coins).  The government's
assumption is that the total number of bills and coins that must be exchanged
during a cash transaction is a measure of the ``goodness" of the number and
denomination selection.

<P>
Government consultants have already decided that the
smallest unit of money will be worth exactly one ``Northing", and that all other
units of money must be worth an integral number of Northings.  They have also agreed that there should be
no more than ten different monetary units, each worth no more than 10,000 Northings.

<P>
You have been employed to write a program to help in
determining the ``goodness" of a selection of monetary units.  Given a description of a set of proposed
units of money available in Northopia, and the total amount of a transaction,
your program is to determine the fewest number of bills and coins that can be
used in concluding the transaction.

<P>
For example, suppose five units of money are proposed, and
that they are worth 1, 5, 50, 100, and 500 Northings.  A 999 Northing transaction could be completed by paying one
500-Northing unit, four 100-Northing units, one 50-Northing unit, nine
5-Northing units, and four 1-Northing units, and then receiving no units as
change, for a total of 19 units of money exchanged in the transaction.  The minimum number of units, however, would
be obtained by paying with two 500-Northing units and then receiving one
1-Northing unit in change, for a total of 3 units of money involved in the
transaction.

<P>
The input data will contain multiple test
cases.  Each test case will begin with
an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> that indicates the
proposed number of units of money.  This
integer is then followed by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>

integers representing the proposed value of each of those <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> units of money (in one Northing units), one of which will be 1
Northing, as defined by the consultants. 
Finally, the amount of a proposed transaction is given as an integer,
again in one Northing units.  All
transaction amounts will be non-negative. 
The last case will be followed by a single integer zero.

The first pair give the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> coordinates (in a Cartesian coordinate system) of one end of the first mirror, and the second pair give the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> coordinates of the other end of the same mirror. The placement of the other mirrors is given by the remaining numbers in a similar manner. (We assume that mirrors are arbitrarily thin, so we dont need to know their thickness.) The input data for each case will conclude with three real numbers specifying, in order, the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> coordinates of the coherent light source and the angle (in degrees) with which the light leaves the source. Zero degrees is to the right (parallel to the x axis), 90 degrees is vertical (parallel to the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> axis); angles increase as the beam is rotated counterclockwise. The input for the last case will be followed by a single integer zero. The origin of the coherent light source will not be on a mirror, and can be assumed to be transparent (thus light returning to the source will pass through it without effect). There will be no cases in which the light is reflected from the same point of the same side of any mirror more than once. Mirrors do not intersect or touch each other.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>For each input case, display the case number (they are numbered sequentially starting with one), the number of mirrors from which the beam is reflected, the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> coordinates of the point on the last mirror from which the beam is reflected, and the angle the beam takes from that point. The angle should be greater than or equal to zero degrees, but less than 360 degrees, and use the same scheme as employed in the input (that is, 0 degrees is to the right, 90 degrees is vertical, and so forth).

<P>A scientist is conducting an experiment that requires periodic recording of the temperature of a solution. Unfortunately, the only temperature measurement device reports the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, and he must record the temperature in Centigrade. To simplify this task, you have been asked to provide a table with two columns, the left one with temperatures in Fahrenheit, and the right one with temperatures in Centigrade. Every integral temperature in a given range of Fahrenheit temperatures is to appear in the table, along with the integral Centigrade temperatures in the same range, and the columns are to be ordered from low to high.

<P>
Radio broadcasting is normally done only by stations
licensed by governments.  In some parts
of the world, however, clandestine unlicensed transmitters are operated by
groups at odds with the broadcasting standards imposed by the licensing
governments.  You have been employed by
one of these governments to locate some of these illegal transmitters.

<P>
You are provided with data from mobile tracking
stations, each capable of determining its distance from a radio signal's point
of origin (the transmitter).  Given the
data from three of these tracking stations (for each unlicensed transmitter)
and a map of the country, you are to determine the distance and direction of
the particular unlicensed transmitter from the nearest city.

<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
The input will consist of a two-dimensional map using
Cartesian coordinates, followed by the number of transmitters that must be
located, and the corresponding number of sets of data from tracking stations.

<P>
In the map, the data for each city will appear on a
separate line.  The data for each city
will consist of a fifteen character name followed by the citys x and y
coordinates and a radius, all real numbers representing measurements in
kilometers.  The x and y coordinates
give the location of the citys geographical center, while the radius gives the
distance from the center of the city to the city limits (for this problem, all
cities are considered to be circular). 
There will be no more than 50 cities, and the last city on the map will
be located at the origin (<TT>0, 0</TT>).

<P>
Following the map is a single integer that gives the
number of unlicensed transmitters to be located.  For each transmitter there will be readings from three tracking
stations.  Each of these readings
consists of the x and y coordinates of the tracking station and the distance to
the unlicensed transmitter, all real numbers representing measurements in
kilometers.  The three tracking station
locations will not be collinear, and will be at least 10 kilometers from each
other.  No city will be located more
than 6,000 kilometers from the origin.

<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
Your program should process the set of readings for
each unlicensed transmitter and produce a single line of output that specifies
the distance from the unlicensed transmitter to the city limits (not the
geographical center) of the nearest city, the principal compass direction of
the unlicensed transmitter from the nearest city (north, northeast, east,
southeast, south, southwest, west, or northwest), and the name of the nearest
city.

<P>
The distance should be correct to within 0.02
kilometers and displayed with two significant digits.  To determine the compass direction of the unlicensed transmitter
from the nearest city, each of the eight principal directions should be
considered to be at the center of a 45-degree arc in that direction.  Unlicensed transmitters that fall anywhere
in a particular arc are considered to be in that direction.  Thus if due north is at zero degrees, a
transmitter that is at an angle between 22 and 67 degrees, inclusive, will be
considered northeast of the city, while a transmitter that is at an angle
between 68 and 112 degrees, inclusive, would be considered east of the
city.  When determining the direction of
the unlicensed transmitter, an angle should be rounded to the nearest whole
degree.

<P>
Unlicensed transmitters that are located inside a
city's radius are to be reported as originating from that city, with no
distance or directional information reported.

<P>
Each unlicensed transmitter report should include
the transmitter identification number (starting with transmitter 1).  Leave one blank line between the reports.

<P>The ALE (Automatic Link Establishment) protocol is a system designed to allow military radios to agree on a frequency that is to be used for communication. In short, each radio is scanning a number of channels, and it will pause on every channel that it hears some traffic on. If it hears a call (from another radio) to its own address, it will stop on that channel, and alert the operator that a connection has been established.<P>ALE calls are typically encrypted. Your task will be to implement a decryption routine for such encrypted calls. First, a subset of the ALE protocol will be discussed in the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">ALE</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="textbf">Scanning ALE</SPAN> sections. This is followed by a description of the format used to pack the data for transmission in the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">ALE data packing</SPAN> section. Lastly, the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">ALE encryption</SPAN> section defines the encryption algorithm.<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">ALE</SPAN><P>ALE calls consist of two sections: a scanning section, and the calling section. The scanning section precedes the calling section, but it will only be discussed below under the heading <SPAN CLASS="textbf">Scanning ALE</SPAN>. The calling section will now be described.<P>Every radio has a ``self" address which contains only the digits [0-9]. The tricky part is that the addresses are variable length, and therefore they may consist of one, two or three digits, <SPAN CLASS="textit">i.e.</SPAN> ``0", ``01", ``00", ``000", and ``001" are all valid, unique addresses. Think of each address as a string of digits, rather than a number.<P><P><BR>To establish a call, the caller will transmit a sequence that starts with the callee's address, followed by the caller's. The simplest type of call is one between two single-digit-address radios, which looks like this:<P><PRE>
TO   1
TO   1
TIS  7
</PRE><P>This is a call from radio ``7" to radio ``1". The command ``<TT>TO</TT>" is self-explanatory; the ``<TT>TIS</TT>" command is a contraction of ``THIS IS". Note that the callee's address is repeated, <SPAN CLASS="textit">i.e.</SPAN> it appears twice.<P><P><BR>If either the caller or the callee have longer addresses, a more complex sequence is used. Here is an example of a call from radio ``7" to radio ``13":<P><PRE>
TO   1
DATA 3
TO   1
DATA 3
TIS  7
</PRE><P>Note that the callee's address is repeated twice, as in the example above, and that the ``<TT>DATA</TT>" keyword is used to represent the second digit of the address.<P><P><BR>When a three-digit address is used, it looks like this:<P><PRE>
TO   1
DATA 3
REP  5
TO   1
DATA 3
REP  5
TIS  7
</PRE><P>This is a call from radio ``7" to radio ``135". Note that the third digit of the address is represented using the ``<TT>REP</TT>" command (REPeat, meaning repeat of the command ``<TT>DATA</TT>", not the digit of the preceding ``<TT>DATA</TT>" command. The ``<TT>REP</TT>" command has its own digit payload.)<P><P><BR>The same principle is used for the caller's address, so that when radio ``721" calls radio ``51", it looks like this:<P><PRE>
TO   5
DATA 1
TO   5
DATA 1
TIS  7
DATA 2
REP  1
</PRE><P><P><BR>To summarise, a typical non-scanning call uses the following syntax:<P><PRE>
TO &lt;d1&gt; [DATA &lt;d2&gt; [REP &lt;d3&gt;]] 
TO &lt;d1&gt; [DATA &lt;d2&gt; [REP &lt;d3&gt;]] 
TIS &lt;s1&gt; [DATA &lt;s2&gt; [REP &lt;s3&gt;]]
</PRE>where <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt; <I>d</I>1 &gt; - &lt; <I>d</I>3 &gt;</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt; <I>s</I>1 &gt; - &lt; <I>s</I>3 &gt;</SPAN> represent the digits of the callee and caller's addresses, and [ ] indicates optional components. Note, each command starts on a new line.<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Scanning ALE</SPAN><P>There is one additional problem, though. Assume that radio ``7" wants to make a call to radio ``1". Radio ``1" is scanning through <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> channels, spending a few milliseconds on each to see if there is a call for it on that channel. If radio ``7" thus decides to use channel 3 for the call, it must transmit long enough so that radio ``1" has time to go through all its channels and still be in time to hear the call from radio ``7". To solve this problem, radio ``7" will repeat the first command of the call (containing the first digit of the callee's address) a number of times, thus giving radio ``1" the opportunity to hear its own address (the first digit thereof). Note that other stations, like radio ``15" or radio ``123" will also stop to listen, but they will continue scanning once the full address follows, and they can unambiguously determine that the call is not for them. Thus, the simple call listed in the first example above will become, for example,<P><PRE>
TO   1
TO   1
TO   1
TO   1
TO   1
TIS  7
</PRE>where the number of repetitions of the first ``<TT>TO</TT>" command is arbitrary, but <SPAN CLASS="textbf">fewer than 10</SPAN>. Only the first ``<TT>TO</TT>" command is repeated, so that the second example (a call from ``7" to ``13") becomes, for example,<P><PRE>

TO   1
TO   1
TO   1
TO   1
TO   1

TIS  7
</PRE><P><P><BR>The final syntax for a scanning ALE call is thus:<P><PRE>
TO &lt;d1&gt;* 
TO &lt;d1&gt; [DATA &lt;d2&gt; [REP &lt;d3&gt;]] 
TO &lt;d1&gt; [DATA &lt;d2&gt; [REP &lt;d3&gt;]] 
TIS &lt;s1&gt; [DATA &lt;s2&gt; [REP &lt;s3&gt;]]
</PRE>where ``<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>*</TT></SPAN>" means zero of more repetitions of the stated command. The sequence of repetitions of the first ``<TT>TO</TT>" command is called the scanning section.<P><P><BR>In a valid scanning ALE call, only certain commands may follow others. Here is a list of valid combinations:<P><UL><LI><TT>TO</TT> may be followed by <TT>TO</TT>, <TT>DATA</TT>, or <TT>TIS</TT> </LI><LI><TT>TIS</TT> may be followed by <TT>DATA</TT> </LI><LI><TT>DATA</TT> may be followed by <TT>TO</TT>, <TT>REP</TT>, or <TT>TIS</TT> </LI><LI><TT>REP</TT> may be followed by <TT>TO</TT>, or <TT>TIS</TT> </LI></UL><P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">ALE data packing</SPAN><P>The individual commands can be packed into bytes using the following format:<P><UL><LI>The commands are represented using 4-bit values, which can be packed into the upper 4 bits of a byte. This effectively assigns hexadecimal values as follows: <TT>TO</TT> = 0x00, <TT>TIS</TT> = 0x10, <TT>DATA</TT> = 0x20, and <TT>REP</TT> = 0x30 </LI><LI>An address digit is represented as a 4-bit value, thus <SPAN CLASS="MATH">0 = 0, 1 = 1,..., 9 = 9</SPAN>. These values are stored in the lower 4 bits of a byte. Note that all other 4-bit values (0x0a through 0x0f) are invalid. </LI></UL><P>The packed commands are thus formed by adding (or bit-wise OR-ing) the command value to the digit value. The upper two bits of the resulting byte are always zero. This means that <TT>TO 1</TT> is encoded as 0x01, and <TT>REP 7</TT> as 0x37, and so on.<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">ALE encryption</SPAN><P>Now things get more interesting: this is a military protocol, hence the data must be encrypted.

Radio ``1" can arrive on the channel (that radio ``7" is calling on) at any time. Thus, if radio ``7" just blindly encrypted the entire call, it would be very difficult for radio ``1" to determine the correct encryption phase, since radio ``1" effectively misses the first <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> words of the call, and it does not know what the value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> is. The solution is to alternate between key phase 0 and key phase 1 for the scanning part of the call. This reduces the search space for radio ``1" considerably, making the problem tractable.

<P>Sets of integers having particular properties appear in lots of applications. In this problem, you are to determine the number of integers in a particular set. Each set to be considered has the value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>first</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> as its smallest value, and the value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>last</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> as its largest value. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>first</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>last</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> are supplied as input data items. Every other integer in the set is larger than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>first</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and smaller than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>last</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and also has the property that it differs from another element already in the set by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>diff</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> (another integer value that will be supplied in the input).<P>Lets consider an example. Suppose <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>first</I> = 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>last</I> = 10</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>diff</I> = 3</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Clearly 1 and 10 are in the set. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>first</I> + <I>diff</I> = 4</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is also in the set. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>last</I>&nbsp;<I>diff</I> = 7</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is in the set as well. Now we can consider <SPAN CLASS="MATH">4 + <I>diff</I> = 7</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> for membership. But 7 is already in the set. Clearly this set includes only the integers 1, 4, 7, and 10. The number of elements in the set is 4, and that would be the proper output for this input.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input will contain multiple cases.

<P>
Most of you are probably familiar with JumbleÃ¯Â¿Â½ a daily newspaper feature, where you reconstruct scrambled words.  For example, you might be given `<TT>ROYIN</TT>' and have to come up with `<TT>IRONY</TT>'.

<P>
One aspect that makes a particular scrambling of letters ``hard" is if it looks like a ``real" word.  Thus, `<TT>ROYIN</TT>' is tougher scramble than `<TT>NRYIO</TT>' because it confuses your brain into thinking that it's already a word.

<P>
Another aspect that makes a scrambling harder is whether letters are in their correct position.  So, `<TT>RIONY</TT>' isn't a very good scramble, even if it might kind-of look like a real word.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Your task is to write a program that scores scrambles as `<TT>good</TT>', `<TT>fair</TT>', `<TT>poor</TT>', or `<TT>not</TT>'.  Your program will read pairs of words and score them.  A scramble is `<TT>good</TT>' if none of its letters are in the correct place and it looks ``real" (more on that later).  A scramble is `<TT>poor</TT>' if it doesn't look ``real" and has either the first letter in place or any two consecutive letters in place.  If the word isn't scrambled at all, it is said to be `<TT>not</TT>' scrambled.  Otherwise, the scramble is ``fair".

<P>
How do we know if a word looks "real"?  We will use an extremely crude heuristic that the word must alternate between vowels (`<TT>Y</TT>' is a vowel for these purposes) and consonants. However, certain groups of vowels and consonants are allowed:

<P>

  BL BR CH CK CL CR DR FL FR GH GL GR
  KL KR KW PF PL PR SC SCH SCR SH SHR
  SK SL SM SN SP SQ ST SW TH THR TR
  TW WH WR
</PRE> 

<P>
Also, all double consonants are allowed.  No other combinations are allowed, so `<TT>SWR</TT>' wouldn't be good, even though both `<TT>SW</TT>' and `<TT>WR</TT>' are both OK.

<P>

<P><P>

<B>DUCK GOLO</B>! 	(That's a scramble of `GOOD LUCK'!)

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input for your program will be pairs of words, all upper-case letters, alternating until a ``word" of `<TT>999</TT>' is encountered.  The first word of the pair is the original word; the second is the scrambled version that you must evaluate. You may assume that the words are anagrams of one another and contain no spaces.  Words will be at least 3 letters in length.

<P>
When designing an HTML page for display on the World Wide Web, the length of time it takes to display the page in the user's browser is a major consideration. Studies show that most users will not wait more than 10 seconds for a page to download before ``clicking out", and costing the web site valuable ``eyeballs". 

<P>
Many current HTML editors have the ability to let the designer know page download time for the ``average" user. Your task is to write such a utility to compute download time, assuming a ``static" HTML document. (For our purposes, a static HTML document is one that contains no multimedia, Java applets or dynamically generated content. It consists of only HTML code and images.) Download time will be determined by the total size (in bytes) of all images to be displayed in the document, plus the document size (in bytes, 1 character = 1 byte), which is computed by its character count. This total number of bytes is used to determine the download time, assuming 1000 bytes = 0.2 second. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
For example, given a simple HTML document such as this:

<P>
<PRE>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;ACM&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/acm.jpg&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/acm.jpg&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</PRE> 
and assuming the size of ``acm.jpg" is 10k bytes and ``contest.jpg" is 5k bytes we can compute the download time as follows:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-</DT>
<DD>Number of bytes in document: 112 (assume there is a CR/LF character at the end of EACH line)
</DD>
<DT>-</DT>
<DD>Number of bytes in images: 15000
</DD>
<DT>-</DT>
<DD>TOTAL SIZE: 15112 bytes
</DD>
<DT>-</DT>
<DD>DOWNLOAD TIME: 3.02 seconds
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
For this problem, we are going to add an attribute to the <TT>IMG</TT> tag, called ``<TT>size</TT>". This attribute will have an integer value, denoting the image file size in bytes. For example, the sample above would look like this:

<P>
<PRE>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;ACM&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/acm.jpg size="10000"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/acm.jpg size="5000"&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</PRE> 

<P>
Note that if an image is used more than once on the page, it is only counted once in determining download time, since it won't have to be downloaded again, once it's been downloaded originally. (Images with the same file name, but in different directories are NOT the same image. Image names ARE the same if a case-insensitive string compare declares them to be equal.)

<P>
Note that HTML tags are NOT case sensitive.

<P>
Note that other HTML tags besides the <TT>&lt;IMG&gt;</TT> tag can contain the ``<TT>SRC=</TT>" attribute and the ``<TT>size=</TT>" attribute.

<P>
Note also that an <TT>&lt;IMG&gt;</TT> tag can contain the ``SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/acm.jpgMATH">&lt;</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>IMG<SPAN CLASS="MATH">&gt;</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> tags:

<P>
<PRE>
&lt;IMG SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/acm.jpg size="10000"&gt;

&lt;Img HEIGHT="42" WIDTH="42" size="5000" 
SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/23/acm.jpg&gt;
</PRE> 

<P>
(You may assume that the path/image name and size value are surrounded by double quotes.)

<P>
Specifically, you may assume that the only spaces in a tag will be either between <!-- MATH
 $name=value$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>name</I> = <I>value</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> pairs or embedded in quoted strings. More specifically, there will be no spaces between the <TT>&lt;</TT> and tag name, around the equal signs, before the <TT>&gt;</TT>, or anywhere else not already specified.

Each HTML document listing will begin with <TT>&lt;HTML&gt;</TT> tag and end with <TT>&lt;/HTML&gt;</TT> tag (not case-sensitive!), and will contain 0 or more image tags. There will be no blank lines within the HTML document. The ending <TT>&lt;/HTML&gt;</TT> tag for each test document listing will be the last item on a line.

<P>With the large amount of genomic DNA sequence data being made available, it is becoming more important to find genes (parts of the genomic DNA which are responsible for the synthesis of proteins) in these sequences. It is known that for eukaryotes (in contrast to prokaryotes) the process is more complicated, because of the presence of <EM>junk DNA</EM> that interrupts the coding regions of genes in the genomic sequence. That is, a gene is composed by several pieces (called <EM>exons</EM>) of coding regions. It is known that the order of the exons is maintained in the protein synthesis process, but the number of exons and their lengths can be arbitrary.<P>Most gene finding algorithms have two steps: in the first they search for possible exons; in the second they try to assemble a largest possible gene, by finding a chain with the largest possible number of exons. This chain must obey the order in which the exons appear in the genomic sequence. We say that exon <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <EM>appears</EM> before exon <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN> if the end of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> precedes the beginning of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN>.<P>The objective of this problem is, given a set of possible exons, to find the chain with the largest possible number of exons that could be assembled to generate a gene.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Several input instances are given.

Then, each of the next <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> lines contains a pair of integer numbers that represent the position in which the exon starts and ends in the genomic sequence.

The population of the small village of Zombiniville is famous for its genetic characteristics.
The inhabitants present only 5 variations on 4 aspects (hair, eyes, nose and feet).
Two research companies,
Gentec and Genco, tabulated an extensive series of data on the inhabitants of Zombiniville.

<P>
Both companies used symbols for the 4 aspects and its variations.  Gentec used the groups
(A,B,C,D,E), (F,G,H,I,J), (K,L,M,N,O) and (P,Q,R,S,T), while Genco used (a,b,c,d,e),
(f,g,h,i,j),
(k,l,m,n,o) and (p,q,r,s,t), but not necessarily for the same groups or in the same
order inside
a group. For example, the group (A,B,C,D,E) from Gentec could correspond to (r,p,t,s,q) from
Genco. In other words, ``A'' corresponds to ``r'', ``B'' corresponds to ``p'', ``C''
to ``t'', ``D'' to ``s'' and ``E'' to ``q''.

<P>
Recently the two companies reached an agreement and decided to exchange their research
results.  However, a group of international activists against human genetic research
invaded the offices of the two companies and destroyed part of the reports - exactly
the interpretation of the codes.

<P>
You and your team were hired to develop a program to establish a relationship among the two
notations. As the companies don't want to waste its capital at random, they prepared a
battery of tests for your program, before buying it.

For each test case, an association table should be supplied, as in the example below.
Note that the
pairs are printed in alphabetical order of the capital letters, tive per line.
Obviously, Gentec and
Genco are testing your program, and they don't supply their real data. You can
assume that the
association table is changed between test cases. You should print only the associations
that are
unequivocally determined. If there are two or more possibilities for a given letter,
you should print a question mark after this letter.

<P>Interval arithmetic is a field of math where in numbers, both constants and variables, are represented not as a single, exact value, but rather as a range or interval with lower and upper bounds. Under normal arithmetic, a scalar value represents a single point on the number line, such as 3.25. Under interval arithmetic, a scalar represents a segment of the number line, perhaps [3,5]. Exact values, when represented as intervals, have identical upper and lower limits.<P>Arithmetical operations on two intervals involve the pairing of every point in one interval with every point in the other interval and performing the desired operation on each pair of points. The set of all points resulting from the operation form an interval. For example, adding [3, 5] to [-10, 1] yields [-7, 6], the interval where in all possible pairings of the addition of points from [3, 5] and [-10, 1] must lie. You are to write a program that can interpret single-line expressions of scalar interval constants with unary minus and the four basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. An example of each operation is shown below.<P><P><BR>unary minus: <SPAN CLASS="MATH">- [- 3, 5] = [- 5, 3]</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark><P>addition: <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[3, 5] + [- 10, 1] = [- 7, 6]</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark><P>subtraction: <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[3, 5] - [- 10, 1] = [2, 15]</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark><P>multiplication: <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[3, 5] <TT>*</TT> [- 10, 1] = [- 50, 5]</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark><P>division: <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[3, 5]/[- 10, - 0.1] = [- 50, - 0.3]</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Input to the program consists of one or more scalar intervals of the form [min,max] in infix expressions involving paTentheses, unary minus (-), and binary addition (+), subtraction (-) , multiplication (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>*</TT></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>), and division (/).

The eccentric sculptor Albrecht Caravaggio Mondrian has been inspired by the history of the computer to create works of art that he calls ``Jacquard circuits." Each of his works of art consists of a series of polygonal circuit boards (defined below), all having the same shape but at different scales, joined together with wire or string into a three-dimensional tiered structure. Figure 1 below shows an example with two levels and a pentagonal shape.

<P>

 ALT="\epsfbox{p2395a.eps}">
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>
</DIV>

<P>
A.C.M. (as he is known to his friends) bases his art upon the punched hole cards of the Jacquard loom (that were later adapted by Charles Babbage for his analytical engine) and upon the regular grid layout approach often used in circuit interfacing (for instance, Pin Grid Arrays). 

<P>
The circuit boards used in the sculptures are in the shapes of lattice polygons. A lattice polygon is defined as any closed, non-self-intersecting cycle of straight line segments that join points with integer coordinates, with no two consecutive line segments parallel. For any given lattice polygon <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, there is a smallest lattice polygon with the same shape and orientation as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> -- call this the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">origin</SPAN>. Smaller polygons of the same shape and orientation as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> are called its predecessors and polygons larger than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> are its successors. (See Figure 2 on the following page.) 

<P>
To build one of his sculptures, A.C.M. begins by randomly selecting <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> lattice points and then drawing a pattern by connecting these points. (Note that not all of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> points are necessarily vertices of a lattice polygon. This may happen, for example, if three or more consecutive points are collinear.) Let <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> be the lattice polygon determined by the pattern. Then he determines the origin corresponding to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, selects the number of levels, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, he wishes to use, and constructs the first <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> polygonal circuit boards in the series (that is, the origin and its first <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I> - 1</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> successors). Each lattice point lying strictly within the boundary of any of these polygons is a hole where strings or wires meet. 

<P>
The hard part of creating the sculpture is tying together all the strings or wires that meet at a given hole. Furthermore, some of A.C.M.'s famous miniaturized sculptures, built using nano-engineering techniques, involve hundreds of thousands of levels. Mondrian would like a way to determine, given a polygonal shape and the number of levels, how many holes there will be in the final sculpture. You must write a program to help him. (For example, the sculpture in Figure 1 above has 15 holes.) Assume holes have zero diameter.

Collecting your luggage after a flight can be far from trivial. Suitcases and bags appear on a conveyor belt, and hundreds of passengers fight for a good vantage point from which to find and retrieve their belongings. Recently, the Narita Airport Authority has decided to make this process more efficient. Before redesigning their baggage claim areas, they need a simulation program to determine how average passengers behave when collecting their luggage. This simulation assumes that passengers will always take a path of straight line segments to reach their luggage in the least amount of time. 

<P>
For this problem, a conveyor belt is modeled as a simple polygon. A luggage piece appears on some point of the conveyor belt, and then moves along the conveyor belt at a constant speed. A passenger is initially positioned at some point outside the conveyor belt polygon. As soon as the piece of luggage appears, the passenger moves at a constant speed (which is greater than the speed of the luggage piece) in order to pick up the luggage. The passenger's path, which may not cross over the conveyer belt but may touch it, puts the passenger in the same position as the moving piece of luggage in the least amount of time. 

<P>
In the following figure, the conveyor belt is depicted as a polygon ABCDEF. The luggage starts at the top-left corner (Point A) and moves in counterclockwise direction around the polygon as shown with the small arrows. The passenger begins at point P and moves on the path that puts him and the luggage into the same place (point M in the figure) in the shortest amount of time. The passenger's path is shown by a red arrow. This figure corresponds to the first sample input.

GIF files are a popular way of storing images, but, being an old format, they suffer from some of the
limitations of the display haTdware that was available at the time the format was devised. One of these
limitations is a maximum color palette of 256 colors. This means that from the millions of colors that can
be represented using 8 bits each for red, green and blue, at most 256 of them aTe used to represent every
color in a single GIF image. Through a clever choice of these colors, and a technique (called dithering) for
approximating the missing colors, a reasonably good quality image can still be produced.

<P>
We want to be able to insert one GIF into another GIF as a small inset image, using the palette of the
larger GIF, and using dithering to represent the colors from the smaller GIF that are not shared by the two
GIFs. Your task is to write a program to tell us if this is possible or not.

<P>
When a pixel must be assigned the wrong color because the right color is not in the color palette,
dithering is used to adjust the colors of the pixels around it, so that the average color around that pixel is
close to the correct one. For example, if the desired color is redder than the color chosen from the palette,
the surrounding pixels are made redder than they should have been to compensate for it. Since the colors of
these pixels must also be chosen from the palette, the question is whether the desired color can be obtained
by averaging colors chosen from the palette.

<P>
Each color is given as a triplet <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I>, <I>g</I>, <I>b</I>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> of intensities for red, green and blue, so it can represent a point
on a 3-dimensional grid, with the intensity of red on the X axis, green on the Y, and blue on the Z. Colors
in the palette are fixed points on this grid, while an average color can be viewed as a movable point whose
position is determined by the pull of perfect springs attached between it and the palette colors that make up
the average. If palette colors surround the desired color, no matter how remotely, springs can be attached
that will pull the average there. But, if all of the palette colors are to one side of the desired color, so that a
plane could be interposed between it and them, then no spring can cross the plane to pull the average there.

<P>
Take a palette with just the colors (64,64,64), (255,64,64), (64,255,64) and (64,64,255). Interpreted as
points, the colors define a triangular pyramid whose sides are the planes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>red</I> = 64</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <!-- MATH
 $green = 64$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>green</I> = 64</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>blue</I> = 64</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>
and <!-- MATH
 $red+ green + blue = 383$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>red</I> + <I>green</I> + <I>blue</I> = 383</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>.  If a color is outside this pyramid, a plane can be placed between it and
the pyramid, separating it from all of the colors that define the pyramid. However, if a color is on the
surface or inside the pyramid, no plane can separate it from every color that defines the pyramid. Thus,
for this example, the color <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I>, <I>g</I>, <I>b</I>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> can be dithered if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I><IMG

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. It follows that the color (127,127,127) can be dithered using this color palette, while the colors (16,64,106) and
(130,130,130) can not.

<P>
Your input consists of one or more sets of color palettes, multiple sets being separated from each other
by empty lines, and the last set being followed by end-of-file. In each set, the first color palette is the palette
for the main GIF, while those immediately following it without any empty lines, are the color palettes for one
or more inset GIFs. Each color palette begins with a line of at most 255 bytes, containing the name of the
GIF. The next line contains a single integer from 1 to 256, giving the number of colors in the palette. Each
succeeding line represents one of these colors, as many lines as there are colors in the palette. These lines
each contain three integers that represent the intensities of red, green and blue in the color. The integers
range from O to 255, and are separated from each other by any combination of spaces or tabs.

<P>
As part of your graduate research work at Swamp County College, your advisor has requested that you
analyze sets of remote-sensing data collected from a satellite. Processed data from this particular satellite is
publicly available, but only at a premium. However, the raw, unprocessed data is for sale at minimal cost.
Your advisor has decided to give you the opportunity to exercise your programing skills on the raw data.

<P>
You have been provided with documentation of the raw data format and with files that (supposedly)
contain the raw data. As a first step, you will verify the presence of data within the files. The data within
each file has been stored as it was received from the satellite, in a single bit-stream. Within a file, one or
multiple segments ofvalid data may exist, separated by segments where no data was collected or by segments
of garbled (noisy) data. No data or garbled data may also occur at the beginning and/or end of a file. In
the worst case, a file may contain no valid data.

<P>
The raw data is partitioned into packets of 80 bytes each. Bytes are numbered starting at O. Assume
8 bits/byte. Bytes 4-7 ofeach packet contain a distinct 32-bit pattern known as the synchronization, or sync
code. The sync code, which is a constant for the satellite, acts as a marker by which the presence of the raw
data can be recognized within the bit stream. Bytes 9-12 of each packet contain a counter, represented as a
32-bit unsigned integer. Note, however, that no byte alignment was performed on the data before delivery
to you. As a result, the bytes of the data packets may be bit-shifted relative to the byte boundaries of the
data stored in each file. You may assume that the relative omsets between packet byte boundaries and data
byte boundaries are constant within a given file.

<P>
A valid packet is defined to be a complete packet containing the sync code in the correct location. For
the purposes of this discussion, an invalid packet is an 80-byte length that does not contain the sync code in
the correct location. Since the sync code can occur naturally anywhere in the bit stream, the beginning of a
valid data segment is (arbitrarily) defined to be three or more contiguous valid packets. Once the beginning
of a valid data segment has been found, the end of the segment is defined to be the end of the last valid
packet before three or more invalid packets OR the end of the last valid packet before end-of-file, whichever
comes first. If a valid data segment is followed by fewer than three invalid packets, you should treat those
invalid packets as valid packets (and thus as part of the valid data segment).

<P>
Given an input file, your program is to locate all segments of valid data within the file and report for
each segment

<P>

<OL>
<LI>The omset, relative to the start of the file, of the first bit of the segment, where bit omsets are numbered
starting at 0. Express this value as a non-negative integer.
</LI>
<LI>The number of packets in the segment. Express this value as a positive integer.
</LI>
<LI>The value of the counter for the first packet in the segment. Express this value as a non-negative integer.
</LI>
</OL>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
An input file will be a binary file ofnonzero length up to a maximum of 1 MB. For the sync code and counter
fields, bytes are ordered from high to low. Bits are ordered from high to low within a byte. The satellite's
sync code is (hexadecimal) 03915ED3.

<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
For each segment, report the omset, number of packets, and counter in that order on a single line. All
values should be expressed in decimal. Use a single space to separate each of the values. If your program
finds no valid data in the file, it should print the single line `<TT>No valid data found</TT>' terminated by a newline.

<P>
Note: Input to your program will be a binary file. For readability, the sample input has been expressed in
hexadecimal format with whitespace added after each byte.

<P>The surveyor starship Hakodate-maru is famous for her two fuel containers with unbounded capacities. They hold the same type of atomic fuel balls.<P>There, however, is an inconvenience. The shapes of the fuel containers #1 and #2 are always cubic and regular tetrahedral respectively. Both of the fuel containers should be either empty or filled according to their shapes. Otherwise, the fuel balls become extremely unstable and may explode in the fuel containers. Thus, the number of fuel balls for the container #1 should be a cubic number (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> for some <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> = 0, 1, 2, 3,...</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) and that for the container #2 should be a tetrahedral number ( <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I>(<I>n</I> + 1)(<I>n</I> + 2)/6</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> for some <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> = 0, 1, 2, 3,...</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>).<P>Hakodate-maru is now at the star base Goryokaku preparing for the next mission to create a precise and detailed chart of stars and interstellar matters. Both of the fuel containers are now empty. Commander Parus of Goryokaku will soon send a message to Captain Future of Hakodate-maru on how many fuel balls Goryokaku can supply. Captain Future should quickly answer to Commander Parus on how many fuel balls she requests before her ship leaves Goryokaku. Of course, Captain Future and her omcers want as many fuel balls as possible.<P>For example, consider the case Commander Parus offers 151200 fuel balls. If only the fuel container #1 were available (i.e. ifthe fuel container #2 were unavailable), at most 148877 fuel balls could be put into the fuel container since <!-- MATH

Using both of the fuel containers #1 and #2, 151200 fuel balls can be put into the fuel containers since <SPAN CLASS="MATH">151200 = 39 <TT>x</TT> 39 <TT>x</TT> 39 + 81 <TT>x</TT> 82 <TT>x</TT> 83/6</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. In this case, Captain Future's answer should be ``1512009".<P>Commander Parus's offer cannot be greater than 151200 because of the capacity of the fuel storages of Goryokaku. Captain Future and her omcers know that well.<P>You are a fuel engineer assigned to Hakodate-maru. Your duty today is to help Captain Future with calculating the number of fuel balls she should request.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input is a sequence of at most 1024 positive integers.

<P>The city of Hakodate recently established a commodity exchange market. To participate in the market, each dealer transmits through the Internet an order consisting of his or her name, the type of the order (buy or sell), the name of the commodity, and the quoted price.<P>In this market a deal can be made only if the price of a sell order is lower than or equal to the price of a buy order. The price of the deal is the mean of the prices of the buy and sell orders, where the mean price is rounded downward to the nearest integer. To exclude dishonest deals, no deal is made between a pair of sell and buy orders from the same dealer. The system of the market maintains the list of orders for which a deal has not been made and processes a new order in the following manner.<P><UL><LI>For a new sell order, a deal is made with the buy order with the highest price in the list satisfying the conditions.

<P>A fisherman named Etadokah awoke in a very small island. He could see calm, beautiful and blue sea around the island. The previous night he had encountered a terrible storm and had reached this uninhabited island. Some wrecks of his ship were spread around him. He found a square wood-frame and a long thread among the wrecks. He had to survive in this island until someone came and saved him.<P>In order to catch fish, he began to make a kind of fishnet by cutting the long thread into short threads and fixing them at pegs on the square wood-frame (Figure 1). He wanted to know the sizes of the meshes of the fishnet to see whether he could catch small fish as well as large ones.<P>The wood-frame is perfectly square with four thin edges one meter long.. a bottom edge, a top edge, a left edge, and a right edge. There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> pegs on each edge, and thus there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH">4<I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> pegs in total.

<P>At the risk of its future, International Cellular Phones Corporation (ICPC) invests its resources in developing new mobile phones, which are planned to be equipped with Web browser, mailer, instant messenger, and many other advanced communication tools. Unless members of ICPC can complete this stiff job, it will eventually lose its market share.<P>You are now requested to help ICPC to develop intriguing text input software for small mobile terminals. As you may know, most phones today have twelve buttons, namely, ten number buttons from ``0" to ``9" and two special buttons ``<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>*</TT></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>" and ``#". Although the company is very ambitious, it has decided to follow today's standards and conventions. You should not change the standard button layout, and should also pay attention to the following standard button assignment.<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=4 BORDER FRAME=HSIDES RULES=GROUPS><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COL ALIGN=CENTER><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>button</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>letters</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>button</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>letters</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>2</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>a, b, c</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>6</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>m, n, o</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>3</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>d, e, f</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>7</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>p, q, r, s</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>4</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>g, h, i</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>8</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>t, u, v</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>5</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>j, k, l</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>9</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>w, x, y, z</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P><P><BR>This means that you can only use eight buttons for text input.<P>Most users of current ICPC phones are rushed enough to grudge wasting time on even a single button press. Your text input software should be economical of users' time so that a single button press is sumcient for each character input. In consequence, for instance, your program should accept a sequence of button presses ``77377" and produce the word ``press". Similarly, it should translate ``77377843288866" into ``press the button".<P>Ummm... It seems impossible to build such text input software since more than one English letter is represented by a digit!.

<P>Taro and Hanako, students majoring in biology, have been engaged long in observations of beehives. Their interest is in finding any egg patterns laid by queen bees of a specific wild species. A queen bee is said to lay a batch ofeggs in a short time. Taro and Hanako have never seen queen bees laying eggs. Thus, every time they find beehives, they find eggs just laid in hive cells.<P>Taro and Hanako have a convention to record an egg layout.. they assume the queen bee lays eggs, moving from one cell to an adjacent cell along a path containing no cycles. They record the path of cells with eggs. There is no guarantee in biology for them to find an acyclic path in every case. Yet they have never failed to do so in their observations.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="799" HEIGHT="265" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2404a.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p2404a.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>There are only six possible movements from a cell to an adjacent one, and they agree to write down those six by letters <TT>a</TT>, <TT>b</TT>, <TT>c</TT>, <TT>d</TT>, <TT>e</TT>, and <TT>f</TT> ounterclockwise as shown in Figure 2. Thus the layout in Figure 1 may be written down as ``<TT>faafd</TT>".<P>Taro and Hanako have investigated beehives in a forest independently. Each has his/her own way to approach beehives, protecting oneself from possible bee attacks.<P>They are asked to report on their work jointly at a conference, and share their own observation records to draft a joint report. At this point they find a serious fault in their convention. They have never discussed which direction, in an absolute sense, should be taken as ``<TT>a</TT>", and thus Figure 2 might be taken as, e.g., Figure 3 or Figure 4. The layout shown in Figure 1 may be recorded differently, depending on the direction looking at the beehive and the path assumed: ``bcbdb" with combination of Figure 3 and Figure 5, or ``bccac" with combination of Figure 4 and Figure 6.<P>A beehive can be observed only from its front side and never from its back, so a layout cannot be confused with its mirror image.<P>Since they may have observed the same layout independently, they have to find duplicated records in their observations (Of course, they do not record the exact place and the exact time of each observation). Your mission is to help Taro and Hanako by writing a program that checks whether two observation records are made from the same layout.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="716" HEIGHT="267" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2404a.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p2404b.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="830" HEIGHT="268" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2404a.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p2404c.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input starts with a line containing the number of record pairs that follow.

<P>
Let's play a traditional game Nim. You and I are seated across a table and we have a hundred
stones on the table (we know the number of stones exactly). We play in turn and at each turn,
you or I can remove one to four stones from the heap. You play first and the one who removed
the last stone loses.

<P>
In this game, you have a winning strategy. To see this, you first remove four stones and leave
96 stones. No matter how I play, I will end up with leaving 92-95 stones. Then you will in turn
leave 91 stones for me (verify this is always possible). This way, you can always leave <SPAN CLASS="MATH">5<I>k</I> + 1</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>
stones for me and finally I get the last stone, sigh. If we initially had 101 stones, on the other
hand, I have a winning strategy and you are doomed to lose.

<P>
Let's generalize the game a little bit. First, let's make it a team game. Each team has n players
and the <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> players are seated around the table, with each player having opponents at both
sides. Turns round the table so the two teams play alternately. Second, let's vary the maximum
number ofstones each player can take. That is, each player has his/her own maximum number
ofstones he/she can take at each turn (The minimum is always one). So the game is asymmetric
and may even be unfair.

<P>
In general, when played between two teams of experts, the outcome of a game is completely
determined by the initial number ofstones and the minimum number of stones each player can
take at each turn. In other words, either team has a winning strategy.

<P>
You are the head-coach of a team.  In each game, the umpire shows both teams the initial
number of stones and the maximum number of stones each player can take at each turn. Your
team plays first. Your job is, given those numbers, to instantaneously judge whether your team
has a winning strategy.

<P>
Incidentally, there is a rumor that Captain Future and her officers of Hakodate-maru love this
game, and they are killing their time playing it during their missions. You wonder where the
stones are?. Well, they do not have stones but do have plenty of balls in the fuel containers!.

<P>
During a voyage of the starship Hakodate-maru (see Problem A), researchers found strange
synchronized movements of stars. Having heard these observations, Dr. Extreme proposed a
theory of ``super stars". Do not take this term as a description of actors or singers. It is a
revolutionary theory in astronomy.

<P>
According to this theory, stars we are observing are not independent objects, but only small
portions of larger objects called super stars. A super star is filled with invisible (or transparent)
material, and only a number of points inside or on its surface shine. These points are observed
as stars by us.

<P>
In order to verify this theory, Dr. Extreme wants to build motion equations of super stars and
to compare the solutions ofthese equations with observed movements ofstars. As the first step,
he assumes that a super star is sphere-shaped, and has the smallest possible radius such that
the sphere contains all given stars in or on it. This assumption makes it possible to estimate
the volume of a super star, and thus its mass (the density of the invisible material is known).

<P>
You are asked to help Dr. Extreme by writing a program which, given the locations ofa number
of stars, finds the smallest sphere containing all of them in or on it. In this computation, you
should ignore the sizes of stars. In other words, a star should be regarded as a point. You may
assume the universe is a Euclidean space.

<P>Using the telephone pad for alphabetic input.<P>A telephone set has 12 buttons, as shown in the figure below (and some additional buttons, which are not relevant to this problem). On certain occasions (for example, when the user wishes to add a new name to the private phone directory stored in the telephone set) the telephone set is in alphabetical entry mode. In alphabetical entry mode, the user can enter a certain letter by pressing the corresponding digit key as many times as the position (in left-to-right order) of the desired letter on that particular key. For example, pressing the key 7 once means a 'P', whereas pressing the same key four times means an 'S'. The # key is used to separate successive letters. However, as shown by the examples to be given, pressing the # key between two letters may be omitted when it is clear where one letter ends and the next one begins.<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Telephone Keypad</B></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=3 BORDER FRAME=BOX RULES=GROUPS><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><TBODY><TR><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>1</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>2</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>3</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>ABC</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>DEF</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>4</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>5</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>6</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>GHI</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>JKL</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>MNO</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>7</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>8</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>9</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>PQRS</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>TUV</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>WXYZ</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P><UL><LI>The input, contains one or more lines, and each line contains one or more characters. </LI><LI>The only characters (in addition to end-of-line and end-of-file) that may appear in the input are the digits `<TT>2</TT>' through `<TT>9</TT>' and the pound character `<TT>#</TT>'.

Similarly, in the fourth line of the above input, removing the separator between the three 6's and the two 6's would not affect the output. More generally, in case of a long stream of 6's (or of any other digit other than 7 or 9) a separator could be inserted after every third 6 (starting from the left), without affecting the output. For example, 99996666666666666666 is equivalent to 9999666#666#666#666#666#6, which would produce the output ZOOOOOM.

<P>In World War II, Germany once used an electronic encryption machine called Enigma, which played a decisive role in the initial victories of Nazi Germany. It was proved to be one of the most reliable encryption systems in history. However, it was the blind trust on the reliability of the machine that brought about the doom of its user.<P>The structure of a one-rotor Enigma is shown as follows (the Enigma has only six keys):<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="484" HEIGHT="214" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2418a.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p2418a.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>The key element of the Enigma is the rotor, as shown in the second figure, which uses electronic circuits to transform plaintext (input from keyboard) into cryptograph (output on screen). When one key on the keyboard is pressed, the corresponding cryptograph is shown on screen. Then the rotor will automatically revolve a one-letter-step to a different position. The following figures illustrate how the rotor works when letter ``b" is pressed three successively times:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="440" HEIGHT="588" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2418a.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p2418b.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>When letter ``b" is pressed for the first time, the signal goes through the circuit and ``A" is shown on screen. When the key is released, the rotor revolves one-letter-step to a different position that changes all the corresponding circuits so that each letter now has a different cryptograph. When letter ``b" is pressed for the second time, the corresponding cryptograph is ``C". So when letter ``b" is pressed for the third time, the cryptograph is ``E" according to the principle specified above.<P>Now the following figure shows the structure of a two-rotor Enigma.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="770" HEIGHT="203" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2418a.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p2418c.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>The difference is that when a key is released, the second rotor won't revolve a step until the first one has finished one circle and returns to the original position. This is also the same in the case of three-rotor Enigma. That is: Only after the first rotor has finished one circle and return to the initial status, the second rotor will revolve a step.<P>And only after the second rotor has finish one circle, the third rotor will revolve a step.<P>However, how did the Allied Forces obtain the information encrypted by Enigma? A person named Hans-Thilo Schimdt was very essential. He acted as a spy and provided the initial status of the three rotors in each Enigma to the Allied Forces once a month. The Allied Forces thus got everything they wanted by deciphering the intercepted cryptograph using the information offered by the spy.<P>Now, please design a program to obtain the plaintexts using the information offered by the Allied Forces.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input file contains several test cases representing several three-rotor Enigmas.

<P>
The NTA (Non-deterministic Tree Automata) is a kind of tree structure device. The device is built in a set of operating rules. With these rules the device can produce several signals, which will form a signal system. In such a system, one signal is the starting signal, several signals are the acceptable signals, and the others are the auxiliary ones. A pair of signals is said to be an acceptable pair if both two signals of the pair are acceptable.

<P>
The trees discussed here are all binary trees. Every non-leaf node has two successors. In any finite tree, each node has a signal-transmitting element. When a signal arrives at one node, the signal meets the signal transmitting substance, and triggers off signal reactions, which will produce several pairs of signals. Then the device selects a pair of signals non-deterministically and sends them to its successors. The first signal in the signal pair is sent to the left successive node and the second one is sent to the right successive node. 

<P>
The whole operation for an NTA is as follows:

<P>
The device first sends the starting signal to the root node. According to the signal transmitting substance at the root node, the device selects a pair of signals non-deterministically and sends the first to the left son and the second to the right son. Each of the two signals then meets the signal transmitting substance at the corresponding node and produces another two signals. The course proceeds down until the signals arrive at the leaves. 

<P>
If a signal reaches one leaf and the leaf can produce a pair of acceptable signals, we say the leaf is ``shakable". A transmission of signals from the root to leaves is said to be valid if all leaves are ``shakable". A tree structure with signal transmitting substance is valid if there exists such a valid transmission. A tree is invalid if all the transmissions are invalid.

<P>
For simplicity, we denote the signal transmitting elements by consecutive lowercase letters ``a", ``b", ``c", etc.. The signals of an NTA are consecutive numbers <!-- MATH
 $0,1,2, \ldots$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">0, 1, 2,...</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and so on. The first signal 0 is always a starting signal. Thus the signals for a 4-signal NTA are ``0" ``1" ``2" and ``3". Accepting signals are arranged at the end of the number sequence so that if a 4-signal NTA has two accepting signals, the accepting signals are ``2" and ``3". The transition rules of signals are based on a transition table. For example, the following table describes a transition table with four signals ``0", ``1", ``2", ``3" and with three signal transmitting elements ``a", ``b" and ``c".

Mr. Ronald is responsible for the administration of the mainframe in ACM (Agent on Computing of Mathematics). The agent undertakes the mathematical computing jobs from some companies, and gain the rewards after has fulfilled the jobs on the mainframe. So the mainframe is very valuable to ACM. Mr. Ronald is required to arrange the order of those jobs running on mainframe. Once a job is to run, he examines the free resources for the job. If the resources meet the job's requirement, he assigns those resources to the job. Otherwise, the job will be suspended until there are enough resources.

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> should been counted. If the job hadn't been executed, it will not bring ACM any value, which means only punishment to the timeline should be calculated
Indeed, his programming ability is not good enough, and he does not like to compute manually. So he is uneasy about it. Could you help him to solve this problem?

Once upon a time, there lived Catherine Ironfist, the Queen of Enroth. One day, she received the news of her father's death. So she sailed for Erathia to attend her father's funeral. Fearing the worst, she assembled a military fleet as her escort. On reaching the coast of Erathia, Catherine found an allied wizard's tower, devastated from battle and abandoned. There she learned that a black-hearted knight poisoned her father using a goblet of wine, and Erathia was falling to the enemies. And then, she mustered local armies, and marched to Erathia's castle, restoring lost land along the way.

<P>
During the battles, she found that the equipments for the soldiers were in urgent need. And she knew clearly that the best equipments were made by the battle dwarf's workshop in the world. The workshop's equipments were well known for the firmness and top-quality. ``Cloak of the Undead King", ``Armor of the Damned", ``Angelic Helm" are the nonesuch ones. But unfortunately, the workshop was seated at the Erathia's castle, the territory under the enemy's control. So she sent a brave volunteer to come into the castle and asked for the workshop's help.

<P>
``It's our pleasure to help the righteous heroine." Rion, the leader of the workshop sent the message to Catherine, `` We haven't enough resources to build the nonesuch equipments. So we'll try to offer the ordinary equipments as more as possible. Still, those ones are much better the equipments made by other workshops. But we have faced a difficult problem. The castle is in a state of siege. The guards prohibited the equipments to be carried away from the castle. We have to ask for the trade caravans' help. As you know, each trade caravan's capability of carrying equipments is limited. If they had carried a little more, they would be detected by the guards, which would lead them into the prison. So you have to arrange how to carry these equipments."

<P>
The workshop would offer helms, armors and boots. These three ones had different defend capabilities. Also, their weight and size were different from each other. What's more, Rion had told Catherine that if armed with those three ones together, they would form a set of equipments, which might provide much more defend capability. As far as the trade caravan was concerned, each one had its special weight limitation and size limitation. Catherine had to make the decision on how to arrange the transportation plan to provide her soldiers as more defend capabilities as possible. Could you help her to finish the plan?

<P>Professor Maple teaches mathematics in a university. He have invented a function for the purpose of obtaining the operands from an expression. The function named <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>op</I>(<I>i</I>, <I>e</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> can be described as follows:<P>The expression <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>e</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> may be divided into sub-expression(s) by the operator, which has the lowest priority in the expression. For example, the expression `` <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I>*<I>b</I> + <I>b</I>*<I>c</I> + <I>c</I>*<I>d</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>" should be divided into three sub-expressions ``<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I>*<I>b</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>", ``<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I>*<I>c</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>" and ``<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I>*<I>d</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>", because the operator ``<SPAN CLASS="MATH">+</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>" has the lowest priority. The purpose of this function is to extract the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th sub-expression as the result.

<P>In a highly modernized fishing village, inhabitants there make a living on fishery. Their major tools, fishing nets, are produced and fixed by computer. After catching fishes each time, together with plenty of fishes, they will bring back the shabby fishing nets, which might be full of leaks. Then they have to inspect those nets. If there exist large leaks, they have to repair them before launching out again.<P>Obviously, the smaller the leaks in the fishing nets are, the more fishes they will catch. So after coming back, those fishermen will input the information of the fishing nets into the computer to check whether the nets have leaks. The checking principle is very simple: The computer regards each fishing net as a simple graph constructed by nodes and edges. In the graph, if any circle whose length (the number of edges) is larger than 3 must has at least one chord, the computer will output ``<TT>Perfect</TT>" indicating that the fishnet has no leaks. Otherwise, ``<TT>Imperfect</TT>" will be displayed and the computer will try to repair the net.<P><P><BR><B>Note:</B> A circle is a closed loop, which starts from one node, passes through other distinct nodes and back to the starting node.

<P>The classical Maya civilization prospered in what today is southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and northern Honduras. During the height of the Maya civilization they developed a sophisticated system for time keeping used both to record history and for divinatory rituals. Their calendar consisted of three components: the Tzolkin, the Haab and the Long Count.<P>For divinatory purposes the Maya used the Tzolkin which was composed of 20 day names to which a numeric coefficient from 1 to 13 was attached, giving a total of 260 distinct combinations. This is the size of the Tzolkin, or ritual year. From Spanish colonial sources, we know the names of the days:<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Day names</B>: I<SMALL>MIX, </SMALL>I<SMALL>K, </SMALL>A<SMALL>KBAL, </SMALL>K<SMALL>AN, </SMALL>C<SMALL>HIKCHAN, </SMALL>K<SMALL>IMI, </SMALL>M<SMALL>ANIK, </SMALL>L<SMALL>AMAT, </SMALL>M<SMALL>ULUK, </SMALL>O<SMALL>K, </SMALL>C<SMALL>HUEN, </SMALL>E<SMALL>B, </SMALL>B<SMALL>EN, </SMALL>I<SMALL>X, </SMALL>M<SMALL>EN, </SMALL>K<SMALL>IB, </SMALL>K<SMALL>ABAN, </SMALL>E<SMALL>TZNAB, </SMALL>K<SMALL>AWAK, </SMALL>A<SMALL>JAW</SMALL></BLOCKQUOTE><P>For example, the sequence of days starting at 9.I<SMALL>MIX</SMALL> is: 9.I<SMALL>MIX&nbsp;/ 10.</SMALL>I<SMALL>K&nbsp;/ 11.</SMALL>A<SMALL>KBAL&nbsp;/ 12.</SMALL>K<SMALL>AN&nbsp;/ 13.</SMALL>C<SMALL>HIKCHAN&nbsp;/ 1.</SMALL>K<SMALL>IMI&nbsp;/ 2.</SMALL>M<SMALL>ANIK&nbsp;/...</SMALL><P>The Haab calendar was used for astronomy. It had 365 days divided into 19 months each with 20 days, except the last one which had only 5. In a manner similar to the Tzolkin each month name has a number from 1 to 20 indicating the day number within the month. Again, from Spanish colonial sources, we know the names of the months:<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Month names</B>: P<SMALL>OHP, </SMALL>W<SMALL>O, </SMALL>S<SMALL>IP, </SMALL>Z<SMALL>OTZ, </SMALL>S<SMALL>EK, </SMALL>X<SMALL>UL, </SMALL>Y<SMALL>AXKIN, </SMALL>M<SMALL>OL, </SMALL>C<SMALL>HEN, </SMALL>Y<SMALL>AX, </SMALL>S<SMALL>AK, </SMALL>K<SMALL>EH, </SMALL>M<SMALL>AK, </SMALL>K<SMALL>ANKIN, </SMALL>M<SMALL>UAN, </SMALL>P<SMALL>AX, </SMALL>K<SMALL>AYAB, </SMALL>K<SMALL>UMKU, </SMALL>W<SMALL>AYEB</SMALL></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The month W<SMALL>AYEB</SMALL> had just 5 days and was considered an unlucky time of the year.<P>The Tzolkin and Haab were combined in the inscriptions to create the so called Calendar Round, combining the 260 day cycle of the Tzolkin and the 365 day cycle of the Haab. A typical Calendar Round date in the inscriptions might be: ``3.L<SMALL>AMAT 6.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX</SMALL>''. Note that not all of the combination of days, months and coefficients are possible. How many days does it take to repeat a Calendar Round?<P>A typical sequence of days in the Calendar Round starting for example at ``3.L<SMALL>AMAT 6.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX</SMALL>'':<BLOCKQUOTE>3.L<SMALL>AMAT&nbsp;6.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX&nbsp;/ 4.</SMALL>M<SMALL>ULUK&nbsp;7.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX&nbsp;/ 5.</SMALL>O<SMALL>K&nbsp;8.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX&nbsp;/ 6.</SMALL>C<SMALL>HUEN&nbsp;9.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX&nbsp;/ 7.</SMALL>E<SMALL>B&nbsp;10.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX&nbsp;/ 8.</SMALL>B<SMALL>EN&nbsp;11.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX&nbsp;/ 9.</SMALL>I<SMALL>X&nbsp;12.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX&nbsp;/ 10.</SMALL>M<SMALL>EN&nbsp;13.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX&nbsp;/ 11.</SMALL>K<SMALL>IB&nbsp;14.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX&nbsp;/ 12.</SMALL>K<SMALL>ABAN&nbsp;15.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX&nbsp;/ 13.</SMALL>E<SMALL>TZNAB&nbsp;16.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX&nbsp;/ 1.</SMALL>K<SMALL>AWAK&nbsp;17.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX&nbsp;/ 2.</SMALL>A<SMALL>JAW&nbsp;18.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX&nbsp;/ 3.</SMALL>I<SMALL>MIX&nbsp;19.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX&nbsp;/ 4.</SMALL>I<SMALL>K&nbsp;20.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX&nbsp;/ 5.</SMALL>A<SMALL>KBAL&nbsp;1.</SMALL>K<SMALL>AYAB&nbsp;/ 6.</SMALL>K<SMALL>AN&nbsp;2.</SMALL>K<SMALL>AYAB&nbsp;/ ...</SMALL></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Finally, at the beginning of the Classic Period (AD 200-900) the Maya developed an absolute calendar called Long Count which counted the number of days starting from a fixed date. Currently, most researchers agree that this zero date was August&nbsp;13, 3114&nbsp;BC. According to Maya belief this was the date of creation of our world. Dates in the Long Count are written (for simplicity) in 5-tuples of the form: ``9.2.3.4.5''. Such a date reads ``9 baktuns 2 katuns 3 tuns 4 winals 5 kin since the zero date''. A ``kin'' is just one day. A ``winal'' is a group of 20 days. A ``tun'' is a group of 18 winals (thus a tun has <i><b>20&times; 18</i></b> = 360 days, 5 days short of a year). From here on all units come in multiples of 20. Thus a ``katun'' is 20 tuns (almost 20 years) and a ``baktun'' is 20 katuns (almost 400 years). Thus the date ``9.2.3.4.5'' means `` <i><b>9&times; 144000 + 2&times; 7200 + 3&times; 360 + 4&times; 20 + 5</i></b> days after the zero date''.<P>Given the periodicity of the Calendar Round, a legal date such as ``3.L<SMALL>AMAT 6.</SMALL>P<SMALL>AX</SMALL>'' has multiple occurrences in the Long Count. Thus, one difficulty in reading Maya inscriptions is establishing the correspondence between a date given only in the Calendar Round and the absolute date in the Long Count. In this case, we must compute all the possible Long Count dates associated with the particular Calendar Round and deduce which one applies based on context information (for example, using references to a king whose lifespan is known).<P>Write a program that computes all possible Long Count dates corresponding to a given Calendar Round date. Only the Long Count dates in the Baktuns 8 and 9 are of interest to us (they cover all the Classic Period).<P>As a starting point, you are given the information that the Long Count date 8.0.0.0.0 occurred on the Calendar Round ``9.A<SMALL>JAW&nbsp;3.</SMALL>S<SMALL>IP</SMALL>''.<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><b>The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.

<P>Though it might be hard to imagine, the inhabitants of a small country Additivia do not know of such thing as change, which probably has to do with them not knowing subtraction either. When they buy something, they always need to have the exact amount of addollars, their currency. The only other option, but not a really attractive one, is over-paying.<P>Professor Adem, one of the Additivian mathematicians came up with an algorithm for keeping a balanced portfolio. The idea is the following. Suppose you have more coins of value <i><b>v<sub>1</sub></i></b> than coins of value <i><b>v<sub>2</sub></i></b>. In this case you should try to spend at least as many coins of value <i><b>v<sub>1</sub></i></b> as those of value <i><b>v<sub>2</sub></i></b> on any buy you make. Of course spending too many <i><b>v<sub>1</sub></i></b> coins is not a good idea either, but to make the algorithm simpler professor Adem decided to ignore the problem. The algorithm became an instant hit and professor Adem is now designing a kind of ``electronic portfolio'' with built-in Adem's algorithm. All he needs now is a software for these machines, that will decide whether a given amount of addollars can be paid using a given set of coins according to the rules of Adem's algorithm. Needless to say, you are his chosen programmer for the task.<P>Write a program that reads the description of a set of coins and an amount of addollars to be paid, and determines whether you can pay that amount according to Professor Adem's rules.<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><b>The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.

<P>Mrs Brown is teaching her pupils about money. At the moment, they are using dummy $5, $10 and $20 notes. Before a lesson starts, Mrs Brown arranges piles of different notes for the pupils so that each one has the same amount of money. The total number of notes in each pile does not exceed 100 notes. Then she takes one, and only one, note from one pupil's pile and puts it in the pile of another pupil. The pupils then have to work out which one has the most money, and which one has the least.

Marico, an eccentric explorer of the orient, wrote an extensive diary of his trips. He did not mean to encrypt them, but that is what people thought due to his unusual writing style. Marico's writings proceeded from left to right but wrote each word vertically, and used the 26 letters of the alphabet (upper case) only. For example, he wrote the following:

Marico's diary has been digitized for the sake of preserving it, but its content remained a mystery until his unique writing style was understood. The process of converting a large number of pages back was found to be tedious and risky for error-prone human volunteers, and the decision was taken to develop a software tool to perform the task instead.

<P>
Your task is to write a program for the purpose of converting pages of Marico's diary into the familiar way of writing such that: 

<P>

<OL>
<LI>words on the same line are separated by exactly one blank space, 
</LI>
<LI>width of the output text does not exceed a specified value,
</LI>
<LI>words are not to be broken between output lines, even if that means breaking the previous rule
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
For example, your program should convert the page of Marico's diary shown on the left to the text shown on the right when the width is bounded by 10 places.

<P>A number pattern is a sequence of two or more numbers that satisfies a certain rule. For instance, the sequence `` <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3, 5, 7, 9,...</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>" is a number pattern that starts with three and jumps by twos.

<P>Takeshi Castle was a Japanese game show that aired from 1986 to 1989 on the Tokyo Broadcasting System. It featured the esteemed Japanese actor Takeshi Kitano as a count who owns a castle and sets up impossible challenges for a volunteer army to get to him. The show has become a television hit around the world. An old fan of the show asked us for help with the design of a challenge, called <SPAN CLASS="textbf">Lily Pads</SPAN> (The <B>Lily Pads</B> challenge is to cross a body of cold water by jumping between circular discs, with legs tied together, without falling into the water.), to use as a game following the upcoming ICPC Finals. As a challenge cannot be suitable for a Takeshi Castle game unless it is biased against the volunteer army, your task is to write a program to <SPAN CLASS="textit">verify</SPAN> that a given placement of the discs will cause the majority of the volunteer army members to fail the challenge.

<P>The organizing committee of a popular charity fair in a small town wants to include walking races that can be run in a competitive format. The idea is that competitiveness will make the races more entertaining, attract more viewers and thus more contributions. The proposed new format is to divide the walkers into heats that are competitive; that is, the time difference between the first and last participants to arrive at finish line in each heat is as small as possible. The heats are then scheduled to run independently through the day of the fair. The organizers will provide us with information about the number of registered walkers along with the best available estimate of the times they take to finish the race course, the number of heats they can schedule and the maximum number of participants allowed in each heat.

In contemporary VLSI chip industry, the software tools used by electrical engineers perform many optimizations.
Your task is to implement one specific optimization of some chip design. Your tool is given an acyclic net of NAND
gates (NAND gate computes the negated conjunction of its inputs, i.e. the output value of the gate is 0 if and only
if its both input values are 1). The net is a part of already synthesized component and cannot be changed. All the
inputs of the net are connected to one signal x. The objective is to disconnect x from some inputs and to assign
constant signals 0 and/or 1 to those inputs in such a way that the function implemented by the design remains unchanged.

<p>
We say that an assignment of x's and/or 0's and/or 1's to the inputs of the net is optimal if the number of inputs
connected to x is the smallest possible but the net still computes the same function as if all the inputs were
connected to x.


<p>
<b>Example</b>

<p>
Look at the following design.

<P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2440a.jpg>
</center>

<p>
We can change it to the design with only one variable input, for example: 

<P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2440a.jpg>
</center>

<p>
(Observe that there are other ways of connecting the inputs to just one x and to some number of 0's and 1's that
implement the same function).


<p>
<b>Task</b>

<p>
Write a program which for each data set:
<blockquote>
<li>reads the description of the net,
<li>computes an optimal assignment of x's and/or 0's and/or 1's to the inputs of the net,
<li>writes the result.
</blockquote>



<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
<p>
The first line of the input contains exactly one positive integer d equal to the number of data sets, 1 &le; d &le; 20.
The data sets follow.

<p>
Each data set consists of two consecutive lines. The rst of those lines contains exactly two positive integers n
and m separated by single space, 1 &le; n &le; 100.000, 1 &le; m &le; 200.000. Integer n is the number of the net inputs
and integer m is the number of the gates in the net.

<p>
The second of those lines contains exactly 2m nonzero integers, separated by single spaces. The numbers on
positions 2j - 1 and 2j describe the signal sources for the inputs to gate j. The positive number s means the
output of gate s. The negative number s means the (-s)-th input to the net. The gates and the net inputs are
numbered starting from one. The input of each gate is connected to an input of the net or to an output of a gate
whose description occurred earlier in the sequence. Each net input is connected to at least one gate input. Each
gate output is connected to at least one gate input except the output of the last gate that is connected to the
output of the net.
<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
<p>
The output should consist of exactly d lines, one line for each data set. The line number i should contain the answer
to the i-th data set.

<p>
The answer to one data set should consist of a sequence of exactly k characters terminated by the end of line (with
no spaces in between). Each of those characters should be 0 (the digit `zero' ) or 1 (the digit `one') or x
(lower-case letter `x' ). The i-th symbol of the sequence denotes the assignment to the i-th input of the net.

<p>
If there are more than one optimal assignment then your program should output any of them (but only one).

In order for a building to have electricity, a power line must be connected from one of the underground cables to a power converter inside the building. Because of technical reasons, each power cable is a <SPAN CLASS="textit">loop</SPAN>, meaning that it is a long cable line that originates from a mini power station, runs through some regions in the city and then comes back to the same power station. It is known that each power cable connects to at least 2 and at most 500 buildings. A building may be connected to zero, one or more than one power cable. The electricity of a building connected to more than one power cable can be provided by any one power cable by properly setting its power converter. To have a better city view, it is required by the law that power converters can only be built inside the basements.<P><P><BR>During a <SPAN CLASS="textit">Typhoon</SPAN>, the local rain storm, the downtown of city T is flooded. The basements of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/2443img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>K</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/2443img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, buildings are filled with water. Fortunately, none of the mini power stations are damaged. Once a basement is flooded with rain water, its power converter is damaged and the building is out of electricity. Before fixing the power converter, we need to drain the water in the basement, which takes at least a long time. To make the situation worse, the power cables of city T are designed with the constraint that for each power cable, if it is connected with a damaged power converter, then none of the power converters connected to this power cable can be turned on. It is also impossible to disconnect the damaged power converts from the power cables. However, it is possible to properly set a power convert to get electricity from a power cable that carries electricity. After Typhoon, the City Electrical Power Company needs to know the total number of buildings that are out of electricity. Since the flood has made the traffics inside the city bad, the company cannot send people to survey. Fortunately, it is known by the company the buildings that are flooded in Typhoon since people from those buildings telephoned the company for help. Giving the original power line connection floor plans and the buildings that are flooded, your task is to calculate the total number of buildings that are currently out of electricity, including the ones that are originally not connecting to any power cable.<P><P><BR>For example, each circle in Figure 1 represents a building. Two concentric circles represents a flooded building. There are 9 buildings. Buildings 7 and 8 are flooded. Solid straight lines are power cables. There are 3 power cable lines. One connects buildings 0, 1 and 6. One connects buildings 1, 2, 3 and 7. The last one connects buildings 0, 1, 4, 5 and 8. Buildings 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 do not have electricity currently in this example.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="626" HEIGHT="639" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/2443img1.png ALT="\epsfbox{p2443.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input file consists of several test cases.

<P>Priority-driven scheduling approach is commonly used in modern computer opera- tion systems where the systems always execute the task with the highest priority. In priority-driven scheduling, a task with lower priority may be preempted by a ready task with a higher priority and resume later. A <SPAN CLASS="textit">ready task</SPAN> is a task ready to run as long as it gets the right to use CPU. A <SPAN CLASS="textit">periodic task</SPAN> is executed exactly once in every constant interval which is called a <SPAN CLASS="textit">period</SPAN>. For simplicity, we assume a periodic task is ready at the beginning of a period and the deadline is at the end of each period. It will be ready again at the beginning of the next period. Static-priority assignment states that the priorities of tasks are assigned in advance and do not change during task execution. A set of periodic tasks is said to be <SPAN CLASS="textit">feasible</SPAN> if every task finishes ex- ecution before its deadline. <SPAN CLASS="textit">Rate-Monotonic algorithm</SPAN> assigns a higher priority for a task with shorter period and is an optimal scheduling algorithm using static-priority assignment. It can also find a feasible schedule if there exists any scheduler using static-priority assignment that can find one. Given a set of periodic tasks with known constant execution times and periods, we are interested to know whether the set of task is feasible by a Rate-Monotonic scheduler and how many times the tasks are pre- empted before the schedule first repeats at the <SPAN CLASS="textit">hyperperiod</SPAN> which is defined to be the least common multiple of all task periods. Note that it may be too large to calculate the hyperperiod, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt; 2<SUP>64</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, in advance and too slow to check feasibility on every time unit. It would be easier and faster to simulate the problem using two priority queues, one for the ready and preempted tasks and the other for the tasks not ready. All tasks will become ready again at the beginning of next hyperperiod.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="698" HEIGHT="268" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2444.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p2444.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>Figure 2 shows that tasks <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> with execution times 1, 2, 3 and periods 3, 5, 15 respectively are feasible using the Rate-Monotonic scheduling algorithm since <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> finish execution at time 1, 3, 14 respectively. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is preempted by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> at time 6 and resume at time 7, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is preempted by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> at time 5 and resume at time 8, preempted again by task <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> at time 9 and resume at time 13.

<P>In decades, people have realized the significance of data communication. Most of the designs and analysis of communication networks usually model their topologies as graphical representations because many relevant problems of networks can be solved by using graph theoretic results.

A node <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is called a <SPAN CLASS="textit">hinge node</SPAN> if there exist two other nodes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>u</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> such that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I><SUB>G-w</SUB>(<I>u</I>, <I>v</I>) &gt; <I>d</I><SUB>G</SUB>(<I>u</I>, <I>v</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. It means that the distance between <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>u</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is increased after <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is removed from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Thus, a hinge node can be viewed as a critical node of the corresponding network and the failure of such a node will increase the communication cost to the remaining subnetwork. For example, we consider the network <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> in Figure 3. The node <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is a hinge node since <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I><SUB>G-v<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>(<I>v</I><SUB>8</SUB>, <I>v</I><SUB>9</SUB>) = 3 &gt; <I>d</I><SUB>G</SUB>(<I>v</I><SUB>8</SUB>, <I>v</I><SUB>9</SUB>) = 2</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Indeed, the set of hinge nodes contained in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is <SPAN CLASS="MATH">{<I>v</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>v</I><SUB>3</SUB>, <I>v</I><SUB>4</SUB>, <I>v</I><SUB>7</SUB>, <I>v</I><SUB>8</SUB>, <I>v</I><SUB>10</SUB>}</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.<P><P><BR>Suppose that we have several networks. Each network is connected and contains at most <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> nodes, where <!-- MATH

<P>To build a complex system, software engineering methods suggest building a design or prototype first before programming the real system. System correctness can be tested or verified on such a design (or a model) so that serious errors can be found in an earlier stage. As a result, software development cost and time can be significantly reduced.<P><P><BR>A design is often the abstract behaviors of the real system. Some representations, such as finite-state machines (FSM), are suitable for describing the abstract behaviors of a system. For example, if we want to build an oven system, we can first design a FSM in Figure 4 to represent the oven we intend to build. Then, we can check system correctness on the FSM.<P><P><BR>To define the correctness, we label every state of the machine with propositions {<SPAN CLASS="textbf">start,close,heat</SPAN>}. Each proposition at a state is either true or false. For instance, at state 1, all propositions are false, which means at this state the start button is not pressed, oven door is not closed, and oven is not heated. At state 3, proposition <SPAN CLASS="textbf">close</SPAN> is true, which means at the state, oven door is closed.<P><P><BR>An interesting problem is to ask if the FSM satisfies some properties. For example, we may want to ask ``<SPAN CLASS="textit">Can the oven <SPAN CLASS="textbf">never</SPAN> heat up after start button is pressed?</SPAN>" Let it be property A. If the FSM satisfies property A, we know the oven is a bad design and it must be fixed before being made into a product. To check if the FSM satisfies property A, it is equivalent to ask ``<SPAN CLASS="textit">if there exist some states that <SPAN CLASS="textbf">start</SPAN> is true and <SPAN CLASS="textbf">heat</SPAN> is never true along an infinite run which begins from the states.</SPAN>" In order to express the properties formally, we need the following notation.<P><P><BR>An <SPAN CLASS="textit">infinite sequence</SPAN> of states is a cycle or a path which finally goes into a cycle in a FSM. For example, see Figure 4. States 1, 2, 5 and 3 form a cycle and constitute an infinite sequence. States 7 and 4 constitute another infinite sequence since the path starts from state 7 and finally goes into the cycle which only contains state 4. Let <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>EG</I>(<I>p</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> denote the states which constitute some infinite sequences with proposition p being true along the sequences. For example, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>EG</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/2448img1.png ALT="$ \sim$"></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark><SPAN CLASS="textbf">heat</SPAN>) contains states 1, 2, 5 and 3.

Although subtraction and division in <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">F</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="MATH">(2<SUP>8</SUP>)</SPAN>

that subtraction in this field is the same as addition. They are all equivalent to the

In this problem, we are going to design a simplified tool to generate keys for TTM.
Your program needs only do two types of operations: (1) create a function, and (2)
compute the composition of functions.

<P>
Creating a function means to read a function definition from the input file and
store it properly. A function is defined in the input file as

defining a term. If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I> = 1</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the constant is omitted, except it is the only one in the term.

<P>
We assume that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I><SUB>k</SUB> &gt; 0</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and if the exponent <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I><SUB>k</SUB> = 1</SPAN>

range <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[0, 255]</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and expressed by at most two hexadecimal digits. To make it simple, no
parenthesis can be used in defining a function. For example, ``<!-- MATH

<p>Inhabitants of the Wonderland have decided to hold a regional programming contest. The Judging Committee has volunteered and has promised to organize the most honest contest ever. It was decided to connect computers for the contestants using a &quot;star&quot; topology - i.e. connect them all to a single central hub. To organize a truly honest contest, the Head of the Judging Committee has decreed to place all contestants evenly around the hub on an equal distance from it.</p><p>To buy network cables, the Judging Committee has contacted a local network solutions provider with a request to sell for them a specified number of cables with equal lengths. The Judging Committee wants the cables to be as long as possible to sit contestants as far from each other as possible.</p><p>The Cable Master of the company was assigned to the task. He knows the length of each cable in the stock up to a centimeter, and he can cut them with a centimeter precision being told the length of the pieces he must cut. However, this time, the length is not known and the Cable Master is completely puzzled.</p><p>You are to help the Cable Master, by writing a program that will determine the maximal possible length of a cable piece that can be cut from the cables in the stock, to get the specified number of pieces.</p><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><b>The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.

<p><img alt="Sample wall picture" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2453.gif style="float:right"></img> Once upon a time there was a greedy King who ordered his chief Architect to build a wall around the King's castle. The King was so greedy, that he would not listen to his Architect's proposals to build a beautiful brick wall with a perfect shape and nice tall towers. Instead, he ordered to build the wall around the whole castle using the least amount of stone and labor, but demanded that the wall should not come closer to the castle than a certain distance. If the King finds that the Architect has used more resources to build the wall than it was absolutely necessary to satisfy those requirements, then the Architect will loose his head. Moreover, he demanded Architect to introduce at once a plan of the wall listing the exact amount of resources that are needed to build the wall.</p><p>Your task is to help poor Architect to save his head, by writing a program that will find the minimum possible length of the wall that he could build around the castle to satisfy King's requirements.</p><p>The task is somewhat simplified by the fact, that the King's castle has a polygonal shape and is situated on a flat ground. The Architect has already established a Cartesian coordinate system and has precisely measured the coordinates of all castle's vertices in feet.</p><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><b>The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.

N (3 &le; N &le; 1000) is the number of vertices in the King's castle, and L (1 &le; L &le; 1000) is the minimal number of feet that King allows for the wall to come close to the castle.</p><p>Next N lines describe coordinates of castle's vertices in a clockwise order. Each line contains two integer numbers X<sub>i</sub> and Y<sub>i</sub> separated by a space (-10000 &le; X<sub>i</sub>, Y<sub>i</sub> &le; 10000) that represent the coordinates of i<sup>th</sup> vertex.

<p>Bill teaches chemistry in the school and has prepared a number
of tests for his students. Each test has a chemical formula and a number
of possible reaction outcomes that his students are to choose one
correct from. However, Bill wants to make sure that he has not
made any typos while entering his tests into a computer and that his
students won't easily throw away wrong answers simply by counting
a number of chemical elements on the left and on the right side of
the equation, which should be always equal in a valid reaction.</p>

<p>You are to write a program that will help Bill. The program
shall read the description of the test for the students that
consists of the given left side of the equation and a number of
possible right sides, and determines if the number of chemical
elements on each right side of the equation is equal to the
number of chemical elements on the given left side of the
equation.</p>

<p>To help you, poor computer folks, that are unaware of the
complex world of chemistry, Bill has formalized your task. Each side
of the equation is represented by a string of characters without
spaces, and consists of one or more chemical sequences separated
by a '+' (plus) characters. Each sequence has an optional
preceding integer multiplier that applies to the whole sequence
and a number of elements. Each element is optionally followed by an
integer multiplier that applies to it. An element in this equation
can be either distinct chemical element or a whole sequence
that is placed in round parenthesis.
Every distinct chemical element is represented by either one
capital letter or a capital letter that is followed by a small
letter.</p>

<p>Even more formally, using notation that is similar to BNF, we can write:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;formula&gt; ::= [&lt;number&gt;] &lt;sequence&gt; { '+' [&lt;number&gt;] &lt;sequence&gt; }</li>
<li>&lt;sequence&gt; ::= &lt;element&gt; [&lt;number&gt;] { &lt;element&gt; [&lt;number&gt;] }</li>
<li>&lt;element&gt; ::= &lt;chem&gt; | '(' &lt;sequence&gt; ')'</li>
<li>&lt;chem&gt; ::= &lt;uppercase_letter&gt; [ &lt;lowercase_letter&gt; ]</li>
<li>&lt;uppercase_letter&gt; ::= 'A'..'Z'</li>
<li>&lt;lowercase_letter&gt; ::= 'a'..'z'</li>
<li>&lt;number&gt; ::= '1'..'9' { '0'..'9' }</li>
</ul>

<p>Every distinct chemical element is said to occur in the given formula
for some total number X, if X is the sum of all separate occurrences
of this chemical element multiplied to all numbers that apply to it.
For example, in the following chemical formula:</p>

<p><tt>C2H5OH+3O2+3(SiO2)</tt></p>

<ul>
<li><tt>C</tt> occurs for a total of 2 times.</li>
<li><tt>H</tt> occurs for a total of 6 times (5 + 1).</li>
<li><tt>O</tt> occurs for a total of 13 times (1 + 3*2 + 3*2).</li>
<li><tt>Si</tt> occurs for a total of 3 times.</li>
</ul>

<p>All multipliers in the formula are integer numbers that are at least 2 if
explicitly specified and are 1 by default. Each chemical formula is at most 100
characters long, and every distinct chemical element is guaranteed to occur
for a total of no more than 10000 times in each formula.</p>

<p>
<p>The first line of the input file represents a chemical formula that is to

<b>
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

<p>
<p>
<p>You are to write to the output file N lines - one line per each possible
answer of the chemical test for Bill's students that is given in the
input file. For each right-hand side formula that is encountered in the
input file, write to the output file:</p>

<p><tt>&lt;left_formula&gt;==&lt;right_formula&gt;</tt></p>

<p>if the total number of occurrences of each distinct chemical element on the

chemical element on the right-hand side.
Otherwise write:</p>

<p><tt>&lt;left_formula&gt;!=&lt;right_formula&gt;</tt></p>

<p>Here <tt>&lt;left_formula&gt;</tt> must be replaced exactly (character by
character) with the original left-hand side formula as it is given in the first line

<p>Your team was hired by the international corporation ACM (Analytical Calculation Maxims). Every year ACM creates and conducts various surveys. Surveys themselves are simple forms with a list of questions and a list of possible answers for every question. Surveys are distributed around the globe, where field agents question the target group of people. All the answers are gathered in the ICPC (International Computation and Processing Center), where teams of well-paid analysts mine raw data in search for relevant correlations. The raw data for each individual survey consists of lots of lines of answers. Each line corresponds to every questioned person and for every question lists answers that the person has made on that particular survey.</p><p>The first step of analysis that your team was hired to automate is to create cross tables that correlate answers on interesting pairs of questions. In its most simple way, given a pair of questions, cross table has a row for every possible answer on the first question, and has a column for every possible answer on the second question. Each cell of the cross table contains a number of lines in the raw data that has both answers for the corresponding questions at the same time.</p><p>However, your task is complicated by the fact that you are to compute and output not only simple cross table values, but also total values for every row and column in the cross table (that is the sum of values in the corresponding row and column) that are placed in an additional last column and last row, as well as a percentage distributions for every row and column. Percentage distribution for a row is an additional number in every cell in that row that shows percent ratio of the value in that cell to the total value for that row, unless the total value is zero (in that case percentage distribution for this row is not defined). The same applies to the percentage distributions of columns. Thus, the cross table in your output will have at most three values in every cell (the value itself, row-wise percent, and column-wise percent). Please note, that percentage distributions also apply to totals. For example, in the total column for every row the row-wise percent will be always 100%, unless the total value for the row is zero (in that case row-wise percents are not defined), and column-wise percent shows percents ratio of the total value for this row to the total number of lines in the raw data (which is the value that can be found in the last column of the last row).</p><p>Percents are rounded to integers on output. Percent that has a non-zero fractional part is rounded to either the smallest integer number greater than the resulting percent, or the largest integer number smaller than the resulting percent, in such a way, that the sums of all corresponding row-wise percents by row (without row totals) or column-wise percents by column (without column totals) are equal to 100% unless they are undefined. There are various rounding algorithms that produce results satisfying the above constraints. You are free to use any rounding algorithm as long as the above constraints are satisfied.</p><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><b>The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.

Subsequent lines describe all the questions in the survey. On the first line of every question there is a 3-character question code (capital letters and digits only) followed by a space, and followed by the question name, which is at most 80 characters long. Each subsequent line for a question describes one possible answer on the question and starts with a space, followed by a single-character code for the answer (capital letter, digit, or character '.', '*', or '@'), followed by a space and followed by an answer description, which is at most 40 characters long. The list of questions is terminated by the line with a single character '#'. All answer codes are unique within the question, and all question codes are unique within the input file. There are at least 2 and at most 10 possible answers per question and at least 2 and at most 100 questions.</p><p>Next lines in the input file describe survey results. Every line contains a character per question (in the order they appear in the input file) that gives the answer code for the corresponding question. The characters follow one another without any delimiters. This section is terminated by the line with a single character '#'. There is at least one line with answers in the section and at most 10000 answers in total (the number of lines times the number of questions).</p><p>Next lines in the input file describe cross tables that are to be created. Each cross table description occupies one line. That line contains the code for the first question, followed by a space, followed by the different code for the second question, followed by a space, and followed by the cross table name, which is at most 100 characters long. This section is terminated by the line with a single character '#'. There are at most 100 cross table descriptions in the input file.</p><p>The input file has no trailing spaces on any line.

<p>Castaway Robinson Crusoe is living alone on a remote island. One day a ship carrying a royal library has wrecked nearby. Usually Robinson brings any useful stuff from the shipwreck to his island, and this time he has brought a big chest with books.</p><p><img alt="Sample library picture" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2456.gif style="float:right"></img> Robinson has decided to build a bookcase for these books to create his own library. He cut a rectangular niche in the rock for that purpose, hammered in wooden pegs, and placed wooden planks on every pair of pegs that have the same height, so that all planks are situated horizontally and suit to act as shelves.</p><p>Unfortunately, Robinson has discovered that one especially old and big tome does not fit in his bookcase. He measured the height and width of this tome and has decided to redesign his bookcase in such a way, as to completely fit the tome on one of the shelves, taking into account locations of other shelves and the dimensions of the niche. With each shelf in the bookcase, one of the following operations should be made:</p><ol><li>Leave the shelf on its original place.</li> <li>Move the shelf to the left or to the right.</li> <li>Shorten the shelf by cutting off a part of the plank and optionally move it to the left or to the right.</li> <li>Move one of the pegs to a different place at the same height and move the shelf to the left or to the right.</li> <li>Shorten the shelf by cutting off a part of the plank, move one of the pegs to a different place at the same height, and optionally move the shortened shelf to the left or to the right.</li> <li>Remove the shelf from the bookcase along with both supporting pegs.</li></ol><p>We say that the shelf is properly supported by its pegs, if exactly two distinct pegs support the shelf and the center of the shelf is between its pegs or coincides with one of the pegs. The original design of Robinson's library has all the shelves properly supported by their pegs and lengths of all shelves are integer number of inches. The Robinson may only cut an integer number of inches from the planks, because he has no tools for more precise measurements. All remaining shelves after the redesign must be properly supported by their pegs.</p><p>You are to find the way to redesign Robinson's library to fit the special old tome without changing original design too much. You have to minimize the number of pegs that are to be removed from their original places during the redesign (operations 4 and 5 remove one peg, and operation 6 removes two pegs). If there are different ways to solve the problem, then you are to find the one that minimizes the total length of planks that are to be cut off (operations 3 and 5 involve cutting something from the planks, and operation 6 counts as if cutting off the whole plank). Width of planks and diameter of pegs shall be considered zero.</p><p>The tome may not be rotated. The tome should completely (to all its width) stand on one of the shelves and may only touch other shelves, their pegs or niche's edge.</p><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><b>The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.

In a polygon tiling game, you are required to fill a polygon with a set of basic shapes 
called ``tiles". This is equivalent to cutting up the entire polygon into a number of small 
pieces; each piece must have exactly the same shape as one of the provided tiles. Let us 
consider a simple version of the game. Two types  of rectangular tiles are given as 
shown in Figure 2.1. Their width/height are 1/3 and 3/1 respectively. You are asked to 
use these two types of tiles to tile a rectilinear polygon (that is, a polygon with only 
vertical or horizontal edges). For instance, Figure 2.2(a) shows such a polygon and 
Figure 2.2(b) shows how it can be properly tiled with three 3<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>x</TT></SPAN>1 tiles and one 1<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>x</TT></SPAN>3 tile.

The coordinate system used in this game is described by the following rules:  

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(1)</DT>
<DD>A polygon is always positioned in such a way that its lowest edge is on the 
         <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>-axis and its leftmost edge is on the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>-axis, as shown in Figure 2.2. 
</DD>
<DT>(2)</DT>
<DD>A polygon is represented by an ordered list of points that enumerates all of its 
         vertices. The enumeration starts from the lower-left vertex and proceeds 
         counter-clockwise. For instance, the polygon in Figure 2.2(a) is represented 
         by the set of points {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H}. 
</DD>
<DT>(3)</DT>
<DD>A grid (a rectangle whose width and height are both 1) is represented by a pair 
         <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>)</SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> are the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>-coordinate and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>-coordinate of its top-right 
         vertex. In Figure 2.2(a), the coordinate of every grid is indicated inside the 
         grid. 
</DD>
<DT>(4)</DT>
<DD>A tile is designated by a triple <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I>)</SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> are the coordinates of 
the middle grid of the tile and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I></SPAN> represents the orientation of the tile. If the tile is 
horizontal, then <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I> = 0</SPAN>; otherwise, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I> = 1</SPAN>. Figure 2.3 gives two examples.

<P>Molecular biologists frequently compare bio-sequences to see if any similarities can be found in the hope that what is true of one sequence is also true of its analogue. In this problem, we focus on nucleic acid sequences that are composed of four symbols `A', `C', `G' or `T'. Generally, such comparisons involve aligning sections of the two sequences in a way that exposes the similarities between them. Given a query sequence and a set of sequences stored in a database, you are asked to write a program that searches the database and finds the sequence having the largest similarity score with the query sequence.<P>The similarity score between the query sequence and a database sequence is the sum of the alignment scores of the aligned pairs of symbols from an alignment of the two sequences. Two identical symbols that are aligned are given a score of +5 while a mismatched pair of symbols is assigned a score of -4. A gap is introduced into an alignment if one symbol in one sequence is not aligned with symbols in the other. The penalty for a gap is a score of -7. For example, given a query sequence <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>=`<TT>GAAGGCA</TT>' and a database sequence <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>=`<TT>GCAGAGCA</TT>', the following alignment between them (aligned pairs of symbols are written one above the other) has a similarity score of 5+(-4)+5+5+(-7)+5+5+5=21.<P><PRE><TT>

You work on a submarine and have just received an updated version of the submarine's 
manual, which is several gigabytes in size. The captain does not want the crew to waste 
time leafing through the new version to figure out how it differs from the one they read 
in training. On the other hand, she would hate to accidentally launch a missile when 
trying to turn on the microwave. As the expert programmer on board, you are assigned 
the task of comparing the old and new versions and marking how they differ from each 
other. For this task, the captain graciously provides you with a highlighter and lots of 
coffee. 

<P>
You have a better idea.  Since both versions are available in electronic form, you 
think of writing a program to compare them automatically.  The manual is organized 
hierarchically in volumes, chapters, sections, subsections, paragraphs, etc., so you 
model it using a tree structure.  All you need to do now is to write a program that takes 
two trees and produces a description of how they differ.

We use the term tree to mean a rooted, ordered, labeled tree, such as those 
depicted in Figure 4a.  The node number in the figure is used to identify a node and is 
indicated within the circle representing the node. Each node in a tree also has a label, 
which is indicated next to that node in the figure (numbers which are not bold and 
enclosed in parentheses or square brackets).  For this problem, we assume that labels 
are real numbers.  For example, the label of node 4 is 4.4. Note that the numbers, 
which are bold and enclosed in parentheses and square brackets in T1 and T2, are 
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">deletion</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">insertion</SPAN> costs of the nodes respectively and shall be explained later.  
Each node except the root also has a unique parent node.  In the figure, we connect a 
node to its parent (depicted above the node) using a line. For example, the parent of 
node 7 is node 1. The children of each interior node are ordered, and the figure depicts 
the children of each node left-to-right in this order. For example, the children of node 2, 
in order, are 3, 4, and 6.  

<P>
All the nodes that lie on the path (of length zero or more) from a node to the root 
are called the node's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ancestors</SPAN>. Note that every node is its own ancestor. If a node <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> 
is the ancestor of node <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>, then <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> is called a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">descendant</SPAN> of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>. The tree 
consists of all the 
descendants of a node <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> is called its <SPAN  CLASS="textit">subtree</SPAN>. The length of the path from a node to the 
root is called the node's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">depth</SPAN>. Thus, the depth of the root is always 0. In our example, 
the depth of node 4 is 2. 

<P>
The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">preorder list</SPAN> of a tree consists of the root followed by the preorder list of the 
subtrees rooted at its children, in order. For example, the preorder list of tree T1 is (1, 2, 
3, ..., 9). The preorder list of tree T2 is (13, 11, 14, 15, 19, 12, 16, 17, 18). 

<P>
Given such a tree, we can  <SPAN  CLASS="textit">edit</SPAN> (modify) it using the following three kinds of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">edit 
operations</SPAN>: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>An <SPAN  CLASS="textit">update operation</SPAN> can be used to change the label of a node. For example, we 
        can change the label of node 3 to 3.41 by using the operation <!-- MATH
 $upd(3, 3.41)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>upd</I> (3, 3.41)</SPAN>. That 
        is, the operation <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>upd</I> (<I>n</I>, <I>l</I> )</SPAN> changes the label of node <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>l</I></SPAN>.  
</LI>
<LI>A  <SPAN  CLASS="textit">delete operation</SPAN> can be used to remove any subtree from a given tree. For 
        example, we can remove the subtree rooted at node 4 by using the operation 
        <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>del</I> (4)</SPAN>. That is, the operation  <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>del</I> (<I>n</I>)</SPAN> applied to any tree containing all of  <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>'s 
        descendants (including <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>) from the tree. 
</LI>
<LI>An <SPAN  CLASS="textit">insert operation</SPAN> can be used to attach one tree to another tree. Refer to the 
        trees T* and T3 in Figure 4b. T* can be attached as the second child of the node 
       2 in T3 by using the <!-- MATH
 $ins(T*, 2, 2)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ins</I>(<I>T</I>*, 2, 2)</SPAN>. That is, the operation <!-- MATH
 $ins(T, n, i)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ins</I>(<I>T</I>, <I>n</I>, <I>i</I>)</SPAN> makes T the 
        <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ith</SPAN> child of node <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
An <SPAN  CLASS="textit">edit script</SPAN> is a sequence of such edit operations. An edit script is applied to a 
tree by applying the operations one after another in the order they are listed.  Figure 4b 
depicts the edit script <!-- MATH

to tree T2 (except for node identifiers). We say that our <SPAN  CLASS="textit">edit script transforms</SPAN> T1 to T2. 

<P>
Each edit operation has a cost associated with it as described below: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cost of an update operation</SPAN> is simply the absolute value of the difference 
             between the old and new labels. Thus, updating a label 1.11 to 1.12 costs 0.01 
             units and updating a label 9.99 to 99.9 costs 89.91 units. 
</LI>
<LI>Each node has a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">deletion cost</SPAN> that depends on its label and that is specified as 
             part of the input. In Figure 4a (T1), the deletion cost of a node is indicated in 
             parentheses next to the node. If no such number appears next to a node, its 
     deletion cost is 1 unit by default. The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cost of a delete operation</SPAN> is the sum of the 
             costs of deleting all the nodes in the deleted subtree. For example, the operation 
             <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>del</I> (4)</SPAN> in our example costs 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 units.  
</LI>
<LI>Similarly, each node has an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">insertion cost</SPAN> that depends on its label and that is 
             specified as part of the input. In Figure 4a (T2), the insertion cost of a node is 
             indicated in square brackets next to the node. If no such number appears next 
     to a node, its insertion cost is 1 unit by default. The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cost of an insert operation</SPAN> 
is the sum of the insertion costs of all the nodes in the inserted subtree. For example, using the costs indicated in Figure 4a, the cost of the operation <!-- MATH
 $ins(T*2, 2)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ins</I>(<I>T</I>*2, 2)</SPAN> in earlier example is 4.4 + 0.13 = 4.53 units.

<LI>The cost of inserting or deleting a node whose label does not appear in any of 
       the input trees is 1 unit by default. Note that to avoid cluttering the insertion 
       and deletion costs of the nodes are not displayed in Figure 4b. 
</LI>
<LI>The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cost of an edit script</SPAN> is the sum of the costs of the operations it contains.

<P>
Your goal is to write a program that takes as input two trees (and the node 
insertion and deletion costs) and produces as output the cost of a minimum-cost edit 
script that transforms one tree to another. (You need not compute such a 
minimum-cost edit script; you only need its cost.) As was the case for the trees in 
Figure 4a, there is no correspondence between the node identifiers in the two trees; 
thus they are not specified in the input. You are also required to pretty-print the input 
trees as described below. 

<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2> 

<P>
The input file first lists the nodes in the first tree in preorder, one per line. For each 
node, the input file contains a line with three numbers that are separated using spaces. 
The first number is the depth of the node. The second is the node's label. The third is 
that node's deletion cost. After all the nodes in the first tree are listed in this manner, 
the input file contains a line <TT>"-1 0 0"</TT> to denote the end of the tree's listing.  

<P>
Next, the input contains a blank line followed by a listing of the second tree. The 
second tree is listed using the method described above, the only difference being that 
the third number on each line is now the node's insertion cost. This listing of the nodes 
in the second tree is also followed by a line <TT>"-1 0 0"</TT> to denote the end of the listing. 

<P>
Assume that all real numbers in the input are in the range [0, 99.99] (inclusive).  

<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2> 

<P>
The output consists of two parts. First, you pretty-print the two input trees. Second, 
you report the cost of a minimum-cost edit script that transforms the first tree to the 
second.  

<P>
You must first output the first tree by listing one node per line, in preorder. Each 
such line must begin with 4d space characters, where d is the depth of the node. Next, it 
contains the node's label, with two digits before and two digits after the decimal point. 
If the label is less than 10, include a leading space character. Thus, 9.87 is output as 
`<TT>?9.87</TT>' where `<TT>?</TT>' denotes the ASCII space character.  This label is followed by a 
single space character, followed by the node's deletion cost listed in the same format as that 
used for the label. 

<P>
Next, you must output a blank line, followed by the listing of the second tree in the 
above format (with the deletion cost replaced by the insertion cost). 

<P>
Finally, you output a blank line followed by a line containing the string 
`<TT>Distance:</TT>' followed by a space character followed by the cost of the minimum-cost 
edit script. For outputting this cost, use the same format you used for the tree labels. 
(You can assume that the cost will always be a real number in the range [0, 99.99].) 

<P>
Do not include anything else in your output, not even blank lines. 

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<B>Note:</B> For the tree depicted in Figure 4a, the input and output are shown below. (For clarity, 
we use the `<TT>?</TT>' symbol to denote the ASCII space character.) Note that the space 
characters at the beginning of lines in the input are optional; your program should 
work whether or not they occur in the input. As it turns out, the edit script depicted in 
Figure 4b is a minimum-cost edit script for this input, and its cost is 6.28, as reported 
in the output.

To facilitate the shipping of certain hazardous materials, a shipping company has come 
up with the idea of introducing variable sized containers. The volume of each container 
is an integer in some unit and because of the nature of the content, each container must 
be completely filled before it can be used to transport the goods. The company has 
determined that since the handling cost of each container is the same irrespective of 
the size, it will charge the customers according to the number of containers hired. This 
policy then provides an incentive for the customer to choose the minimum possible 
number of containers for a given volume of goods.   

<P>
To make the task of choosing the minimum number easier, the shipping company 
is looking into selecting a set of container sizes such that the minimum number of 
containers for any given volume can be obtained by choosing the largest possible sizes 
first.  Any set of container sizes that satisfies this property will be designated as 
acceptable; otherwise, it is unacceptable.  For example, the set 10, 6, 3, 1 is 
unacceptable because for a volume of 12 units, choosing the largest possible sizes first 
will result in the combination 10+1+1 with a count of 3 containers; whereas, the 
combination 6+6 requires 2 containers only.  Your task is to write a program that will 
determine whether a given set of container sizes is acceptable or not acceptable.

</H2> 

<P>
The input format will be one line per container set. Each line will contain the number 
of container sizes in the set, followed by each size value in descending order. The 
maximum number of container sizes will be 20, and the minimum 1.  The smallest size 
will be 1 and the largest is 200. Your algorithm should be valid for any integral volume 
of goods without any upper limit.  The end of file is denoted by a container size set with 
zero sizes.

<P>A community named DAMPU lives in the twenty first century. However it still follows some of its old outdated traditional community customs very strictly, even though its members are used to modern way of life and use modern gadgets including computers for its activities and recreations.<P>The DAMPU community is closed in the sense that marriages take place according to the old custom between a male and a female member of the community. A member of the community is not permitted to marry outside the community. Further, members of the community are monogamous. Each unmarried living member having a specified marriageable age is eligible for marriage. An eligible member of the community can marry another eligible member of opposite sex if and only if, at least one of them is separated from the nearest common ancestor by at least <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> generations, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> being an integer specified by the community council from time to time. The integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> is called the <SPAN CLASS="textit">generation gap</SPAN>. For example if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> = 2</SPAN> then the nearest common ancestor should be either grand parents of at least one of the two members who wish to marry or ancestors of grand parents. It may be noted that the members who are already married may or may not have a <SPAN CLASS="textit">generation gap</SPAN> of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> generations because a different criterion was possibly applicable at the time when they were married.<P>The DAMPU community wants to develop a computer program for computer based match making so that a member eligible for marriage may easily get a list of eligible members of the opposite sex with whom there is a possibility of marriage. It is known that the DAMPU community maintains a register for births, deaths and marriages and the records are available for every member of the community.<P>Can you help the DAMPU community by writing a program for the purpose stated above?<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input may contain multiple test cases.<P>For each test case, the first line contains three integers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>.

<P>A new township has been built over a rectangular plot of land dividing the whole area by a grid. The grid divides the whole plot into <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>m</I> - 1) <TT>x</TT> (<I>n</I> - 1)</SPAN> big square plots for use as residential / commercial / industrial areas. Each square plot is divided into smaller plots and these are well connected by internal road network. However, the major road links in the township connecting all big square plots are the avenues running along the grid with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>n</I></SPAN> junctions. The junctions are assumed to be arranged in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> rows and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> columns and are denoted by <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>p</I>, <I>q</I>), <I>p</I> = 1, 2,..., <I>m</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I> = 1, 2,..., <I>n</I></SPAN>. For an internal junction <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>p</I>, <I>q</I>)</SPAN>, the neighboring junction <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>p</I> - 1, <I>q</I>)</SPAN> is assumed to be at the north of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>p</I>, <I>q</I>)</SPAN>. In addition to the road network of the township there is a rectangular perimeter road that runs around the township with connections from each road junction located at the boundary of the township. An outline of the road links in the township is shown below where the perimeter road is indicated by the rectangle drawn around the network and a road junction at <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>p</I>, <I>q</I>)</SPAN> with directions to four roads going out of the junction are indicated by<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="102" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2469a.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p2469a.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="767" HEIGHT="548" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2469a.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p2469b.eps}"></DIV><P>The traffic control department of the township enforces static traffic control rules that either permit or do not permit traffic out of a road junction in a given direction. At each road junction there are four traffic signals, one facing each of the four roads connected at the junction. Each of these signals is lighted either Green or Red according to whether traffic is or is not permitted <SPAN CLASS="textit">out of the junction</SPAN>. A traffic in the perimeter road is permitted to enter the township through a road junction connecting the perimeter road if the traffic signal at the junction facing the perimeter road, is lighted Green.<P>It is generally believed that moving along the perimeter road is more risky than moving along the township avenues. It is also believed that the risk while moving from a source junction to a neighboring destination junction in the township avenues is same whatever be the location of the junctions. Let this risk be <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN>. The risk is additive in the sense that if one moves from a source junction to a destination junction through the township avenues, passing through <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> - 1</SPAN> other junctions then the risk is equal to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>kR</I></SPAN>. When the perimeter road is used to move from a junction to another junction separated by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> - 1</SPAN> other junctions ion the boundary of the township then the risk increases by a constant factor <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>f</I></SPAN> and the risk is equal to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>fkR</I></SPAN>, where f is a real constant that depends on the time of journey. In addition, for moving along the corners of the perimeter road there is an additional risk, it is estimated to be <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>fR</I></SPAN> for each corner. Let the total risk in moving along a rout be denoted by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>FR</I></SPAN>. The factor <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>F</I></SPAN> is called the risk factor of the rout.<P>As an illustration it may be pointed out that the risk for moving from (1,2) to (2,1) is <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>R</I></SPAN> if the movement is through the rout (1,2), (1,1), (2,1). So the risk factor <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>F</I></SPAN> of this rout is equal to 2. However, the risk becomes <SPAN CLASS="MATH">4<I>fR</I></SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(= 2<I>fR</I> + 2<I>fR</I>)</SPAN> if one moves along the rout (1,2), perimeter, (2,1) crossing the corner of the perimeter road once. In this case if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>f</I></SPAN> is defined to be 2.5 then the risk factor <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>F</I></SPAN> is equal to 10.0.<P>Given a source junction <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>a</I>, <I>b</I>)</SPAN> and a destination junction <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>c</I>, <I>d</I> )</SPAN> when certain traffic control rules are under operation and the constant <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>f</I></SPAN> is known, the problem is to find the total number s of the safest routs to move from the source to the destination and determine the risk factor <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>F</I></SPAN> associated with the safest routs.<P>Write a program to solve this problem.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input may contain multiple test cases.<P>For each test case, the first line contains the case number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN>, the total number of rows <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>, and columns <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>, the total number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I></SPAN> of source, destination pair for each of which the safest routs are to be found and the constant factor <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>f</I></SPAN>.<P>Each of the next <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I></SPAN> lines gives <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I>, <I>b</I>, <I>c</I>, <I>d</I></SPAN> indicating the {source <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>a</I>, <I>b</I>)</SPAN> , destination <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>c</I>, <I>d</I> )</SPAN>} pair for which the safest routs are to be found.<P>The traffic signals at <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>n</I></SPAN> junctions are given in row major order of the junctions in the next <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>n</I></SPAN> lines.

The successful launching of third-generation (3G) mobile phone by the Japanese giant
DoCoMo marked the beginning of an era in real-time multi-media inter-net communications at
affordable cost. The F-TV or the Future TV has the reputation to venture into innovative TV
programs that might attract large number of viewers in near future. In order to remain ahead in
the race to have the largest number of viewers during a prime time slot in comparison to other TV
channels, the management of F-TV plans to produce a TV program that will provide a large
number of viewers with an opportunity to chat with a celebrity either in person or in real-time
virtually using mobile phones and get cash prizes in the process. 

<P>
The planned TV program consists in having a celebrity on each show as the anchor of
the chat show and a selected number of viewers as 'real' participants. Any number of remote
viewers may also join the program during the show as 'virtual' participants using their 3G mobile
phones from anywhere in the world. Each participant, male or female, real or virtual, is enrolled
for the show and is given a unique token serial number on first come first served basis. Towards
the end of the show the anchor runs a computer program that selects participants from among
the enrolled participants and announces cash prizes for the selected participants. There is a
possibility that no participant is selected for a prize; in such a case the anchor announces the
decision accordingly.

<P>
The computer program selects the participants to get prizes in a simple way. Let n be the
total number of participants, real or virtual. Each participant is given a token serial number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>, <!-- MATH
 $p=1,
2, \ldots, n$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I> = 1, 2,..., <I>n</I></SPAN>. Let <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I><SUB>p</SUB></SPAN>, be equal to 0 if the participant having the token serial number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>, is female,
otherwise <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I><SUB>p</SUB></SPAN> is equal to 1. The input to the program is the string <!-- MATH
 $x=(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n})$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I> = (<I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB>,..., <I>x</I><SUB>n</SUB>)</SPAN> of length <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> on the alphabet {0,1}. The program finds the longest palindromes contained in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> ( i.e. the longest
sub-strings made up of elements of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> each of which reads the same backward as forward). Let
there be <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> such palindromes and let <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>U</I></SPAN> be the union of all these palindromes. The program
deletes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>U</I></SPAN> from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>. It repeats the process with the reduced string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> successively until there is no
palindrome of length 3 or more. Finally it finds the elements of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>, if any, which are retained in the
process.

<P>
For example, let <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> = 37</SPAN> and <!-- MATH
 $x=( 0110 \ 1110 \ 1101 \ 1011 \ 0111 \ 0101 \ 1101 \ 0010 \ 0101 \ 1 )$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I> = (0110&nbsp;1110&nbsp;1101&nbsp;1011&nbsp;0111&nbsp;0101&nbsp;1101&nbsp;0010&nbsp;0101&nbsp;1)</SPAN>
where the elements of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> are written in groups of four followed by a blank character, for easy
readability. The sub-string <!-- MATH
 $(x_{3}, \dots, x_{22})=( 10 \ 1110 \ 1101 \ 1011 \ 0111 \ 01 )$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>3</SUB>,..., <I>x</I><SUB>22</SUB>) = (10&nbsp;1110&nbsp;1101&nbsp;1011&nbsp;0111&nbsp;01)</SPAN> is of length 20 and is the
longest palindromes in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>. If this sub-string is deleted then the string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> is reduced to <!-- MATH
 $( x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{23},
x_{24}, \dots, x_{37} )$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB>23</SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB>24</SUB>,..., <I>x</I><SUB>37</SUB>)</SPAN> with elements <!-- MATH
 $( 0101 \ 1101 \ 0010 \ 0101 \ 1 )$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(0101&nbsp;1101&nbsp;0010&nbsp;0101&nbsp;1)</SPAN> which when reduced further gives <!-- MATH
 $( x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{23},x_{24} )$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB>23</SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB>24</SUB>)</SPAN> with elements <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(0101)</SPAN>. Finally, since the longest palindromes in <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(0101)</SPAN> are <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(010)</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(101)</SPAN> , each of which is of length 3 and their union is the entire string under consideration, all the
four elements are deleted. Hence, no element of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> is selected.

<P>There is a search around the world for the most wanted man (MWM) in the history of mankind. He is believed to have an extraordinary quality, either superior or inferior, compared to a normal person. He is likely to be present any where in the world. If he is spotted precisely then he may be captured without much difficulty. However the problem is in spotting him because a number of look-alikes are known to exist at different parts of the world.<P>Apart from conventional resources, modern satellite communication and surveillance systems that can precisely identify, measure, record and monitor the physical, social, cultural and behavioral characteristics of a person, are available for collecting data on the MWM. In addition, the services of competent professionals in different disciplines are available to analyze and interpret data collected from all sources.<P>Professional Psychologists and Statisticians admit that it is difficult for them to distinguish precisely between two persons using physical and behavioral data. However, by analyzing and interpreting group data, they claim that they can differentiate precisely between a group of normal persons and a similar group of same size that includes a person of extraordinary quality even if it is <SPAN CLASS="textbf">not known</SPAN> in advance whether the extraordinary quality is superior or inferior to that of a normal person. In such a case for a reliable comparison it is necessary that the number of persons in each group is 3 or more.<P>In other words, let A, B be two groups of equal number of persons, the number being 3 or more.

<P>Phil Oracle has a unique ability that makes him indispensable at the National Spying Agency. His colleagues can bring him any new binary code and he can tell them immediately whether the code is uniquely decodable or not. A code is the assignment of a unique sequence of characters (a codeword) to each character in an alphabet. A binary code is one in which the codewords contain only zeroes and ones. For example, here are two possible binary codes for the alphabet {a,c,j,l,p,s,v}.<p><table align=center cellspacing=0 border=1 cellpadding=3><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Code 1</td><td>Code 2</td></tr><tr><td>a</td><td>1</td><td>010</td></tr><tr><td>c</td><td>01</td><td>01</td></tr><tr><td>j</td><td>001</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>l</td><td>0001</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>p</td><td>00001</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>s</td><td>000001</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>v</td><td>0000001</td><td>101</td></tr></table><p>The encoding of a string of characters from an alphabet (the cleartext) is the concatenation of the codewords corresponding to the characters of the cleartext, in order, from left to right. A code is uniquely decodable if the encoding of every possible cleartext using that code is unique. In the example above, Code 1 is uniquely decodable, but Code 2 is not. For example, the encodings of the cleartexts "pascal" and "java" are both 001010101010. Even shorter encodings that are not uniquely decodable are 01 and 10.</p><p>While the agency is very proud of Phil, he unfortunately gives only "yes" or "no" answers. Some members of the agency would prefer more tangible proof, especially in the case of codes that are not uniquely decodable. For this problem you will deal only with codes that are not uniquely decodable. For each of these codes you must determine the single encoding having the minimum length (measured in bits) that is ambiguous because it can result from encoding each of two or more different cleartexts. In the case of a tie, choose the encoding which comes first lexicographically.</p><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>One or more codes are to be tested. The input for each code begins with an integer m, (1<= m<=20),
 on a line by itself, where m is the number of binary codewords in the code. This is followed by m lines
 each containing one binary codeword string, with optional leading and trailing whitespace. No codeword

<P>In this problem, you will compute how much food you need to purchase for a trip across the desert on foot.</p><p>At your starting location, you can purchase food at the general store and you can collect an unlimited amount of free water. The desert may contain oases at various locations. At each oasis, you can collect as much water as you like and you can store food for later use, but you cannot purchase any additional food. You can also store food for later use at the starting location. You will be given the coordinates of the starting location, all the oases, and your destination in a two-dimensional coordinate system where the unit distance is one mile.</p><p>For each mile that you walk, you must consume one unit of food and one unit of water. Assume that these supplies are consumed continuously, so if you walk for a partial mile you will consume partial units of food and water. You are not able to walk at all unless you have supplies of both food and water. You must consume the supplies while you are walking, not while you are resting at an oasis. Of course, there is a limit to the total amount of food and water that you can carry. This limit is expressed as a carrying capacity in total units. At no time can the sum of the food units and the water units that you are carrying exceed this capacity.</p><p>You must decide how much food you need to purchase at the starting location in order to make it to the destination. You need not have any food or water left when you arrive at the destination. Since the general store sells food only in whole units and has only one million food units available, the amount of food you should buy will be an integer greater than zero and less than or equal to one million.</p><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>The first line of input in each trial data set contains n (2 <= n <= 20), which is the total number

the n significant locations. The first significant location is the starting point, where your food supply
 must be purchased; the last significant location is the destination; and the intervening significant

<P>Millions of years ago massive fields of ice carved deep grooves in the mountains of Norway. The sea filled these grooves with water. The Norwegian people call them fjords. This landscape of mountains and water is beautiful, but it makes traveling difficult. The usual scheme is: drive some kilometers, wait for a ferry, cross a fjord with the ferry, drive some more kilometers, and so on until the destination has been reached. To reach a destination as early as possible, most people have the following strategy: drive as fast as allowed (the maximum speed is 80 km/h) to the next ferry, and wait until it goes. Repeat until the destination has been reached.</p><p>Since driving fast requires more fuel than driving slow, this strategy is both expensive and harmful to the environment. The new generation of cruise control systems is designed to help. Given the route you want to go, these systems will gather information about the ferries involved, calculate the earliest possible time of arrival at the final destination, and calculate a driving scheme that avoids driving faster than needed. The systems will calculate your road speed so that you board the next ferry the moment it leaves.</p><p>Given a route (a sequence of road-pieces and crossings with ferries), you must write a program to calculate the minimal time it takes to complete this route. Moreover, your program must find a driving scheme such that the maximal driving speed at any point during the trip is as small as possible.</p><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>The input file contains one or more test cases. Each test case describes a route. A route consists of several sections, each section being either a piece of road or a crossing. The first line in the description contains a single number s (s > 0), which is the number of sections in the route. The next s lines contain the descriptions of the sections. Every line describing a section starts with two names: the place of departure and the place of arrival, followed by either the word Â‘roadÂ’ or the word Â‘ferryÂ’ indicating what kind of section it is. If the section is a road, its length (a positive integer) is given in km. For example: </p>
 
<blockquote><p>Dryna Solholmen road 32 </p></blockquote>
 
<p>Lines describing ferry sections have more information. Following the word Â“ferryÂ”, the duration of the ferry crossing, in minutes (a positive integer) is given. This is followed by the frequency f (f > 0) of the ferry, that is, the number of times the ferry departs in a single hour. The next f integers give the departure times of the ferry, in ascending order. For example: </p>
 
<blockquote><p>Manhiller Fodnes ferry 20 2 15 35 </p></blockquote>
 
<p>The ferry travels from Manhiller to Fodnes in 20 minutes, and it leaves twice an hour (on 0h15, 0h35, 1h15, 1h35,Â…). The beginning of the entire trip always starts at a full hour.

<p>The company Pacific Island Net (PIN) has identified several small island groups in the Pacific that do not have a fast internet connection. PIN plans to tap this potential market by offering internet service to the island inhabitants. Each groups of islands already has a deep-sea cable that connects the main island to the closest internet hub on the mainland (be it America, Australia or Asia). All that remains to be done is to connect the islands in a group to each other. You must write a program to help them determine a connection procedure.</p><p align=center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2478a.jpg><p>For each island, you are given the position of its router and the number of island inhabitants. In the figure, the dark dots are the routers and the numbers are the numbers of inhabitants. PIN will build connections between pairs of routers such that every router has a path to the main island. PIN has decided to build the network such that the total amount of cable used is minimal. Under this restriction, there may be several optimal networks. However, it does not matter to PIN which of the optimal networks is built.</p><p>PIN is interested in the average time required for new customers to access the internet, based on the assumption that construction on all cable links in the network begins at the same time. Cable links can be constructed at a rate of one kilometer of cable per day. As a result, shorter cable links are completed before the longer links. An island will have internet access as soon as there is a path from the island to the main island along completed cable links. If mi is the number of inhabitants of the ith island and ti is the time when the island is connected to the internet, then the average connection time is:</p><p align=center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2478a.jpg><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>The input consists of several descriptions of groups of islands.

<p>Prospecting for new sources of oil has become a high-technology industry. With improved drilling technology it has become economically viable to seek out ever smaller and harder to reach deposits of oil. However, using exploratory drilling to locate these deposits is not cost-efficient, so researchers have developed methods to detect oil indirectly.</p><p>One such method to detect oil is sonar, which uses reflected sound waves to locate caves in underground rock formations. Determining how much oil can be contained in such a cave is a difficult problem.</p><p align=center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2479.jpg></p><p>In this problem, you will be given some cross-sections of underground caves, represented by polygons such as the ones shown in the figure. Some of the points bounding the polygon may be holes through which oil can seep out into the surrounding rock (represented by black circles in the figure). Given the polygonal shape of the cave and the positions of the holes, you must compute the maximum amount of oil that could be in the cave (shown as gray shaded areas in the figure). This amount is limited by the fact that, in any connected body of oil, the oil level can never be above a hole, since it would drain into the surrounding rock instead.</p><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>The input contains several cave descriptions, each in the form of a polygon that specifies a cross-section of a cave. The first line of each description contains a single integer n, representing the number of points on the polygon (3 <=  n <= 100). </p>

<p>Each of the following n lines contains three integers x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, h<sub>i</sub>. The values (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) give
 the positions of the points on the boundary of the polygon in counterclockwise order. The 
polygon is simple-that is, it does not cross or touch itself. The value of h<sub>i</sub> is equal to 
1 if the point is a hole through which oil can seep out, and 0 otherwise. The "upward"
 direction in each case is the positive y-axis. </p>

<p>A partition of a rectangle is a subdivision of the rectangle into a set of smaller, non-overlapping 
sub-rectangles. Figure 1 shows several examples of partitions. </p>

<p align=center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2480a.jpg></p>

<p>Figure 2 shows three equal sized rectangles, partitioned into sub-rectangles. Partition B is
 obtained from partition A by partitioning two of the sub-rectangles of A. Generally, if a partition
 B is obtained from A by partitioning one or more of its sub-rectangles, we say that B is finer than
 A, or that A is coarser than B. This relation is partial: partition C is neither coarser nor finer
 than A or B. </p>

<p align=center><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2480a.jpg></p>

<p>Given two partitions D and E of the same rectangle, infinitely many partitions exist that are finer 
than both D and E. In Figure 3 both F and G are finer than D and E. Among the partitions that are finer

<P>One method used to measure the length of a path is to roll a wheel (similar to a bicycle wheel) along the
 path. If we know the radius of the wheel and the number of revolutions it makes as it travels along the path,
 the length of the path can be computed. 

<p>This method works well if the path is smooth. But when there are curbs or other abrupt elevation changes
 in the path, the path distance may not be accurately determined, because the wheel may rotate around a point
 (like the edge of a curb), or the wheel may roll along a vertical surface. In this problem you are to 
determine the distance moved by the center of such a wheel as it travels along a path that includes only 
horizontal and vertical surfaces. 

<p>To measure a path, the wheel is placed with its center directly above the origin of the path. The wheel
 is then moved forward over the path as far as possible, always remaining in contact with the surface,
 ending with its center directly above the end of the path. 

<p>Consider the path shown in the illustration on the left below, and assume the wheel has a radius of 2. 
The path begins and ends with horizontal segments of length 2 at the same elevation. Between these there
 is a horizontal segment of length 2.828427 at 2 units below the elevation of the other two horizontal
 segments. To measure this path, the wheel is placed at position 1. It then moves horizontally to position
 2, rotates 45 degrees to position 3, rotates another 45 degrees to position 4, and finally rolls
 horizontally to position 5. The center of the wheel moved a distance of 7.1416, not 6.8284. 

<p>In the illustration on the right below, the path begins and ends with horizontal segments of length 3,
 separated by a 7-unit wide region placed 7 units below the surface. If the wheel has a radius of 1, then
 it will move 26.142 units before reaching the end of the path.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<p>For this problem there are multiple input cases. Each case begins with a positive real number
 specifying the radius of the wheel and an integer n, which is at least 1 but not greater than 50.
 There then follow n pairs of real numbers. The first number in each pair gives the horizontal
 distance along the path to the next vertical surface. The second number in each pair gives the
 signed change in the elevation of the path at the vertical surface, with positive numbers representing
 an increase in elevation. The vertical surfaces are always perpendicular to the horizontal surfaces. 
The elevation change in the nth pair will always be 0. 


<p>The input is terminated by a pair of zeroes.

<P>Consider a set of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> clocks. Each clock has a single hour hand that can only point to one of the following hours: 3, 6, 9 or 12.

You have obtained a set of pentagonal titanium plates, formerly used in the heat-exchanger of 
a nuclear power station. From this you want to construct cubic boxes (small safes?), for which 
you will need square plates. The problem is that you don't have the equipment to forge the 
pentagonal plates into neat squares. The best you can do is to try and cut the largest possible 
square from each of the pentagonal plates.

<P>Our intrepid adventurer, Miss Croft, has stumbled across a difficult puzzle while exploring an ancient Mayan temple. The puzzle comprises a grid of trampolines contained in a rectangular room. Each trampoline can be represented by a square on a grid, as shown below. The difficulty in crossing the room lies in the fact that each trampoline has a different degree of elasticity, so that some trampolines will propel you only one square, while others may propel you several squares.<P><P><BR>To safely reach the exit, Lara has to jump on the trampolines in the correct sequence in order to reach the `end' square. To simplify matters, the `Begin' square will always be at position (0,0) on the grid, while the `End' square will be at the diagonally opposite corner of the grid, e.g. at (2,2) in the diagram below. The coordinates are listed in pairs of the form (horizontal, vertical).<P>Several rules apply:<P><OL><LI>You may only jump along the major axes of the grid, i.e. in the diagram you may only jump horizontally or vertically, not diagonally. </LI><LI>You must jump the exact number of squares indicated by the trampoline's strength. Using the grid shown below, you can (for example) jump from (1,0) to (1,2). </LI><LI>You shouldn't jump into the walls at the edge of the grid. For example, you cannot try to jump from (1,0) in the direction of (2,0), since you would hit the wall. The (1,0) square forces you to jump a distance of 2 squares, the wall is only one square away in that direction. </LI><LI>You may visit each square once at most. </LI></OL><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="415" HEIGHT="444" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2494.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p2494.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>Your task is to list the shortest possible route from the starting trampoline (square) to the end trampoline (square).

You have been asked to design a security system for protecting the crown jewels. After careful 
consideration (and watching numerous Remington Steele episodes), you have decided to set 
up a laser tripwire alarm system. The system works by bouncing a laser beam off mirror strips 
fitted to the walls of the room.  Since the beam will follow a fixed path through the room, you 
can place a single sensor at the end of the laser's path. If anyone breaks the beam at any 
point along the path that the laser follows, the light will not reach the sensor, setting off the 
alarm. The diagram below illustrates a how a beam originating at P0 is reflected off the walls, 
eventually reaching the point P3 (this is a top-down view of the room).

<P>
Your task is to calculate the path that the beam will take through the room so that you know 
where you have to place the sensor. Your input will be the geometry of the room, and the 
origin of the laser beam. Note that the problem domain is restricted to two dimensions.  

<P>
The laser beam is reflected in a direction so that the angle of reflection (with respect to the 
wall) is equal to the angle of incidence. You don't have to worry about hitting corners; test 
cases will never have beams hitting the corner exactly.

<P>The Enthusiasts of Reptiles and Alligators United (ERAU) is a fun-loving group that wants to use special ``club-names" for its members. Instead of relying on things like physical features for these names (which might be insulting to someone who earned a club name like ``Stinky"), they've decided to use a permutation of the person's real name as the club name. To create a club name, they will first reverse the order of all of the vowels in the person's name and then reverse the order of the consonants in the name. For example, for the name WALDO, the vowels are A and O. Reversing their order gives WOLDA. The consonants W, L, and D are then reversed, giving the club name of DOLWA.<P>ERAU has asked for your help creating club names. They consider the letters A, E, I, O, and U to be the only vowels.

<P>The head of the Expanded River Access Unit (ERAU) in Florida has initiated a state bridge- building program on the Stinky-Muddy river to make the river navigable by barges. Over the years, each town on the river built its own bridge system in an impromptu manner as needed. Since the river is wide with many islands, some of the towns have rather complex sets of bridges. Before constructing new, barge-friendly bridges at each town, all the old bridges must be dismantled. You are to write a program to determine the minimum cost for transporting the bridge removal equipment.<P>In each town, the dismantling equipment is dropped off at some location (locations will be denoted by upper-case letters, A-Z) and each bridge is dismantled as the equipment moves across it. Finally, the equipment is picked up.<P>Moving equipment from location to location using existing bridges is free but destroys the bridge used. If the equipment is dropped off and picked up at the same location, the pick-up cost is $10,000, otherwise it is $15,000. If the equipment gets stranded before it has removed all the bridges, it must be airlifted to a new location. The cost of each airlift operation is $25,000.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="537" HEIGHT="511" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/24/p2499.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p2499.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>In the example above, the minimum transportation cost would be $40,000. One of the ways this can be accomplished by dropping off the equipment at C; removing in order the bridges from C to D, D to C, C to A, A to B, and B to D; airlifting the equipment to F; removing the bridge from F to E; and picking the equipment up at E. The airlift from D to F, incurs a charge of $25,000, and, since the drop-off and pick-up locations (C and F respectively) are different, a $15,000 pick-up charge is added.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>For each town in the data set, the first line of input will be the name of the town (consisting of one or more characters with no spaces), followed by the number of bridges, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> <!-- MATH

Every 4 years, FIFA organizes the World Cup Tournament to determine the Soccer (Football)
Champion of the World. The tournament is divided into multiple phases.  First, the teams have to
participate in a round of matches against the other nations in their geographical region. Each
regional tournament produces a number of qualified teams. In the ``first round of the final phase,"
the qualified teams are divided into groups of four, and they play a round-robin tournament
against the other teams in the same group. The two teams out of each group with the highest
relative ranking qualify for the next phase of the tournament. You must write a program that,
given the teams in each group, and the results of the round-robin matches, will determine which
two teams will move on to the next phase.

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<B>Rules:</B>

<P>
The relative ranking of any pair of teams within the group is determined by the sequential
application of the following rules.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Total points: each team is assigned 3 points for each match it won, 1 point for each match it
     drew, and 0 points for each match it lost. The team with the higher total points has the higher
     ranking.
</LI>
<LI>Goal Differential: the sum of goals scored by the team, minus the sum of goals scored against
     the team, in all of the matches it played during the round. If the two teams have the same
     total points, the team with the higher goal differential has the higher ranking.
</LI>
<LI>Goals scored: the number of goals scored by the team in all the matches played during this
     round of the tournament. If the two teams have the same total points, and goal differential,
     the team with the higher number of goals has the higher ranking.
</LI>
<LI>Seed: a number reflecting the official FIFA placement of the team before the current phase of
     the tournament. The teams are listed in the input data set in order of their placement within
     each group, from first to last seed. When two teams have the same total points, goal
     differential, and number of goals scored, a team with lower seed has the higher ranking than
     a team with a higher seed.
</LI>

The squares of the board can be uniquely identified by labeling the rows 1 through 8, and the columns `a' through `h.'

<P>Modern buildings often have lights controlled by 3-way switches in more than one location. The light switches are collected into groups called <SPAN CLASS="textit">banks</SPAN> of switches at different places in the building. Light switches can be either 'up' or 'down' and lights can be either 'on' or 'off.' 3-way switches work by toggling the light status whenever they are changed between the up and down position, so if a switch controlling a light were up when the light were on, changing the switch to down would turn off the light.

so she wants to take advantage of symmetries in the designs and not cut a whole pattern if
she doesn't have to.  Consider the design:

Polly receives her designs from her customers as a rectangular bi-level raster (pixels are
either black or white). The set of all <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">black</SPAN> pixels defines a pattern. There may be any number
of white extra rows and columns around the pattern that should not be considered as part of
the pattern (since her customers work on different sized grids and may want a pattern smaller
than the grid they have).  You are to determine whether the pattern is symmetrical
horizontally, or vertically, or both.

<P><SPAN CLASS="textit">This problem is dedicated to National Squirrel Awareness Week, October 7 to 13, 2002.</SPAN><P>You may think that squirrels running around are just running at random, but in fact, they're involved in a very detailed version of hide and seek. One squirrel searches for the nut that the others have hidden as the others give the seeker hints about where the nut is. Rocky is smarter than the average squirrel, so has decided to write a program to play this game. He's asked for your help.<P><P><BR>Write a program to simulate a treasure hunt game. Rocky decides to simplify the problem so it takes place in a long narrow stretch of the forest. At the beginning of each game, a nut is placed in the corridor and Rocky starts from the end of the corridor. Rocky attempts to find the nut. He does this by moving to another point in the corridor, whereupon the computer tells him whether he is ``warmer" (he has moved closer to the nut than his last position), ``colder" (he has moved farther away from the nut than his last position), ``same" (he has not moved closer or farther away from the nut) or he has reached the nut. Rocky continues until he exactly reaches the location of the nut, which always happens within 20 moves.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Each input line represents a new game. Each input line contains at least two and at most 21 integers separated by whitespace. The integers represent locations along the corridor, expressed in units of feet. Rocky begins each game at location 0 feet. The first integer on an input line is the location of the nut. This integer is guaranteed to be different from 0. The remaining integers represent locations Rocky moves to, in order. Rocky will never move more than 5280 feet away from his original location. Rocky will always reach the nut in each game, and this will be the last move on the input line. Your program should stop processing input lines when the nut is located at 5280 feet (a mile is way too far for Rocky to go for only one nut).<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>For each location that Rocky moves to, determine whether he is warmer, colder, the same, or has reached the nut.

<P>The Florida Expressways and Roadways Accounting Unit (ERAU) has learned just enough math to realize they can determine if some drivers have been speeding on their roads and have decided to add speeding fines onto the tolls if the speeding is excessive. They've decided the speeding is excessive if the average speed is more than 1.00 MPH above the speed limit of the road. For example, if a driver gets on the highway at MM (Mile Marker) 190 at 2:10 PM and off at MM 230 at 2:40 PM, the driver covered 40 miles in 30 minutes, and had an average speed of 80 MPH. If the speed limit on the road was 75 MPH, this driver would have the fine added onto the toll. If another driver got on the road at MM 300 at 11:05 PM and got off at MM 149 at 1:05 AM, that driver would have an average speed of 75.5 MPH and would not be penalized if the speed limit were 75 MPH.<P><P><BR>They've asked you to come up with a program to compute the tolls for their roads, including the fine. To simplify the problem, you should assume all exits and entrances are positioned exactly at the mile markers (so no vehicle will enter at MM 190.4).<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of one or more test cases.

<P>
The Every Recording Authentication Union has contracted you to write a program to detect if
copyrighted music files are being distributed on the Internet. Checking the names of the songs
does not work, since it is too easily defeated by using minor spelling variations. Instead, they
want to be able to see if the sound-waves of a suspect music sample approximately matches one
or more predetermined copyrighted works.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The music samples you are to check all encode music as a sequence of sound-wave amplitudes
sampled at 44.1 kHz (i.e., 44,100 times per second.)  The amplitudes (sample points) are
measured in units of micro-decibels (1,000,000 micro-decibels equals 1 decibel.)

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Checking music for exact matching amplitudes will detect only exact copies, and will leave
similar recordings of the same music undetected.  In order to match music more intelligently, a
sound-wave is converted to a rough indication of its shape. To do this, the change in amplitude is
computed between every two consecutive sample points, and the change is placed into one of six
discrete categories labeled `A' through `F'.  The categories are defined based on the rate of
change measured in decibels per second, and is converted to an "angle".  Each character
represents a range of angles as follows:

Since understatement is commonplace in this village, this ``fact" actually means that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is older than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> by at least <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> years <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>A</I> - <I>B</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/25/2507img1.png ALT="$ \ge$"><I>n</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.<P>We are told that folks over the age of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> leave the village to find their fortunes elsewhere (i.e., the oldest inhabitant has an age <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/25/2507img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>).

Pat and Chris have invented a new game based on the Prisoner's Dilemma.  Each of them
gets to select a horizontally aligned rectangle on a grid by specifying two corners, diagonally
opposite from each other.  (Horizontally aligned means the sides are parallel to the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>- and
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-axes.) If the rectangles have a no area in their intersection, Pat and Chris each get to add the
area of their rectangle to their scores, but if the rectangles have an intersection of more than
zero area, they have to subtract the area of their rectangle from their score.  Suppose Pat
selected the corners (0, 1) and (3, 3) and Chris selected (6, 2) and (3, 6), defining the
rectangles:

 ALT="\epsfbox{p2508a.eps}">
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>
</DIV>

<P>
Since the intersection between the two rectangles has zero area, Pat would add 6 to her score
and Chris would add 12 to his score.  If Pat had selected the rectangle with corners (0, 3) and
(3, 1) and Chris had selected (5, 2) and (0, 0), there is a non-zero overlap, so Pat would lose
6 points and Chris would lose 10 points.

 the towns such that one could travel from any town to any other town <B>even
 if one road was closed under repair</B>.  Carefully, all such roads must be
 constructed as geometrically straight lines.  Further, the condition that
 a traveller be able to get from one town to another (even with one road closed)
 needs to be satisfied by traversing the roads as straight lines in their
 entirety -- not stopping partway along one road to switch to another.

 Because of rich soil in those lands, the future inhabitants of the place
 have decided to produce beer. On the crossroads (a crossroad is merey the
 intersection of two or more roads) the king plans to build beer stands
 (one stand per a crossroad). So, if three or four (or twenty) roads intersect
 in a single point, theres still only one appropriate place for a beer stand.
 The King must choose locations for the towns and the roads. You need to advise
 him so that he builds as many beer stands as possible.

You are the owner of a very nice boat. You have many requests to rent your
beautiful boat during the summer time and you decided to maximize your profit.
For each client you know the number of days he wants to rent the boat and a
list of choices, where a choice means an amount of money and a deadline.
The deadline is the number of days counted from a time origin. You get the
money for a given deadline (when the holiday must end) only if you are able
to rent the boat before that deadline.

For example your friend Jack wants to travel on the Mediterranean Sea for 20
days and has the following choices:

<UL>
<LI>if the holiday deadline is 60 days you can get 1000 EUR provided
the boat is rented in between 0 and 41 (60days-20days+1) for 20
days;
</LI>
<LI>if the holiday deadline is 70 days you can get 800 EUR.
</LI>
</UL>

If a client does not contribute to the maximization of your profit you can drop
that client. You know all the clients and their choices and you must rent the
boat according to the order in which the clients submit their requests.

Write a program that, given the clients, computes the largest profit you can get.

The art galleries of the new and very futuristic building of the
Center for Balkan Cooperation have the form of polygons (not
necessarily convex). When a big exhibition is organized, watching
over all of the pictures is a big security concern. Your task is
that for a given gallery to write a program which finds the
surface of the area of the floor, from which each point on the
walls of the gallery is visible. On the first figure a map of a
gallery is given in some co-ordinate system. The area wanted is

Recently, there was an international volleyball championship. Speaking of
volleyball, we are interested in the probability of winning of one or another
team, if we know some information about the teams. Here are the rules of the
game and the necessary information:

<UL>
<LI>the match is played by two teams: A and B;
</LI>
<LI>the first team to win <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> games in a match, wins the match;
</LI>
<LI>each game consists of rounds; each round is won by one of the teams, and the
team adds one point to its score for the current game;
</LI>
<LI>the first team to win <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> points in a game, wins the game;
</LI>
<LI>if team A serves the ball in a round, it has <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Pa</I>%</SPAN> chance to win the round
(and <!-- MATH
 $(100-Pa)\%$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(100 - <I>Pa</I>)%</SPAN> to loose it);
</LI>
<LI>if team B serves the ball in a round, it has <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Pb</I>%</SPAN> chance to win the round
(and <!-- MATH
 $(100-Pb)\%$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(100 - <I>Pb</I>)%</SPAN> to loose it);
</LI>
<LI>if a round is not the first in a game, the ball in the round is served by
the team that won the last round;
</LI>
<LI>if a game is not the first in a match, the ball in the first round of the
game is served by the team that did not served the ball in the first round
of the previous game;
</LI>
<LI>both teams have an equal chance to serve the ball in the first round of the
very first game of a match.
</LI>
</UL>

So, for given values of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Pa</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Pb</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN>, you have to compute the probability,

One of the programming paradigm in parallel processing is the
producer/consumer
paradigm that can be implemented using a system with a ``manager" process and
several ``client" processes. The clients can be producers, consumers, etc.
The manager keeps a trace of client processes. Each process is identified
by its cost that is a strictly positive integer in the range <!-- MATH
 $1 \dots 10000$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1...10000</SPAN>.
The number of processes with the same cost cannot exceed 10000. The queue
is managed according to three types of requests, as follows:

<UL>
<LI><TT>a</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> - add to the queue the process with the cost <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>;
</LI>
<LI><TT>r</TT> - remove a process, if possible, from the queue according to the current
manager policy;
</LI>
<LI><TT>p</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> - enforce the policy <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> of the manager, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> is 1 or 2. <B>The default
manager policy is 1</B>
</LI>
<LI><TT>e</TT> - ends the list of requests.
</LI>
</UL>

There are two manager policies:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1</DT>
<DD>- remove the minimum cost process
</DD>
<DT>2</DT>
<DD>- remove the maximum cost process
</DD>
</DL>

The manager will print the cost of a removed process only if the
ordinal number of the removed process is in the <B>removal list</B>.

Your job is to write a program that simulates the manager process.

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input is from a text file. Each data set in the input has the
following format:

<UL>
<LI>the maximum cost of the processes
</LI>
<LI>the length of the removal list
</LI>
<LI>the removal list - the list of ordinal numbers of the removed processes that
will be displayed; for example 1 4 means that the cost of the first and fourth
removed processes will be displayed
</LI>
<LI>the list of requests each on a separate line.
</LI>
</UL>

Each data set ends with an e request. The data sets are separated
by empty lines.

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The program prints on standard output the cost of each process
that is removed, provided that the ordinal number of the remove
request is in the list and the queue is not empty at that moment.
If the queue is empty the program prints <TT>-1</TT>. The results are
printed on separate lines. An empty line separates the results of
different data sets.

You are assigned to design network connections between certain
points in a wide area. You are given a set of points in the area,
and a set of possible routes for the cables that may connect pairs
of points. For each possible route between two points, you are
given the length of the cable that is needed to connect the points
over that route. Note that there may exist many possible routes
between two given points. It is assumed that the given possible
routes connect (directly or indirectly) each two points in the
area.

Your task is to design the network for the area, so that
there is a connection (direct or indirect) between every two
points (i.e., all the points are interconnected, but not
necessarily by a direct cable), and that the total length of the
used cable is minimal.

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input file consists of a number
of data sets. Each data set defines one required network. The
first line of the set contains two integers: the first defines the
number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> of the given points, and the second the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN> of given
routes between the points. The following <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN> lines define the given
routes between the points, each giving three integer numbers: the
first two numbers identify the points, and the third gives the
length of the route. The numbers are separated with white spaces.
A data set giving only one number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I> = 0</SPAN> denotes the end of the
input. The data sets are separated with an empty line.

The maximal
number of points is 50. The maximal length of a given route is
100. The number of possible routes is unlimited. The nodes are
identified with integers between 1 and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> (inclusive). The routes
between two points <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN> may be given as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I>&nbsp;<I>j</I></SPAN> or as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I>&nbsp;<I>i</I></SPAN>.

<P>There are many scenarios in which we need to know how fast an object is moving. For example, the air-traffic controller in an airport would like to know the speed of a descending plane and give warning if it's too fast or too slow. The speed detection cameras have helped the police to catch the speeding drivers, and so on.<P>In this problem, you are supposed to write a program to recognize the speed of a moving object.<P>Assume that an object is moving on a two dimensional plane, with a constant speed and direction. A camera is taking a shot every second. Assume the camera can record the real situation of the plain - you don't need to worry about the view-angle.<P>The background is black and the only object is white, except some noise introduced by the camera. Anyway, you can assume that the largest continuous white area is always the object. There is always only one largest continuous white area in this problem.<P>Given several pictures taken by the camera, calculate the speed of the object. Output the speed of the object.<P>A picture is represented by a matrix which contains `<TT>.</TT>' or `<TT>x</TT>' only, where `<TT>.</TT>' in the matrix means a black block and `<TT>x</TT>' means a white block. There are at least two pictures.<P>Here are some detailed definitions:<P><UL><LI>The edge of each block is 1 mm (That is, each `<TT>.</TT>' or `<TT>x</TT>' in the matrix represents one 1mm <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>x</TT></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> 1mm block.) </LI><LI>``The speed of the object" is defined by the moving speed of the center of the object as geometric center :<P></P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay"><IMG WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="100" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/25/2517img1.png ALT="$\displaystyle \left(\vphantom{\frac{\displaystyle \int_{(x,y)\in Object}xdxdy}{...

<P>Random Algorithms are very popular now.

<P>
A pleasant headache that parents have every year is preparing Christmas gifts for their children. Because each child 
envies each other having seen what others received, the parents have to prepare gifts so that no child should envy 
any other child. 

<P>
Before a husband and wife go for Christmas shopping, they announce to their children a fixed set of gift candidates 
and declare that each child will receive a subset of the candidates. The children then respond to the parents with 
conditions  for  them  to  be  happy.  Each  child's  condition  is  relatively  defined  in  terms  of  the  gifts  that  other siblings would have. The goal of the parents is to satisfy all their children's conditions with the smallest such gift set for each child. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Each child's condition is always expressed as a conjunction:

Two mountain climbers are located at opposite ends of a mountain range, at the same elevation. The two 
climbers want to walk along the mountain range and reach each other's starting place, while always staying at 
the same elevation. The climbers may move forward or backward to assure that they stay at the same elevation. 
It is well known that it is always possible for the two climbers to reach each other's starting place if the mountain range never drops below the starting elevation. Given a mountain range, compute the minimum sum 
of the two walk lengths of the two climbers to reach each other's starting place from their own starting place.

<P>
There is a worker who may lack the motivation to perform at his peak level of efficiency because he is lazy.
He wants to minimize the amount of work he does (he is ``lazy"), but he is subject to a constraint that he must 
be busy when there is work that he can do.

<P>

<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1, 2,..., <I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> having processing times <!-- MATH

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>I</I><SUB>i</SUB> = [<I>a</I><SUB>i</SUB>, <I>d</I><SUB>i</SUB>]</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The jobs are executed by the worker, and the worker executes only one job at a time. Once a job is begun, it must be completed without interruptions. When a job is completed, another job must begin immediately, if one exists to be executed. Otherwise, the worker is idle and begins executing a job as soon as one arrives. You should note that for each job <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the length of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>I</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>

<p>Implement a ranking program similar to the one used for this programming contest.<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>The input file contains one or more contests followed by a line containing only zero that signals the end of the file. Each contest begins with a line containing a positive integer <i>c</i> no greater than 20 indicating the number of teams in the contest, and is followed by <i>c</i> lines that contain a team name and the solution times for seven problems, separated by spaces. Team names consist of between one and ten letters. All team names within a contest are unique. Times are nonnegative integers no greater than 500.<p>As described in the "Notes to Teams", teams are ranked first by greatest number of problems solved, then by least total time, then by least geometric mean of all nonzero times. Teams that are still tied are given the same numeric ranking and are listed in alphabetical order, using case-sensitive string comparison. The numeric ranking for a team is always one more than the number of teams ranked ahead of (not tied with) that team. For this problem all geometric means will be rounded to an integer as described below, and only the rounded value will be used when computing rankings and displaying results.<p>If all times are zero, then the geometric mean is also zero. Otherwise, if there are <i>n</i> nonzero times <i>t</i><sub><small>1</small></sub>, ..., <i>t</i><sub><small><i>n</i></small></sub>, then the geometric mean is defined to be<p align=center>exp ((ln <i>t</i><sub><small>1</small></sub> + ln <i>t</i><sub><small>2</small></sub> + ... + ln <i>t</i><sub><small><i>n</i></small></sub>) / <i>n</i>)</p><p>where exp <i>x</i> means <i>e</i><sup><small><i>x</i></small></sup> and ln <i>x</i> means the natural logarithm of <i>x</i>. (There are other mathematically equivalent definitions of the geometric mean, but they may produce slightly different answers due to roundoff and/or overflow problems. Use this definition to get the same answers as the judges.) After computing the geometric mean, round it to an integer by adding 0.5 and truncating any fractional digits. (C/C++ and Java automatically truncate fractions when casting a floating-point type to an integral type. In Pascal use the <tt>trunc</tt> function.)<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>For each contest you must output the rankings in a table. All tables will have the same width, with the length equal to the number of teams entered in the contest. Use the <i>exact</i> format shown in the examples. Each contest has a numbered header followed by a table with one team entry per line. Each entry contains the ranking, team name, problems solved, total time, geometric mean, and then the individual solution times in the same order they appeared in the input. In the first example all values completely fill their fields. In general you may need to pad values with spaces (never tabs) so that they have the correct field width. The team name is left-justified, and all other fields are right-justified. The ranking always has two digits, including a leading zero if necessary. Spaces will never appear at the beginning or end of lines.<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001003000000000000000">Sample Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><pre>1

<P>Sam and Ella run a catering service. They like to put on a show when serving meatballs to guests seated at round tables. They march out of the kitchen with pots of meatballs and start serving adjacent guests. Ella goes counterclockwise and Sam goes clockwise, until they both plop down their last meatball, at the same time, again at adjacent guests. This impressive routine can only be accomplished if they can divide the table into two sections, each having the same number of meatballs. You are to write a program to assist them.</P><P>At these catering events, each table seats 2 &lt;= <I>N</I> &lt;= 30 guests. Each guest orders at least one and at most nine meatballs.

<p><tt>=== Op tech briefing, 2002/11/02 06:42 CST ===</tt><p>"The item is locked in a Klein safe behind a painting in the second-floor library. Klein safes are extremely rare; most of them, along with Klein and his factory, were destroyed in World War II. Fortunately old Brumbaugh from research knew Klein's secrets and wrote them down before he died. A Klein safe has two distinguishing features: a combination lock that uses letters instead of numbers, and an engraved quotation on the door. A Klein quotation always contains between five and twelve distinct uppercase letters, usually at the beginning of sentences, and mentions one or more numbers. Five of the uppercase letters form the combination that opens the safe. By combining the digits from all the numbers in the appropriate way you get a numeric <i>target</i>. (The details of constructing the target number are classified.) To find the combination you must select five letters <i>v</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> that satisfy the following equation, where each letter is replaced by its ordinal position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26). The combination is then <i>vwxyz</i>. If there is more than one solution then the combination is the one that is lexicographically greatest, <i>i.e.</i>, the one that would appear last in a dictionary."<p align=center><i>v</i> - <i>w</i><sup><small>2</small></sup> + <i>x</i><sup><small>3</small></sup> - <i>y</i><sup><small>4</small></sup> + <i>z</i><sup><small>5</small></sup> = <i>target</i></p><p>"For example, given target 1 and letter set ABCDEFGHIJKL, one possible solution is FIECB, since 6 - 9<sup><small>2</small></sup> + 5<sup><small>3</small></sup> - 3<sup><small>4</small></sup> + 2<sup><small>5</small></sup> = 1. There are actually several solutions in this case, and the combination turns out to be LKEBA. Klein thought it was safe to encode the combination within the engraving, because it could take months of effort to try all the possibilities even if you knew the secret. But of course computers didn't exist then."<p><tt>=== Op tech directive, computer division, 2002/11/02 12:30 CST ===</tt><p>"Develop a program to find Klein combinations in preparation for field deployment.

<p>Rocky Oil owns several rectangular oil fields in which it is drilling new wells. It wants to connect all wells in a field to a single East-West pipeline using straight North-South pipes. Your task is to write a program that first finds the location of the E-W pipeline such that the total length of the N-S pipes in the field is minimal; then it must draw a map of the oil field, if possible.</p><p>Each rectangular oil field is a grid 94 units long in the E-W direction and 73 units long in the N-S direction. The grid uses integer coordinates, with the SW corner at (1,1) and the NE corner at (94,73). Oil wells may be at any integer coordinates within the grid, and all wells will appear at different positions. The E-W pipeline will stretch across the entire field at an integer N-S coordinate. Wells with the same E-W coordinate share the same pipe. In case there are multiple positions for the E-W pipeline giving the same minimal length, always choose the one furthest south (i.e., with the lowest N-S coordinate).</p><p>Consider the first input example below. With the E-W pipeline at 11, the well at E-W position 1 is on the pipeline and has length zero. The two wells at E-W position 69 can share a single pipe of length 18. The total length for all three wells is 18. If the E-W pipeline were at 20 there would be two N-S pipes, one of length 9 at position 1 and another of length 9 at position 69, again with a total length of 18. In fact, any E-W pipeline located from 11 to 20 results in a total length of 18, which is minimal. Since there is more than one position for the pipeline that minimizes the length, choose the southernmost position, which is 11.</p><p>Any map drawn must occupy at most 69 columns and 19 rows (not counting borders and labels) so it fits on a standard-sized display. The map must include the E-W pipeline, all wells, and all N-S pipes. Only that portion of the field actually containing wells should be drawn, using the smallest bounding rectangle whose edges are multiples of 5. The E-W pipeline will always stretch across the entire map, regardless of its width. Wells must be inside the bounding rectangle, not on any of its edges. These constraints may make it impossible to draw some oil fields. The first input example shows the largest map possible.</p><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>The input consists of data for one or more oil fields, followed by a line containing 0 0 which signals the end of the input. Data for each oil field consists of one or more pairs of positive integers, one pair per line, representing the positions of oil wells in the field. The pair -1 -1 indicates the end of the data for a field.</p><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>For each oil field, output a line with a numbered header. Then output the map of the oil field, if possible. Otherwise, output a sentence with the location of the pipeline. Use the exact format shown below.</p><p>Use '<tt>@</tt>' to represent an oil well, '<tt>*</tt>' to represent a pipe, and '<tt>.</tt>' (a period) to represent an empty grid location. Wells take precedence over pipes, so if a well and a pipe occupy the same location, use '<tt>@</tt>'. Draw a border around the mapped oil field, using '<tt>|</tt>' (a vertical bar) for N-S edges and '<tt>-</tt>' (a dash) for E-W edges, but mark every 5th grid position with '<tt>+</tt>', as shown in the examples. Label each '<tt>+</tt>' with its position in the oil field. The label for each N-S '<tt>+</tt>' comes immediately before the '<tt>+</tt>' sign. The label for the northernmost '<tt>+</tt>' must start at the beginning of the first line of output. Labels for an E-W '<tt>+</tt>' must always have the most significant digit immediately below the '<tt>+</tt>'. Contrary to the usual output conventions, some of the lines in the map <I>will</i> have leading blanks.</p><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001003000000000000000">Sample Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><pre>1 11

You are a butler in a large mansion.  This mansion has so many 
rooms that they are merely referred to by number (room <tt>0</tt>, 
<tt>1</tt>, <tt>2</tt>, <tt>3</tt>, etc...).  Your master is a 
particularly absent-minded lout and continually leaves doors 
open throughout a particular floor of the house.  Over the 
years, you have mastered the art of traveling in a single 
path through the sloppy rooms and closing the doors behind 
you.  Your biggest problem is determining whether it is 
possible to find a path through the sloppy rooms where you:
<p>
<ol>
	<li>Always shut open doors behind you immediately after passing through
	<li>Never open a closed door
	<li>End up in your chambers (room <tt>0</tt>) with all doors closed
</ol>
<p>
In this problem, you are given a list of rooms and open doors between 
them (along with a starting room).  It is not needed to determine a 
route, only if one is possible.

<p>
Input to this problem will consist of a (non-empty) series of up to 
<tt>100</tt> data sets.  Each data set will be formatted according
to the following description, and there will be no blank lines 
separating data sets.
<p>
<ol>A single data set has <tt>3</tt> components:
	<li><i>Start line</i> - A single line, "<tt>START M N</tt>", 
where M indicates the butlerÃ•s starting room, and N 
indicates the number of rooms in the house 
(<tt>1 &le; N &le; 20</tt>).
	<li><i>Room list</i> - A series of <tt>N</tt> lines.  Each line 
lists, for a single room, every open door that leads to 
a room of higher number.  For example, if room <tt>3</tt> had open 
doors to rooms <tt>1</tt>, <tt>5</tt>, and <tt>7</tt>, the line for room <tt>3</tt> would 
read "<tt>5 7</tt>".  The first line in the list represents room 
<tt>0</tt>. The second line represents room <tt>1</tt>, and so on until 
the last line, which represents room (<tt>N - 1</tt>).  It is 
possible for lines to be empty (in particular, the last 
line will always be empty since it is the highest 
numbered room).  On each line, the adjacent rooms 
are always listed in ascending order. It is possible 
for rooms to be connected by multiple doors!
	<li><i>End line</i> - A single line, "<tt>END</tt>"
</ol>
<p>
Following the final data set will be a single line, "<tt>ENDOFINPUT</tt>".
<p>
Note that there will be no more than <tt>100</tt> doors in any single data set.

is the number of doors he closed.  Otherwise, print "<tt>NO</tt>".

"Forget it," Garret complained, throwing down the controller to
his PlayStation VIII, "this level is impossible."  He had just
"died" for the 17th time on level 54 of the game "Lemmings 9:
Lost in Space".
<p>
"No it isn't," his brother Ferret replied, "and I can prove it."
Ferret pulled his PlaySkool PDA from the back pocket of his
Levi's Huggies.
<p>
"First, picture the level as a rectangular grid."  Ferret 
punched a few of the buttons on his PDA and a rectangle 
appeared as he described.  "Your character, a Lemming holding 
an umbrella, starts at the top of this rectangle.  His goal 
is to reach the bottom without dying."
<p>
"I know that, you weasel, but what about the laser guns?" Garret 
whined.
<p>
"The name is Ferret, and I was just getting to that.  If we 
represent the level as a rectangular grid, then the Lemming
can occupy one square and each laser gun can occupy a square.  
Remember the laser guns are cyclic: they all shoot up the first 
turn, right the second turn, down the third turn, left the 
fourth turn, and then repeat the sequence."
<p>
"But you're forgetting the pits of lava!" Garret exclaimed.
<p>
"You didn't let me finish.  Each pit of lava also occupies a 
square.  And each plot of grass, the Lemming's destination, 
can also occupy a square.  Then, it's just a matter of 
manipulating the Lemming and laser beams in a series of 
turns to determine if it is possible for the Lemming to 
reach the bottom without 'dying'."
<p>
"You think you're so smart, Ferret, let's see if you can 
explain that again in a clear, concise way."
<p>
"Certainly":
<p>
The level will consist of a grid of squares.  The way each 
laser beam and the Lemming moves can be described in "turns".  
To determine if the Lemming can reach the bottom of the level 
without dying, Ferret devised some rules:
<p>
<ol>
	<li>Each turn will consist of two steps:
	<ol>
		<li>First, the laser guns will "fire" and 
maintain until the end of the turn, a beam in a direction 
dependent on the number of the turn.  On the first turn, 
each laser gun will shoot up (all squares directly above a 
laser gun are "unsafe" and cannot be occupied by the Lemming); 
on the second turn, each laser gun will shoot right; on the 
third turn, each laser gun will shoot down; on the fourth turn, 
each laser gun will shoot left; on the fifth turn, the sequence 
will repeat.
<p>
<pre>
Example:
    Column
    01234
R 0|  L  |&lt;- The Lemming will always start in a column on row 0
o 1|     | In this example, on the first turn, the laser beam
w 2|   S | will occupy squares (3,0),(3,1); second turn, (4,2);
  3|     | third turn, (3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6); fourth turn, 
  4|     | (0,2),(1,2),(2,2); fifth turn (repeating), (3,0),(3,1), etc.  
  5|     | (squares are represented using (column,row) notation)
  6|GPPGG|&lt;- The pits of lava and grass squares will always be
             in the last row
</pre>
		<li>Second, the Lemming will always move one row 
down, but to any one of three columns: one column to the left, 
one column to the right, or remain in the same column.  In the 
above example, on the first turn the Lemming <tt>(L)</tt> could move to 
square <tt>(1,1)</tt>, <tt>(2,1)</tt>, or <tt>(3,1)</tt> (if he moved to <tt>(3,1)</tt>, though, 
he would die because of the laser beam).  However, on any turn 
the Lemming cannot move outside of the grid (i.e., he cannot 
move to column <tt>-1</tt>, or to a column number equal to the number 
of columns).
	</ol>
	<li>The level is considered "possible" if the Lemming 
can reach any "grass" square without dying after a series of 
turns.

	<li>The Lemming will die if at any point he occupies 
the same square as a laser gun, its beam, or a pit of lava.  
This includes:
	<ol>
	<li>The Lemming moving into a square a pit of lava occupies,	
	<li>The Lemming moving into a square a laser gun occupies,
	<li>The Lemming moving into a square a laser beam occupies 
(even if it is a grass square!),
	<li>A laser gun firing a beam into a square the Lemming occupies
	</ol>

<p>
<ol>

is the number of rows in the grid representing the level.

	<li>The next y lines will represent the rows of the level, 
starting with row <tt>0</tt> (the top).  Each line will consist of 
<tt>x</tt> letters.  The letters will represent components of the 
level as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>L - Lemming (there will only be one '<tt>L</tt>' per

</H2>
<p>
For each data set, there will be exactly one output set, and 
there will be no blank lines separating output sets.
<p>
A single output set consists of a single line of the viral code 
after it has stabilized (through mutating).
<p>
The viral code will mutate according to the following rules:
<p>
<ol>
	<li>Initially the first viral segment to mutate begins 
with the first alphanumeric character of the viral code and 
ends with the rightmost alphanumeric character of the code.
	<li>If the first alphanumeric character of a viral 
segment is a letter (<tt>A-Z</tt>), that alphanumeric character
is considered "<tt>unstable</tt>", and will mutate into <tt>n</tt>, 
where <tt>n</tt> is the number of mutations that occur to the viral 
segment immediately to the unstable alphanumeric character's right 
(see #5), unless <tt>n</tt> is greater than <tt>9</tt>, in which 
case the unstable alphanumeric character will mutate into 
<tt>n % 10</tt>.  Also, if there is no viral segment immediately 
to the right of the unstable alphanumeric character, the unstable 
alphanumeric character will mutate into <tt>0</tt>.
	<li>If the first alphanumeric character of a viral segment, 
<tt>n</tt>, is a positive number (<tt>1-9</tt>), that alphanumeric 
character is also considered "<tt>unstable</tt>", and will mutate 
into <tt>n-1</tt>.  It also causes the viral segment beginning with 
the alphanumeric character <tt>n</tt> alphanumeric characters to its 
right and ending with the rightmost alphanumeric character of the 
viral code to mutate.  If there is no alphanumeric character 
<tt>n</tt> alphanumeric characters to its right, then the viral 
segment immediately to its right (see #5), if one exists, will 
mutate.
	<li>If the first alphanumeric character of a viral 
segment is <tt>0</tt>, that alphanumeric character is 
considered "<tt>stable</tt>", and will not mutate (the 
alphanumeric character will remain a <tt>0</tt> and a 
mutation will not be considered to have occurred).
	<li>A viral segment immediately to the right of an
alphanumeric character begins with the alphanumeric character 
one position to its right and ending with the rightmost 
alphanumeric character of the viral code.
