You are given a car odometer which displays the miles
traveled as an integer. The odometer has a defect, however: it proceeds from
the digit 3 to the digit 5, always skipping over the digit 4. This defect shows
up in all positions (the one's, the ten's, the hundred's, etc.). For example, if
the odometer displays 15339 and the car travels one mile, odometer reading
changes to 15350 (instead of 15340).

<P>Bridge is a 4-player (two teams of two) card game with many complicated conventions that even experienced players have difficulty keeping track of. Fortunately, we are not interested in these conventions for this problem.

Notice that a 0-5 <TT>"</TT>split<TT>"</TT> can be realized in two ways--opponent 1 has no spade and opponent 2 has 5 spades, or vice versa.<P>Good bridge players know that the best line of play often depends on the distribution.

<P>Scientists and engineers have found a way for human to settle in a far-away planet. The new immigrants have started building small towns and communication links connecting nearby towns. In building the communication network, they first chose a town as a center. Then they connected each nearby town to the center by a communication link.<P>As more and more people migrate to the new planet, a number of such networks have been built. These networks need to be connected to make it possible for people in every town in the planet to communicate. They connected these networks by connecting the centers using a simple path.<P>The first group of immigrants are mostly scientists and engineers. They prefer numbering their towns rather than naming them. Consider <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> towns connected by a network with only one center. If we number the center 0 and the nearby towns by integers in <SPAN CLASS="MATH">{1, 2,..., <I>n</I> - 1}</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. There is an interesting property of this numbering method. Suppose that we label of each link by the absolute value of the difference of the numbers of the two towns it connects. All links will get a distinct label. Furthermore, the labels of the links are exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH">{1, 2,..., <I>n</I> - 1}</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Thus, links are numbered automatically. This is called perfect numbering of the towns.<P>The immigrants love the numbering metho d very much, and wants to know if the numbering can be extended to the networks with many centers. Therefore, you are invited to write a program to solve the problem.<P>Let us study more about perfect numbering of the towns. Assume that all towns are properly numbered. It is easy to see that if the numbers of any two towns connected to the same center are switched, then the new numbering is also perfect. Therefore, perfect numbering of the towns is not unique.<P>It is convenient to assign a name to each town. Assume that there are at most 26 centers, and they are labeled by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I>0, <I>b</I>0,..., <I>z</I>0</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The towns connected to center <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I>0</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> will be called <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I>1, <I>a</I>2,...</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the towns connected to center <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I>0</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> will be called <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I>1, <I>b</I>2,...</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and so on.<P>To make the problem simple, we want a perfect numbering such that the numbers assign to the towns connected to the same center are ordered by their names. For example, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ai</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>'s label will be smaller than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>aj</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>'s label whenever <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> &lt; <I>j</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

<P>The concept of domination in graph theory arises naturally from the facility lo cation problem in operations research. Consider a geographical area that is partitioned into regions. Facilities are going to be placed in some of the regions. The problem is to cho ose a minimum number of regions at which to place these service facilities, so that each region is served by a facility in it or at least one facility adjacent to it when there is no facility in this region. This lo cation problem can be mo deled by a graph problem to find a minimum-cardinality vertex subset of an input graph such that every vertex not in the subset is adjacent to at least one vertex in the subset. Depending on different requirements in various lo cation problems, domination has many variants. Here we consider one of the variants.<P>A <SPAN CLASS="textit">perfect dominating set</SPAN> of a graph <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I> = (<I>V</I>, <I>E</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is a subset <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I> <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/33/3346img1.png ALT="$ \subseteq$"> <I>V</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> such that every vertex <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I> - <I>D</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> (that is, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I> <IMG WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/33/3346img1.png ALT="$ \in$"> <I>V</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>v</I> <IMG WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/33/3346img1.png ALT="$ \not\in$"><I>D</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> ) is adjacent to exactly one vertex in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> . The <SPAN CLASS="textit">perfect domination problem</SPAN> is to find a <SPAN CLASS="textit">minimum-cardinality perfect dominating set</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, i.e., <SPAN CLASS="MATH">| <I>D</I>|</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is smallest among the cardinalities of all perfect dominating sets of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

<P>Captain Picard and the Enterprise crew is under a mission to study an interesting culture in a distant planet called Ba'ku.

There are populated villages, connected by trails. The trail system covers the entire continent and divides the continent into many forests. It is one of these forests that Picard and his crew will cho ose to build the station in. According to past experience and some correlation study, the level of exploration by the inhabitants is directly proportional to the collective population of the surrounding villages, and inversely proportional to the area of the forest.

<P>A magnetic disk is made up of the rotating disks, the heads to access disks, and an assembly arm that moves the heads into the specified cylinder.

<P>Sudoku is popular puzzle demanding logic and patience. The aim of the puzzle is to enter a numeral from 1 through 9 in each cell of a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">9 <TT>x</TT> 9</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> grid made up of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3 <TT>x</TT> 3</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> sub-grids, starting with various numerals given in some cells. Each row, column and sub-grid must contain only one instance of each numeral. See Figure 2 and Figure 3 for a sample puzzle and its solution.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="440" HEIGHT="370" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/33/p3351a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3351a.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 2: An example of a Sudoku puzzle</DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="441" HEIGHT="372" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/33/p3351a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3351b.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 3: A solution to the Sudoku puzzle</DIV><P>Some Sudoku puzzles may have <SPAN CLASS="textit">unique</SPAN> solution. Dr. Susie thinks it is a good tool to enhance children's patience. However, he wants to avoid difficult puzzles so that the children will be able to solve it in a reasonable amount of time. After some research, Dr. Susie noticed that the following two heuristics are easily understood by children:<P><DL COMPACT><DT>1.</DT><DD>Each numeral can appear in any row, column, and sub-grid only once. Therefore, if the union of the numeral appeared in the same row, column and sub-grid of some free cell contains 8 numerals, and leaves only one available numeral to be filled into that cell, then it should be filled with that numeral. For example, in Figure 4, the cell marked <TT>x</TT> can only be filled with 2 since all the other 8 numerals have appeared in the row, column and sub-grid of it.</DD><DT>2.</DT><DD>Each sub-grid has to contain all the numerals. Therefore, if a numeral has not appeared in some sub-grid, say numeral 1, if there is only one free cell which can be filled by 1, due to the fact that all the other free cells in that sub-grid have 1 in the same row or column, then fill that cell with numeral 1. For example, in Figure 5 only the cell marked <TT>x</TT> can be filled with 1, all the other free cells are ruled out for the possibility due to 1s appeared in other sub-grid.</DD></DL><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="396" HEIGHT="371" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/33/p3351a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3351c.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 4: Heuristic Rule 1</DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="380" HEIGHT="371" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/33/p3351a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3351d.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 5: Heuristic Rule 2</DIV><P>He decided that if a puzzle can be solved by only applying the two heuristics above, then it is an <SPAN CLASS="textit">easy</SPAN> puzzle, otherwise it is <SPAN CLASS="textit">not an easy puzzle</SPAN>.

<P>A big city wants to improve its bus transportation system. One of the improvement is to add scenic routes which go es through attractive places. Your task is to construct a bus-route-plan for sight-seeing buses in a city.<P>You are given a set of scenic lo cations. For each of these given lo cations, there should be only one bus route that passes this lo cation, and that bus route should pass this lo cation exactly once. The number of bus routes is unlimited. However, each route should contain at least two scenic lo cations.<P>From location <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to location <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> , there may or may not be a connecting street. If there is a street from location <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to location <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> , then we say <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is an out-neighbor of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The length of the street from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I> (<I>i</I>, <I>j</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The streets might be one way. So it may happen that there is a street from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, but no street from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. In case there is a street from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and also a street from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the lengths <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I> (<I>i</I>, <I>j</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I> (<I>j</I>, <I>i</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> might be different. The route of each bus must follow the connecting streets and must be a cycle. For example, the route of Bus A might be from location 1 to location 2, from location 2 to location 3, and then from location 3 to location 1. The route of Bus B might be from location 4 to location 5, then from location 5 to location 4. The length of a bus route is the sum of the lengths of the streets in this bus route. The total length of the bus-route-plan is the sum of the lengths of all the bus routes used in the plan. A bus-route-plan is optimal if it has the minimum total length. You are required to compute the total length of an optimal bus-route-plan.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input file consists of a number of test cases.

<P>``Pinary" number is a positive number using only two digits ``0" and ``1" with usual rule that it must not begin with a 0, and the additional rule that two successive digits must not be both ``1".

A treasure hunter got a map of an ancient pyramid where the sacred treasure is enshrined. He started on a journey to excavate the treasure. Once he arrived at the gate of the pyramid, the earthquake occurred. As a result, some rocks fell from the ceiling to the floor on the inner pyramid. He found two rocks blocked the way to the treasure. He couldn't pull any rocks because they are too large and heavy. One thing he could do is to push a single rock moving one block forward. Now, he is going to reach to the treasure and pushing the rocks if necessary. If he will push a rock to a wrong direction, he cannot advance any more, thus he will have to give up the treasure. 

<P>
In a map of Figure 1, white blocks represent open paths and black blocks represent barriers. Black circles represent rocks, and E and T represent the position of the entrance and the treasure, respectively. A person and rocks can move to a direction of north, east, west, and south. In order to push a rock, the forward and the backward blocks of the position of the rock should be both white. In Figure 1, the person on E can push the rock on (2, 3) to north or east. But, he cannot push it to west and south because he can't move to the positions (2, 4) and (1, 3). If he will push it to east, he cannot push it to east any more because he cannot push two rocks at the same time. If he will push the rock on (2, 5) to north, the treasure will be broken down. In order to get the treasure, he has to push the rock on (2, 3) to north and then push the rock on (2, 5) to east. Notice that any rock cannot be moved outside the pyramid.

My department, Department of Computer Science, has a seminar room equipped with luxurious conveniences. Many research groups want to utilize the seminar room among others. To make out a weekly schedule of the seminar room, each research group was requested to submit a candidate time interval for its own seminar. Having realized that some candidate time intervals were overlapped, the department chairman Prof. Yang fell in a difficult situation. In order to assign the seminar room to the groups as fair as possible, he decided to request the seminar groups to submit two candidate time intervals. The two time intervals submitted by a group can be overlapped; however, one should not be contained in the other. Now, Prof. Yang's problem of preparing a weekly schedule is to assign one of the candidate time intervals submitted by each group to the group so that the time intervals assigned to groups do not overlap each other. If the finish time of one time interval coincides with the start time of the other, the two time intervals are not considered to be overlapped. 

<P>
A candidate time interval is specified by a pair of the start time and finish time. The time is written in format <TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ddd</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>:<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>hh</I></SPAN>

If three time intervals [MON 09:00 - MON 11:00], [TUE 13:25 - TUE 14:27], and [MON 23:00 - TUE 01:00] are assigned to seminar groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, the time intervals do not overlap each other, and thus all the seminar groups will be happy. 

<P>
Now, Prof. Yang wants to find an efficient method to determine, for given two candidate time intervals per each seminar group, whether or not one of the candidate time intervals can be assigned to each group so that all the time intervals assigned to groups do not overlap each other. Write a program that can help Prof. Yang.

<P>A game called janggi is a variant of chess played in Korea. It is played by two players on a board with <SPAN CLASS="MATH">9 <TT>x</TT> 10</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> size. Each player has 16 pieces of 7 kinds - 1 king, 2 chariots, 2 cannons, 2 horses, 2 elephants, 2 guards and 5 pawns. In janggi, the cannon's move has several restrictions.

<P>Tom is a chemist who has an interest in molecular structure. Recently he found a new atom and named it <SPAN CLASS="textit">tomatom</SPAN>. Two or more tomatoms are joined by bonds to make a molecule called <SPAN CLASS="textit">tomolecule</SPAN>. In chemistry, the term valency is used to indicate the number of bonds joining an atom to its neighboring atoms. Tomatoms in a tomolecule are joined satisfying the following conditions:<P><DL COMPACT><DT>(1)</DT><DD>Each tomatom is joined by at least one bond, and there can be multiple bonds between two tomatoms.</DD><DT>(2)</DT><DD>A tomolecule is connected, that is, does not have isolated components. That means there is a path composed of bonds between every two tomatoms in a tomolecule.</DD><DT>(3)</DT><DD>There is no bond between a tomatom and itself.</DD></DL><P>Currently Tom is trying to investigate the property of valency in a tomolecule. Precisely speaking, given some positive integers, Tom wants to know whether there can be a tomolecule whose valency numbers of tomatoms are same to the integers and satisfying the above conditions.<P>For example, suppose a tomolecule is composed of three tomatoms and given integers are 50, 60, and 70. For convenience, we name three tomatoms as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I><SUP>1</SUP>, <I>A</I><SUP>2</SUP>, <I>A</I><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. If there are 20 bonds between <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, 30 bonds between <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> , and 40 bonds between <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> , the valency of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I><SUP>1</SUP>, <I>A</I><SUP>2</SUP>, <I>A</I><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> are 50, 60, 70, respectively. So, there can be a tomolecule corresponding to such integers. If 10, 20, 40 are given, it is easy to know that there can be no tomolecule whose valency numbers of tomatoms are such integers. As another example, suppose four tomatoms and four integers 1, 1, 1, 1 are given, there can be no tomolecule satisfying the above condition (2).<P>You are to write a program to help Tom. For given positive integers, your program should determine whether there can be a tomolecule whose valency numbers of tomatoms are same to the integers and satisfying the above conditions. Also, in case such a tomolecule exists, your program should find one possible structure.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your program is to read from standard input.

<P>
You are going to build a new house. To know the minimum construction cost of the roof, you want to know its height. But you have the information only on the boundary of the house, so you have to compute the height of the roof from the boundary information. The formal description is as follows. The boundary of a house is defined as a rectilinear polygon with only axis-parallel edges, horizontal or vertical. Let <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> be the rectilinear polygon with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> vertices. A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">straight skeleton</SPAN> SK(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>) is a trace of the vertices of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> when <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is shrunk, each edge moving at the same speed and keeping the same direction. Figure 1 (a) and (b) show the shrinking process for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and SK(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>), respectively. 

<P>
Now we assume that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is on the XY plane, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is shrunk at unit speed while moving upward (+Z-direction) at unit speed. Then <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> traces a three dimensional polyhedral surface, called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">terrain</SPAN>, and SK(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>) can be seen as the projection of the edges of this terrain onto the XY plane. From the definition, each face of this terrain lies inside a plane that makes a dihedral angle 45Ã‚Âº with XY plane. Another fact for this terrain is that each of its faces is bounded by at least one edge of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. We call this terrain the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">roof</SPAN> of the polygon <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. For instance, Figure 1 (c) shows the roof. The height of a point <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> on the roof is the altitude, i.e., distance between <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and its projected point on the XY plane. The height of a roof is the maximum height of points on the roof. 

<P>
Your task is to compute the height of the roof of the input rectilinear polygon <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

<P>Run Length Encoding(RLE) is a simple form of compression. RLE consists of the process for searching for a repeated runs of a single character in a string to be compressed, and replacing them by a single instance of the character and a run count. For example, a string <TT>abcccddddddefgggggggggghijk</TT> is encoded into a string <TT>ab3c6def10ghijk</TT> by RLE.<P>A new compression method similar to RLE is devised and the rule of the method is as follows: if a substring <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is repeated <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> times, replace <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> copies of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I>(<I>S</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. For example, <TT>letsgogogo</TT> is compressed into <TT>lets3(go)</TT>. The length of <TT>letsgogogo</TT> is 10, and the length of <TT>lets3(go)</TT> is 9. In general, the length of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I>(<I>S</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is (number of digits in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) + (length of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) + 2 (for `(' and `)'). For example, the length of <TT>123(abc)</TT> is 8. It is also possible to nest compression, so the substring <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> may itself be a compressed string. For example, <TT>nowletsgogogoletsgogogo</TT> could be compressed as a <TT>now2(lets3(go))</TT>, and <TT>nowletsgogogoletsgogogoandrunrunrun</TT> could be compressed as <TT>now2(lets3(go))and3(run)</TT>.<P>Write a program that, for a given string, gives a shortest compressed string using the compression rules as described above.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your program is to read from standard input.

<P>
The president is in a predicament: should he select a judge with different opinions of the judges currently on the court, or should he stick with a judge like those currently on the court? Picking a candidate that shares the opinions of the existing judges on the court results in a harmonious court; on the other hand, selecting a candidate with different opinions results in a more diverse court. 

<P>
Judges are trained at law schools, and the professors and students they work with at the law school influence their thinking, and ultimately their opinions: think of a law school as a set of persons sharing common thoughts. At different times a person may belong to a different law school, even several at one time, and thus share some more common thoughts.

<P>
The thoughts are what matters. If you pick a judge, you pick the thoughts of the members of whatever law schools he or she was in - call this the first circle. Each school, however, might well share the thoughts of the additional schools all of its members were in - the second circle. You can continue to form additional circles as long as there are more members to be linked. 

<P>
Now consider a court. It's thoughts depend on the thoughts of all the law schools which the court's judges attended - the union of their first circles. Additionally, you can consider the union of the second circles - the additional schools all those school's members attended - or even further. 

<P>
You can define a distance for each member of a circle (or union of circles): assign distance 0 to the member (or entire court) at the center, distance 1 to the members in the first circle (or in the union of first circles), and so on out until distance <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> to the remaining persons in the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>'th circle (or union) that is considered.

For a candidate, this defines distance in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> circles around the candidate. For a court, this defines distance in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> unions of circles around the court. Consider a person <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> who appears in both, a candidate's <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN>

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> to the candidate's diversity, which is defined to be the sum over the contributions of all such persons <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

<P>
In the example given below, <TT>whale</TT>'s first circle contains <TT>cato</TT>, <TT>pablo</TT>, and <TT>nathan</TT>, who have distance 0, 1, and 1 from the court. Because of <TT>pablo</TT>, <TT>whale</TT>'s second circle contains <TT>jeffy</TT> and <TT>wanton</TT> with distance 1 and 2 from the court. The example considers two circles, therefore, <TT>cato</TT> contributes 2, <TT>pablo</TT> and <TT>nathan</TT> each contribute 1, and <TT>jeffy</TT> contributes 2 to <TT>whale</TT>'s diversity of 6. 

<P>
There is, however, a dark horse rule: If a candidate's circles and the court's circles do not have any members in common, the candidate is called a dark horse and cannot be considered for the court position.

You are asked to write a program that will help the president select a candidate for the court.

<P>Biologists use bacteria to clone DNA for sequencing. These bacteria are injected with the DNA that needs to be cloned and then allowed to reproduce on a large plate. As these bacteria reproduce they form colonies. Only bacteria from healthy colonies will be used for sequencing.<P>Your program will be given a pixelized snapshot of a plate, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> pixels wide and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> pixels high. Pixel <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(0, 0)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is in the upper left hand corner of the snapshot, and pixel <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>W</I> - 1, <I>H</I> - 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is at the bottom right hand corner of the snapshot. Each pixel in the snapshot is either a 0, which indicates no bacteria present at that location, or 1 indicating the presence of bacteria.<P>We are interested in finding colonies consisting of healthy bacteria that grow in a very specific way. Bacteria in these colonies have the property that when they grow, bacteria from every cell in the entire colony will grow into each of the 4 adjacent cells that have either the same row, or column as the original cell. Therefore a healthy colony consists of 5 or more cells, as illustrated by the following two examples:<P><PRE>

</PRE><P>Furthermore, to avoid cross contamination, colonies must not be too close to the edge of the plate or each other.

<P>James is not known for keeping his room very clean. Scattered about his room are rectangular boxes of computer parts, which makes it very difficult to get from one location in the room to another. Although James is not very neat, he is very careful about the way in which the boxes are placed in the room. The boxes are placed in such a way that the sides of the boxes facing a wall are parallel to the wall.<P>The challenge that James faces is to find a path, consisting of a specific number of straight line segments which end on points with integer coordinates that gets him from one location in his room to another without stepping on or over any boxes.

<P>A technician has been training the monkeys used in the lab where she works to open and close doors. Next to the lab is a long hallway that contains a number of offices which initially have closed doors. The offices in the hallway are numbered starting at 1 and ending at <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the number of offices in the hallway. Interestingly the number of monkeys in the lab is exactly equal to the number of doors in the hallway.<P>At night the technician lets the monkeys out of their cages one at a time for exercise. The first monkey that is let out of the cage runs down the hallway and opens every door (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, ...). The second monkey runs down the hallway and closes all of the even numbered doors (i.e., 2, 4, 6, 8, ...). The third monkey runs down the hallway and examines every third door (i.e., 3, 6, 9, 12, ...). The monkey will open any closed door that it examines, and close any open door that it examines. The fourth monkey examines every fourth door, and so. This process continues until all of the monkeys have been let out of their cages and allowed to run down the hallway - the last monkey will only examine the last door.<P>It would be nice to know which doors are left open at the end of the night. The technician has decided to write a grant to fund this work and has asked you for help. She needs you to write a program, that will be given as input the number of doors in a hallway - assuming that there are as many monkeys as there are doors, and that all of the doors are initially closed. Your program will output a list of numbers, one per line, that identify the doors that will be open after all of the monkeys have been let out of their cages.<P>For example, given a hallway that contains 5 doors (and 5 monkeys), after all the monkeys have been let out of their cages doors 1 and 4 will be open.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input to your program will consist of a single positive integer value that specifies the number of doors in the hallway.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your program will produce as output a list that specifies the doors that are open after all of the monkeys have been let out of their cages.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001003000000000000000">Sample Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P><PRE>

Orange computers, a fierce competitor of another well-known fruit-oriented computing company, has announced plans to develop the pPod. The pPod is an MP3 player that uses a revolutionary software system to manage its memory. Currently all pPods come with 4096 megabytes of storage. 

<P>
Songs are placed into the pPod's memory contiguously (i.e., one after another) starting at location 0. When a song is deleted, the space allocated to that song is marked as unused. The memory in the pPod can be viewed as a contiguous sequence of memory segments that either contain songs or are unused. Each memory segment is identified by a unique integer value that is equal to the address of the first byte in the segment. When adding a song to the pPod, the memory segments are scanned, in ascending order by identifier, looking for the first unused segment that is large enough to hold the song. If the segment is larger than the song, the segment is broken up into two pieces, one for the song and one for the remaining unused memory. There is memory recombination but no shifting of songs. 

<P>
You are to write program that will test your memory management system using a simple text interface.

FALSE, the Flatland Agency for Lustful Space Exploration, has just issued their TRUE proposal - Terrific Rooms Uniting Easily, a multi-billion-flop to be (recall that flop is the unit of currency in this charming two-dimensional country).

<P>
TRUE's come in two flavors: Couches, each consisting of a dome with a single tunnel, will be used as private spaces for the FALSE astronauts. Hives, each consisting of a dome with four tunnels, will connect couches and other hives and will serve as laboratories and conference rooms. 

<P>
Of course, connections are made only from one tunnel to another, and no tunnel may be left unconnected to avoid accidents in the void. Unfortunately, FALSE astronauts tend to get lost easily; therefore, the TRUE proposal explicitly forbids any tunnel connections that would form cycles or, even worse, connect a hive to itself. 

<P>
Here are a few TRUE stations:

<P>
Although (b) and (c) contain the same number of hives, they are still different from each other. Of course, they are both different from (a) which consists of two hives. (a) and (d) are equal, but for position. 

<P>
Not unlike other government agencies, FALSE believes in standards, especially in multi-billion-flop standards. They are asking that you create a LOUSY (Limit On Uniting Space Yokes) program which computes the number of different TRUE stations that can be constructed from a given number of hives.

A wooden block is standing on a large board with 1" squares. The block is one inch deep, 2 inches wide and 4 inches tall. The block is sitting on exactly two squares. The top of the block is black, the bottom is white, the front is green, the back is red, the left face is blue, and the right face is yellow. 

<P>
The block is moved to a new location on the board by rolling it. The block is rolled in such a way that one edge is always in contact with a line of the board at all times. The block never slides. 

<P>
There are four basic operations that can be performed on the block:

The sadists who design problems for ACM programming contests often like to include the abbreviation ``ACM" somewhere in their problem descriptions. Thus, in years past, the World Finals has had problems involving ``Apartment Construction Management," the ``Atheneum of Culture and Movies," the ``Association of Cover Manufacturers," ``ACM Airlines," the ``Association for Computational Marinelife," and even an insect named ``Amelia Cheese Mite." However, the number of word combinations beginning with A, C, and M that make sense is finite and the problem writers are starting to run out of ideas (it's hard to think of problems about ``Antidisestablishmentarianistic Chthonian Metalinguistics"). Fortunately, modern culture allows more flexibility in designing abbreviations - consider, for example: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
GDB - Gnu DeBugger 

<P>
LINUX - either ``LINus's UniX" or ``LINUs's miniX" or ``Linux Is Not UniX" 

<P>
SNOBOL - StriNg Oriented symBOlic Language 

<P>
SPITBOL - SPeedy ImplemenTation of snoBOL 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The rules used in these examples seem to be:  

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Insignificant words (such as ``of ", ``a", ``the", etc.) are ignored.  
</LI>
<LI>The letters of the abbreviation must app ear, in the correct order, as an ordered sublist of the letters in the significant words of the phrase to b e abbreviated.  
</LI>
<LI>At least one letter of the abbreviation must come from every significant word (multiple occurrences of a letter are, of course, treated as distinct). 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Of course these rules are often broken in real life. For instance, RADAR is an abbreviation for ``RAdio Detecting And Ranging". Under our rules (assuming that ``and" is an insignificant word), this would not be a valid abbreviation (however, RADR or RADRAN or DODGING would b e valid). You have been asked to take a list of insignificant words and a list of abbreviations and phrases and to determine in how many ways each abbreviation can b e formed from the corresponding phrase according to the rules above.

Ann Sister owns a genealogical database service, which maintains family tree history for her clients. When clients login to the system, they are presented with a variety of services: searching, printing, querying, etc. One recent question that came up which the system was not quite prepared for was the following: ``Which member of my family had the most grandchildren?" The client who posed this question eventually had to answer it by manually searching the family tree database herself. Ann decided to have software written in case this question (or ones similar to it asking for great-grandchildren, or great-great-grandchildren, etc.) is asked in the future.

Almost anyone who has ever taken a class in computer science is familiar with the ``Game of Life," John Conway's cellular automata with extremely simple rules of birth, survival, and death that can give rise to astonishing complexity. 

<P>
The game is played on a rectangular field of cells, each of which has eight neighbors (adjacent cells). A cell is either occupied or not. The rules for deriving a generation from the previous one are:  

<P>

<UL>
<LI>If an occupied cell has 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 occupied neighbors, the organism dies (0, 1: of loneliness; 4 thru 8: of overcrowding).  
</LI>
<LI>If an occupied cell has two or three occupied neighbors, the organism survives to the next generation.  
</LI>
<LI>If an unoccupied cell has three occupied neighbors, it becomes occupied (a birth occurs). 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
One of the major problems researchers have looked at over the years is the existence of so-called ``Garden of Eden" configurations in the Game of Life - configurations that could not have arisen as the result of the application of the rules to some previous configuration. We're going to extend this question, which we'll call the ``Game of Efil": Given a starting configuration, how many possible parent configurations could it have? To make matters easier, we assume a finite grid in which edge and corner cells ``wrap around" (i.e., a toroidal surface). For instance, the 2 by 3 configuration:

<P>

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>

<P>
You should note that when counting neighbors of a cell, another cell may be counted as a neighbor more than once, if it touches the given cell on more than one side due to the wrap around. This is the case for the configurations above.

You're in charge of designing a campus network between buildings and are very worried ab out its reliability and its cost. So, you've decided to build some redundancy into your network while keeping it as inexp ensive as p ossible. Sp ecifically, you want to build the cheap est network so that if any one line is broken, all buildings can still communicate. We'll call this a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">minimal reliable net</SPAN>.

<P>Little Bobby Roberts, age 8, has been dragged to yet another museum by his parents. While they while away the hours studying Etruscan pottery and Warhol soup cans, Bobby must depend on himself for entertainment. Having a mathematical bent, he recently started counting all the square tiles on the floors of the museum. He soon realized that the tiles could be grouped into larger squares that needed to be added to the count. The problem became a bit more complicated when he started counting squares contained in multiple rooms, since some squares overlapped both rooms. For example, the two rooms shown below contain a total of 86 squares: 45 <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1 <TT>x</TT> 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> squares, 28 <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2 <TT>x</TT> 2</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> squares and 13 <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3 <TT>x</TT> 3</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> squares.

Hugh F. Oh, in his never-ending quest to prove the existence of extraterrestrials, has gotten hold of a number of nighttime photographs taken by a research group that is examining glowing swamp gas. Hugh wants to see if any of the photos show, not swamp gas, but Little Grey Men in glowing suits. The photographs consist of bright dots appearing against a black background. Unfortunately, at the time the photos were taken, trains were travelling through the area (there is a train trestle over the swamp), and occasional lights from the train windows also appear in the photographs. Hugh, being a fastidious researcher, wants to eliminate these spots from the images. He can't tell from the photos exactly where the tracks are, or from what direction the photos were taken, but he knows that the tracks in that area are perfectly straight, so he's decided on the following approach: he will find the line with the maximum number of spots lying on it and, if there are four or more spots on the line, he will eliminate those points from his calculations, assuming that those are windows on the train. If two or more lines have the maximum number of points, Hugh will just randomly select one such set and delete it from the photo (he's not all that fastidious - after all, he believes in Little Grey Men). If there are fewer than four points lying along a common line, Hugh will assume that there is no train in the photograph and won't delete any points. Please write a program for him to process a set of photographs.

In the two-player game ``Two Ends", an even number of cards is laid out in a row. On each card, face up, is written a positive integer. Players take turns removing a card from either end of the row and placing the card in their pile. The player whose cards add up to the highest number wins the game. Now one strategy is to simply pick the card at the end that is the largest - we'll call this the greedy strategy. However, this is not always optimal, as the following example shows: (The first player would win if she would first pick the 3 instead of the 4.)

<P>
Even for a single architecture - or even a single processor - there may be multiple assembler (or assembly) languages with different syntax rules, different directives (or ``pseudo-ops"), and different mnemonics for the operation codes. Even the definition of integer constants can differ! 

<P>
For example, one assembler for the Intel IA-32 architecture (that is, the x86, Pentium, and Xeon), uses a letter following a number to indicate the base, while another uses C/C++/Java style constants:

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<code>1f34h =     0x1f34   </code>(a hex constant; C/C++/Java uses a leading <TT>0x</TT>) 
<BR><code>11001100b = 0xc0     </code>(binary, but no direct C equivalent, so use hex) 
<BR><code>377o =      0377     </code>(octal; C/C++/Java uses a leading zero) 
<BR><code>925 =       925      </code>(decimal; C/C++/Java decimals must NOT begin with <TT>0</TT>) 
<BR><code>925d =      925      </code>(also decimal)

<P>

<P>
<BR>
And if that wasn't sufficient, the directives used to allocate and initialize storage for constants also differ: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<code>db =      .byte          </code>(one byte) 
<BR><code>dw =      .word          </code>(two bytes) 
<BR><code>dd =      .long          </code>(four bytes) 
<BR><code>dq =      .quad          </code>(eight bytes)

<P>

<P>
<BR>
So using the assembler "A" (Intel IA-32 Architecture) we might write

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<code>db   1fh,  377o,  99d</code>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
but for assembler "B" (C/C++/Java style) we'd have to write

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<code>.byte 0x1f, 0377, 99</code>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Each line of input for this problem will contain a directive that allocates and initializes storage, written in the style of assembler ``A". Translate each such to the style required by assembler ``B" and display it. 

<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2> 
Each input line contains, in order, the following items:

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2> 
For each input line you are to display one output line. The line is to contain the equivalent assembler ``B" line for the input assembler ``A" line. Specifically, it will contain, in order, the following items:     

<P>

<UL>
<LI>exactly one tab character 
</LI>
<LI>one of the directives `<TT>.byte</TT>, `<TT>.word</TT>', `<TT>.long</TT>' or `<TT>.quad</TT>', in lowercase letters, corresponding to the directive in the input line 
</LI>
<LI>exactly one tab character 
</LI>
<LI>one or more constants, separated from each other by a comma and then a blank. Each constant must be in the style supported by assembler ``B", and (if possible) use the same base as that given for the corresponding constant in the input line. For each binary constant in the assembler ``A" form, use the hexadecimal form for assembler ``B". 
</LI>
<LI>the end of line character
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
You are <SPAN ID="txt64">not</SPAN> to consider whether the given constant will fit in the storage allocated by the directive. Thus input like `<TT>db 99999 </TT>' is acceptable, even though that value will not fit in a byte.

Leave no lizard behind! Get as many lizards as possible out of the room, and report the number of casualties.

The pillars in the room are aligned as a grid, with each pillar one unit away from the pillars to its east, west, north and south. Pillars at the edge of the grid are one unit away from the edge of the room (safety). Not all pillars necessarily have a lizard. A lizard is able to leap onto any unoccupied pillar that is within <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN>

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> but there's a catch: each pillar becomes weakened after each jump, and will soon collapse and no longer be usable by other lizards.

<P>
The following scenario takes place between 8:00AM and 9:00AM. In the headquarters of the Counter Terrorist Agency (CTA), you are tasked to aid Jack prevent the next terror attack. The CTA has been tracking the terrorists for over a week. It was discovered that the terrorists operate in separate independent groups. Each group carries a specific chemical which is harmless by itself. Though it is not readily available, possession of such chemical even in huge quantity is not illegal. Thus these groups cannot be apprehended even if they are spotted in possession of the chemical. However, if the groups meet in the same city, they can mix the chemical that they have at hand and form a nerve agent, which they can release within the next hour. 

<P>
To track down and prevent the next attack, it was determined that all groups move independently of each other using forward then left protocol in 16 cities as shown in Figure 3. The protocol means forward to the next city followed by the city on the left. In the case when there is no city in front, the group heads to the next city to the left. If there is no city to the left, the group backtracks to the previous city. In both cases, the move in the protocol is skipped, as it is replaced by the alternate movement. If there are no cities to backtrack into, (e.g. if there is no information on its previous location) the group stay put in the city and simply wait it out. 

<P>
The attack is carried out only when all groups meet in the same city. Figure 3 illustrates a map of the cities, where each city is labelled using <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I>, <I>y</I></SPAN> coordinates. Moving forward implies maintaining the same direction from previous to current. For example, if the group is currently at city 3,3 and previously at 4,3 moving forward means going to 2,3, if the group is previously at 3,4, then the group moves to 3,2; if the group is previously at 2,3, then it proceeds to 4,3 and if previously at 2,3, the group goes to 4,3. 

<P>
A <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>left</I></SPAN> implies moving counterclockwise based on the current and previous location. For example, if the group is currently at city 3,3 and previously at 4,3 moving left means going to 3,4; if the group is previously at 3,4 then the group goes to 2,3; if the group is previously at 3,2, the group moves to 4,3; and if the groups is previously at 2,3, it proceeds to 3, 2. 

<P>
It was also learned that all groups can move from one city to the next city in exactly 20 minutes. Since the group cannot be apprehended if they are carrying only the single chemical, they have to be apprehended in the act of preparing the nerve agent. Since you lack man power to track all groups simultaneously, you are tasked to determine the time and place all groups will meet to prepare the nerve agent. 

<P>
Satellite tracking can only show the whereabouts of each group at the start of the hour. Time is running out fast. When and where should you send Jack to take down these terror groups? However, if all groups were not able to meet within 24 hours, the threat alert level is dropped, as the terrorist will disband and decide on the next attack sometime in the future.

The input will contain several test cases. The first line will indicate the number of test cases. Each test case starts with the number of terror groups moving about the 16 cities. Then it is followed by the coordinate values <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> of each group taken at the start of the hour followed by the next direction either forward (F) or left (L) that they will be initially moving. For the initial movement, we will assume that a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">forward</SPAN> is a decrease in the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> coordinate and a left is a decrease in the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> coordinate value.

The output must show in which city all the groups will meet and the time (24-hour time format) in which Jack must be situated to take down the terrorist. Otherwise, it outputs a plain text stating ``no terror threat" if the groups do not converge within 24 hours.

<P>Your team is setting up a computing resource devoted to batch processing of compute-bound jobs. In addition, you have decided to use static scheduling for each period of time. Naturally, you wish to maximize the income for each set of jobs run, and <SPAN ID="txt48">you</SPAN> have been given the responsibility of finding an optimal mix of jobs for each set of candidate jobs. The jobs are submitted by an open bid process: clients will specify the amount of processor time they wish to reserve and the dollar amount that they wish to pay. If a job finishes early, the client will still pay the full amount, and if a job exceeds the requested time, it will be terminated and (of course) the client will still pay the full amount. For purposes of scheduling, your team assumes that each job will in fact use its entire scheduled time slot. In the interests of good customer relations, though, you are not to include a bid in the schedule if there is not sufficient time available to satisfy it - we're not going to over-book like the airlines do, and then hope someone doesn't use the full allotment!<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>The input file begins with a line containing a single integer (no white space) specifying the number of problem sets in the file.<P><P><BR>Each problem set consists of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>n</I> + 2)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> lines (no white space except as specified):<P><UL><LI>a single integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/33/3387img1.png ALT="$ \le$">500</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) specifying the number of candidate jobs to be scheduled </LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> lines giving the bid as an integer specifying the number of seconds followed by a single space and then a dollar amount given in decimal form (always showing two digits to the right of the decimal point) </LI><LI>a single integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> ( <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/33/3387img1.png ALT="$ \le$">2000</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) specifying the amount of time to be scheduled with these jobs </LI></UL><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>Each problem set will be numbered (beginning at one) and will generate a single line:<P><P><BR><TT>Problem <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt; <I>k</I> &gt;</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>: <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt; <I>t</I> &gt;</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> seconds scheduled for $<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>abc</I>.<I>de</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></TT><P><P><BR>where <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt; <I>k</I> &gt;</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is replaced by the problem set number, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt; <I>t</I> &gt;</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is replaced with the total time <SPAN CLASS="textit"><SPAN CLASS="textbf">actually</SPAN></SPAN> scheduled (possibly not the full input time), and <TT>$<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>abc</I>.<I>de</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></TT> is replaced by the dollar amount, given always with the leading currency symbol and with two digits to the right of the decimal point.

J.P. Flathead's Grocery Store hires cheap labor to man the checkout stations.  The people he hires (usually high school kids) often make mistakes making change for the customers.  Flathead, who's a bit of a tightwad, figures he loses more money from these mistakes than he makes; that is, the employees tend to give more change to the customers than they should get.

<P>
Flathead wants you to write a program that calculates the number of quarters ($0.25), dimes ($0.10), nickels ($0.05) and pennies ($0.01) that the customer should get back.  Flathead always wants to give the customer's change in coins if the amount due back is $5.00 or under.  He also wants to give the customers back the smallest total number of coins.  For example, if the change due back is $1.24, the customer should receive 4 quarters, 2 dimes, 0 nickels, and 4 pennies.

Agnes C. Mulligan is a fanatical bibliophile - she is constantly
buying new books, and trying to find space for those books. In
particular, she has a shelf for her ``to be read" books, where she puts
her newest books. When she decides to read one of these books, she
removes it from the shelf, making space for more books. Sometimes,
however, she buys a new book and puts it on the shelf, but because of
limited space, this pushes one or more books off the shelf at the other
end. She always adds books on the left side of the shelf, making books
fall off the right side. Of course, she can remove a book from any
location on the shelf when she wants to read one. 

<P>
Your task will be to write a simulator that will keep track of books
added and removed from a shelf. At the end of the simulation, display
the books remaining on the shelf, in order from left to right. Books in
each simulation will be identified by a unique, positive integer, <!-- MATH

types of events in the simulation:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>Add</TT>: A new book is pushed on the left end of the shelf, pushing
other books to the right as needed. No book moves to the right unless
it is pushed by an adjacent (touching) book on its left. Any book that
is not <SPAN  CLASS="textit">entirely</SPAN> on the shelf falls off the right edge. No single book will ever be wider than the given shelf.
No book that is currently on the shelf will be added again. 
</LI>
<LI><TT>Remove</TT>: If the book is on the shelf, then the book is removed
from the shelf, leaving a hole. If the book isn't on the shelf, the operation is ignored.
</LI>
<LI><TT>End</TT>: End the simulation for this case and print the contents of
the shelf.

<P>Consider the following example. A student is required to take 4 courses, <SPAN CLASS="textit">mt42</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="textit">cs123</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="textit">cs456</SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="textit">cs789</SPAN>. <SPAN CLASS="textit">mt42</SPAN> is only offered in the fall semester and has no prerequisites. Similarly, <SPAN CLASS="textit">cs123</SPAN> is only offered in the spring semester and has no prerequisites. <SPAN CLASS="textit">cs456</SPAN> is only offered in the spring semester and has both <SPAN CLASS="textit">cs123</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="textit">mt42</SPAN> as prerequisites. Finally, <SPAN CLASS="textit">cs789</SPAN> is offered in both fall and spring and has <SPAN CLASS="textit">cs456</SPAN> as its only prerequisite. The shortest time to graduate is 5 semesters, by taking <SPAN CLASS="textit">mt42</SPAN> in the fall, <SPAN CLASS="textit">cs123</SPAN> in the next spring, <SPAN CLASS="textit">cs456</SPAN> the following spring (since it is not offered in the fall) and finally <SPAN CLASS="textit">cs789</SPAN> the following fall.<P>For this problem, there are only two semesters, fall and spring. Always start counting semesters from the fall.<P>In addition to the fall/spring scheduling issues, there is one slight complication.

<P>The local toy store sells small fingerpainting kits with between three and twelve 50ml bottles of paint, each a different color.

Your platoon of wandering lizards has entered a strange room in the labyrinth you are exploring. As you are looking around for hidden treasures, one of the rookies steps on an innocent-looking stone and the room's floor suddenly disappears!

<P><P>
<BR>
Leave no lizard behind! Get as many lizards as possible out of the room, and report the number of casualties. 

<P>
The pillars in the room are aligned as a grid, with each pillar one unit away from the pillars to its east, west, north and south. Pillars at the edge of the grid are one unit away from the edge of the room (safety). Not all pillars necessarily have a lizard. A lizard is able to leap onto any unoccupied pillar that is within <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> units of his current one. A lizard standing on a pillar within leaping distance of the edge of the room may always leap to safety<SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> but there's a catch: each pillar becomes weakened after each jump, and will soon collapse and no longer be usable by other lizards. Leaping onto a pillar does not cause it to weaken or collapse; only leaping off of it causes it to weaken and eventually collapse. Only one lizard may be on a pillar at any given time.

<P>Mr. Manners teaches netiquette (``net etiquette", particularly as it applies to email) at the local community college. There are many different aspects to proper netiquette, including courtesy, correct spelling, and correct grammar. Through experience Mr. Manners has found that his college's email system does a good job of catching most spelling and grammatical errors, and he's also found that most of his students are courteous. So there are four violations of netiquette that Mr. Manners pays careful attention to, and he's devised a quick way to test for them. A message is <SPAN CLASS="textit">suspicious</SPAN> if it contains any of the following:<P><OL><LI>two adjacent uppercase letters,<BR>(because you might be SHOUTING) </LI><LI>a digit adjacent to a letter,<BR>(because you might be l33t, d00d) </LI><LI>an isolated character other than <EM>a</EM>, <EM>A</EM>, or <EM>I</EM>,<BR>(because u r probably abbreviating words; the spell checker doesn't catch this for some reason) </LI><LI>two adjacent punctuation marks, unless one of them is a double quote (the character `<TT>"</TT>').<BR>(because you might be using an emoticon :-) </LI></OL><P>For this problem, all characters in an email message are printable ASCII characters with codes in the range 32..126 (inclusive). A <SPAN CLASS="textit">punctuation mark</SPAN> is any character other than a letter, digit, or space. Two characters are <SPAN CLASS="textit">adjacent</SPAN> if they are right next to each other, with no characters in between. An <SPAN CLASS="textit">isolated character</SPAN> is one whose only adjacent characters (if any) are spaces. Your job is to write a program that can tell if a one-line email message is suspicious.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of one or more email messages, followed by a line containing only # that signals the end of the input. Each message is on a line by itself, does not begin or end with a space, and does not contain consecutive spaces. End-of-line characters occur at the end of every line (of course), but they are not considered to be part of the message. A message will contain 1..80 characters.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>For each message, output `<TT>suspicious</TT>' if it meets one or more of the four criteria defined above, and output `<TT>OK</TT>' otherwise.

<P>Some positive integers can be represented by a sum of one or more consecutive prime numbers. How many such representations does a given positive integer have? For example, the integer 53 has two representations <SPAN CLASS="MATH">5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">53</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH">41</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> has three representations <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">11 + 13 + 17</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">41</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The integer 3 has only one representation, which is 3. The integer 20 has no such representations. Note that summands must be consecutive prime numbers, so neither <SPAN CLASS="MATH">7 + 13</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> nor <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3 + 5 + 5 + 7</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is a valid representation for the integer 20.

<P>
In the good old Hachioji railroad station located in the west of Tokyo, there are several parking lines, and lots of freight trains come and go every day. 

<P>
All freight trains travel at night, so these trains containing various types of cars are settled in your parking lines early in the morning. Then, during the daytime, you must reorganize cars in these trains according to the request of the railroad clients, so that every line contains the ``right" train, i.e. the right number of cars of the right types, in the right order. 

<P>
As shown in Figure 7, all parking lines run in the East-West direction. There are exchange lines connecting them through which you can move cars. An exchange line connects two ends of different parking lines. Note that an end of a parking line can be connected to many ends of other lines. Also note that an exchange line may connect the East-end of a parking line and the West-end of another.

</DIV>

<P>
Cars of the same type are not discriminated between each other. The cars are symmetric, so directions of cars don't matter either. 

<P>
You can divide a train at an arbitrary position to make two sub-trains and move one of them through an exchange line connected to the end of its side. Alternatively, you may move a whole train as is without dividing it. Anyway, when a (sub-) train arrives at the destination parking line and the line already has another train in it, they are coupled to form a longer train. 

<P>
Your superautomatic train organization system can do these without any help of locomotive engines. Due to the limitation of the system, trains cannot stay on exchange lines; when you start moving a (sub-) train, it must arrive at the destination parking line before moving another train. 

<P>
In what follows, a letter represents a car type and a train is expressed as a sequence of letters. For example in Figure 8, from an initial state having a train ``<TT>aabbccdee</TT>" on line 0 and no trains on other lines, you can make ``<TT>bbaadeecc</TT>" on line 2 with the four moves shown in the figure.

To cut the cost out, your b oss wants to minimize the numb er of (sub-) train movements. For example, in the case of Figure 8, the numb er of movements is 4 and this is the minimum.

Given the configurations of the train cars in the morning (arrival state) and evening (departure state), your job is to write a program to find the optimal train reconfiguration plan.

<P>
In the year 2020, a race of atomically energized cars will b e held. Unlike today's car races, fueling is not a concern of racing teams. Cars can run throughout the course without any refueling. Instead, the critical factor is tire (tyre). Teams should carefully plan where to change tires of their cars. 

<P>
The race is a road race having <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> checkpoints in the course. Their distances from the start are <!-- MATH
 $a_{1}, a_{2} , \cdots$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>a</I><SUB>2</SUB>,<SUP> ... </SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I><SUB>n</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (in kilometers). The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th checkpoint is the goal. At the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th checkpoint (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> &lt; <I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>), tires of a car can be changed. Of course, a team can choose whether to change or not to change tires at each checkpoint. It takes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> seconds to change tires (including overhead for braking and accelerating). There is no time loss at a checkpoint if a team chooses not to change tires. 

<P>
A car cannot run fast for a while after a tire change, because the temperature of tires is lower than the designed optimum. After running long without any tire changes, on the other hand, a car cannot run fast because worn tires cannot grip the road surface well. The time to run an interval of one kilometer from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I> + 1</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is given by the following expression (in seconds). Here <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>

<P>
Gilbert is the network admin of Ginkgo company. His boss is mad about the messy network cables on the floor. He finally walked up to Gilbert and asked the lazy network admin to illustrate how computers and switches are connected. Since he is a programmer, he is very reluctant to move throughout the office and examine cables and switches with his eyes. He instead opted to get this job done by measurement and a little bit of mathematical thinking, sitting down in front of his computer all the time. Your job is to help him by writing a program to reconstruct the network topology from measurements. 

<P>
There are a known number of computers and an unknown number of switches. Each computer is connected to one of the switches via a cable and to nothing else. Specifically, a computer is never connected to another computer directly, or never connected to two or more switches. Switches are connected via cables to form a tree (a connected undirected graph with no cycles). No switches are `useless.' In other words, each switch is on the path between at least one pair of computers. 

<P>
All in all, computers and switches together form a tree whose leaves are computers and whose internal nodes switches (See Figure 9). 

<P>
Gilbert measures the distances between <SPAN  CLASS="textit">all pairs of computers</SPAN>. The distance between two computers is simply the number of switches on the path between the two, plus one. Or equivalently, it is the number of cables used to connect them. You may wonder how Gilbert can actually obtain these distances solely based on measurement. Well, he can do so by a very sophisticated statistical processing technique he invented. Please do not ask the details. 

<P>
You are therefore given a matrix describing distances between leaves of a tree. Your job is to construct the tree from it.

For each distance matrix, find a tree having the given distances between leaf nodes. Then output the degree of each internal node (i.e. the number of cables adjoining each switch), all in a single line and in ascending order. Numbers in a line should be separated by a single space. A line should not contain any other characters, including trailing spaces.

<h1>Problem A - Unequalled Consumption</h1>
<h3>Time limit: 4 seconds</h3--><p><center><img align="right" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/34/p3408.jpg></center>The Association of Candy Makers is preparing to launch a new product. Its idea is old with a novel twist: it simply sells boxes of candies. But since people are what they consume and everyone wants to be unique these days, the ACM wants <i>every</i> candy box to be unique, in the sense that no two boxes should contain the same composition of candy types.<p>The ACM is only able to make a small number n of different types of candy, but while limited in imagination, it is virtually limitless in resources, so it is able to produce as many as it wants of each type of candy. Furthermore, the candy types have different weights (though some may weigh the same), and in order to simplify pricing matters, the ACM wants all candy boxes to have the same total weight.<p>With these restrictions, the ACM will only be able to make a limited number of boxes. For instance, if there are three types of candy, weighing 5, 5 and 10 grams respectively, 4 different boxes can be made with total weight 10 grams (using either two of type 1, or two of type 2, or one of type 3, or one each of types 1 and 2). The ACM would like to be able to make at least one box for everyone in the cosmos. So, given queries in the form of the number of people P in the cosmos, your job is to find the smallest possible total weight w such that P different boxes containing exactly w grams of candies can be made.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>The input consists of several data sets (at most 20). Each data set consists of four lines.  The first line contains an integer 1 &le; n &le; 5, the number of candy types. The next line contains n integers w<sub>1</sub>, ..., w<sub>n</sub>, where 1 &le; w<sub>i</sub> &le; 10 is the weight (in grams) of the i:th candy type. The third line contains an integer 1 &le; q &le; 10, the number of queries. The last line of a data set contains q integers P<sub>1</sub>, ..., P<sub>q</sub>, where 1 &le; P<sub>j</sub> &le; 10<sup>15</sup> is the j:th query. Input is terminated by an incomplete data set where n = 0, which should not be processed.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>For the i:th data set, write a line <tt>"Set i"</tt>, followed by q lines giving, for each query P<sub>j</sub>, the minimal possible positive weight W<sub>j</sub> (in grams) of a candy box. If there is no weight W<sub>j</sub> such that at least P<sub>j</sub> candy boxes can be made, print <tt>"no candy for you"</tt> for that query. You may assume that W<sub>j</sub>, if it exists, will be at most 100 &middot; P<sub>j</sub>.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001003000000000000000">Sample Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><pre>

<h1>Problem B - Declaration of Content</h1>
<h3>Time limit: 4 seconds</h3--><p><center><img align="right" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/34/p3409.jpg></center>Most food you can buy at your local grocery store has a declaration of content. The declaration of content lists the ingredients of the product. It does not necessarily tell you the exact amount of every ingredient, only the ordering of the ingredients, from most common to least common. For some ingredients, an exact percentage might be given, either required by law or because the producer wants you to know how much of the fine expensive ingredients they have used. Given a set of different products and their respective declarations of content you should determine which contain the most or the least of some given ingredients. For simplicity, we assume in this problem that the percentage of each ingredient always is an integer.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of two parts.<p>The first part of a test case begins with an integer P, 1 &le; P &le; 10, the number of different products in this test case, on a line of its own. Then follows the description of the P products. Each product description consists of a line giving the name of the product, followed by a line containing an integer n, 1 &le; n &le; 100, giving the number of ingredients in this product. Then follow n lines, the i:th of which contains the name of the i:th most common ingredient of the product. In case of ties, the ingredients will be listed in arbitrary order. Optionally, every ingredient name can be followed by space, an integer p, 0 &le; p &le; 100 and a percentage sign. If this is present, it specifies the exact amount of this ingredient in the product. Otherwise, because all percentages in this problem are integers, the ingredient makes up at least one percent of the total product.<p>The second part of a test case begins with an integer Q, 1 &le; Q &le; 100, the number of queries. Then follow Q lines, each containing a query. A query is of the form <tt>"least X"</tt>, or <tt>"most X"</tt>, where X is the name of an ingredient. In the <tt>"most X"</tt> case, the ingredient X is guaranteed to be present in at least one of the products.<p>A name of a product or an ingredient is a string of alphabetic characters (A-Z and a-z), digits (0-9) and underscore. Case is significant. No name will be longer than 30 characters. You may assume that each declaration of content is valid.<p>The last test case to be processed is followed by a line consisting of the integer 0.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>The output consists of one line for every query in the input data. For each query, output the name of the product containing the most or the least of ingredient X, as indicated by the query. If there are several possible such products, output all of them, in the same order as the products were presented in the test case input data. The product names should be separated by a single space.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001003000000000000000">Sample Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><pre>

<h1>Problem C - Laserbox</h1>
<h3>Time limit: 1 second</h3--><p><center><img align="right" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/34/p3410.jpg></center>A laserbox is a game involving some optical equipment. The game board is a square n&times;n grid. On each grid point, a gadget called a right-turner can be placed and several such gadgets are included. Finally, there is a ruby laser, and if the laser is mounted at the bottom end of a column, the beam will be directed northwards through that column. Analogously, the laser beam may be directed southwards from the top of a column, eastwards from the start of a row or westwards from the end of the row.<p>The game starts with some right-turners being spread out on some grid points and the laser (switched off) being mounted somewhere along the border of the rectangle. The player then tries to deduce where the beam will emerge when the laser is switched on. The effect of a right-turner is to deflect the beam ninety degrees to the right, regardless of from which of the four directions it enters.<p>Your program must do exactly what the player is supposed to do.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>On the first line of the input is a single positive integer, telling the number of test cases to follow. The first line of each test case consists of two integers n r, where 1 &le; n &le; 50 is the size of the board and 1 &le; r &le; 50 the number of right-turners. The following r lines contain the coordinates x y of the right-turners. No two right-turners will have the same coordinates.<p>Finally, a line with two integers indicating the laser position follows. The bottom of column six is denoted by 6 0 and the start of row seven by 0 7. If the zeroes are replaced by n+1, the laser is placed at the top of column six and the end of row seven, respectively.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>For each test case, output one line containing the coordinates X Y of the beam as it leaves the board. The same rules as for the laser apply, so X may equal 0 or n+1 or else Y equal 0 or n+1. If the beam gets caught and does not leave the board, the output should be 0 0.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001003000000000000000">Sample Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><pre>

<h3>Time limit: 4 seconds</h3--><p><center><img align="right" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/34/p3412.jpg></center>"Pesky Heroes!" &mdash; the evil mage stormed into his throneroom &mdash; "They don't have <itany</i> respect for us evil masterminds anymore. They've gone and invaded my cave again, and while the traps were down for maintenance! And they've set up their camp in the cave! The nerve!"<p>"But, milord, then surely they will be doomed when the traps have been re-activated," were the last words of a servant, uttered milliseconds before he... well, you get the picture. "Not necessarily, I may have to teleport my trained orcs to seal their fate. You there, figure out where I should send them. Now!"<p>Inspired by the fate of the last servant to speak, you hurry off with a map of the cave. The map is a complete map of the cave, with the positions of all traps marked, and you see that the cave has a single entrance. On the map, there are n strategic <i>key points</i> which have been marked with the numbers 1 to n. All passages in the cave connect two key points. All traps have been placed at key points, and all dead ends are key points. Your mathematically inclined mind quickly discovers that for every key point there are at most three passages connecting to it.<p>Your master can open a magic gateway from the throneroom to any passage (but not to key points), and the trained orcs will be sent in. Despite their long training, the orcs are still not too bright. When they've gone through the gateway, they will begin walking away from the light coming from the entrance (there will always be a unique path from each point in the cave to the entrance). In each intersection, they will normally always choose the left path, and when they come back to the gateway, they will come back to the throneroom, ready to be teleported to a new location, if necessary.<p>These orcs have been trained, so they're smarter than the average bear, erm, orc. You can give them a number t when they walk in, and the t:th time they are at an intersection, they will turn right instead of left. Despite their eight years of training, they can still only be trusted to remember one number until they return.<p>"Oh, and one last thing. I saw the heroes in my crystal ball, they've set up camp in a dead-end.", the mage shouts after you.<p>To maximize your chances of survival, you want your master to have to work as little as possible (i.e. to open as few gateways as possible), but you must have the orcs search every dead-end in the cave which can reach the entrance without passing any traps. The orcs are very dear to your master, so you better make sure they don't walk into any traps!<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>The input will consist of several data sets.

<h1>Problem G - Tantrix</h1>
<h3>Time limit: 4 seconds</h3--><p><center><img align="right" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/34/p3414a.png></center>Tantrix is a two player game played with 56 hexagonal tiles. Each tile contains three <i>links</i> in different colours. Both players have five tiles in hand and take turns in placing them on the playing field. The figure to the right shows how the game could have progressed after nine played tiles.<p>There are four different link colours: red, green, yellow and blue. No two tiles are identical, and no tile is rotation symmetric. A tile will be described in the input as a six letter string, specifying the link colours in clockwise direction. The uppercase letters <tt>'R'</tt>, <tt>'G'</tt>, <tt>'Y'</tt> and <tt>'B'</tt> will be used for red, green, yellow and blue, respectively.<p>In this problem, a move is defined as placing one of the tiles in hand somewhere on the playing field, subject to these rules:<ul><li>A tile must always be placed next to tiles already played. <li>The links in all touching tiles must match colour. <li>An empty space which is surrounded by three tiles is called a <i>forced space</i>. If the player can place one of his tiles in a forced space, he must do so. If there are several forced spaces, and several ways to place a tile in a forced space, he may select any of those. <li>It's not allowed to place a tile so that a forced space is created containing three links of the same colour (since no tile could ever be placed there). <li>The two sides along a forced space are called <i>controlled sides</i>. It's not allowed to place a tile along a controlled side.</ul><p><center><img align="right" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/34/p3414a.png></center>If there are one or more forced spaces and the player can't place any of his tiles in hand in those spaces, he will have to play any other legal move. Note that a player may not be allowed to place a tile in a forced space due to rule 4.<p>The figure on the right illustrates these rules. There are three forced spaces. The interposed tile may not be placed in the lower left forced space, as that would create a new forced space with three red links. The dark gray spaces lie on controlled sides created by the forced spaces; no tiles may be placed there. If the player to move can't place a tile in any of the three forced spaces, he must place a tile in any of the white spaces.<p>Your task is to count the number of legal moves the player to move has, given the position and orientation of already played tiles and the tiles in hand for the player to move. If a tile can be placed at several locations, or in several orientations, each such combination is counted as a distinct move.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p><center><img align="right" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/34/p3414a.png></center>The first line in the input will contain the number of cases (at most 50).<p>Each case begins with a single line containing an integer n (1 &le; n &le; 20), the number of tiles that have already been played. Then follow n lines containing the coordinates and description of these tiles. The first character in the tile description belongs to the link facing up; the remaining colours follow as per usual in clockwise direction. Then follows a line with the description of the five tiles in hand, the tile descriptions being separated with a single space.<p>The mapping between the spaces and the coordinates is shown in the figure below (note that the playing field is infinite and not restricted to these coordinates). All tiles in the input will be valid and distinct. The layout will represent a position that could have arisen from a legal game. One of the played tiles will have coordinates 0,0.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><p>For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the number of legal moves.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001003000000000000000">Sample Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><pre>

<h3>Time limit: 1 second</h3--><p><center><img align="right" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/34/p3416.jpg></center>John is moving to the penthouse of a tall sky-scraper. He packed all his stuff in boxes and drove them to the entrance of the building on the ground floor. Unfortunately the elevator is out of order, so the boxes have to be moved up the stairs.<p>Luckily John has a lot of friends that want to help carrying his boxes up. They all walk the stairway at the same speed of 1 floor per minute, regardless of whether they carry a box or not. The stairway however is so narrow that two persons can't pass each other on it. Therefore they deciced to do the following: someone with a box in his hands is always moving up and someone empty-handed is always moving down. When two persons meet each other somewhere on the stairway, the lower one (with a box) hands it over to the higher one (without a box). (And then the lower one walks down again and the higher one walks up.) The box exchange is instantaneous. When someone is back on the ground floor, he picks up a box and starts walking up. When someone is at the penthouse, he drops the box and walks down again.<p>After a while the persons are scattered across the stairway, some of them with boxes in their hands and some without. There are still a number of boxes on the ground floor and John is wondering how much more time it will take before all the boxes are up.

<P>The display of the percentage of games won for various computer-based games is frequently reported as an integer, with any fractional part truncated.

<P>A long time ago - before aluminum cans and plastic bottles, Coke used to actually come in glass bottles. A case of Coke consisted of a box or carton that had 24 bottles, arranged as 4 rows of 6 bottles each.

You can ``jump over" a bottle, either horizontally or vertically, and remove the bottle you have jumped over. That is, you can move a bottle over another bottle to an empty space in the box, and then remove the bottle over which you jumped.

<P>
The game of Blackjack (as defined here) is played with a deck containing no more than 500 cards, on each of which is printed an integer in the range 1 to 10. In each game there are two players: you and the house. At the beginning of each game the first card is dealt to you, the next is dealt to the house, the next one to you, and finally another is dealt to the house. 

<P>
The goal of the game is to obtain a set of cards with a total larger than your opponent's total, without exceeding 21. A card containing the integer ``1" can be counted as either 1 or 11, as desired by the player. This rule applies to you and to the house. After the first four cards are dealt, you may draw as many additional cards from the deck as you wish, but you must stop if your total exceeds 21. Then the house is required to draw cards from the deck until its total is 17 or larger (counting a 1 as 11, if possible, without exceeding 21). 

<P>
When both you and the house have finished taking cards, the totals of the cards you each hold are compared to determine the outcome. If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is your total and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the house total, here are the six possible outcomes:

In this problem you are told the number and order of the cards in the deck, and are to determine the manner in which you should play (that is, how many cards you should draw in each game) in order to obtain the most favorable outcome (for you). A win is better than a tie, and a tie is better than a loss. Play as many games as possible. If necessary, reuse the deck (in exactly the same order as originally input) from its beginning to complete the last game. Draw the smallest number of cards required to yield the best possible outcome for each game (for you). 

<P>
Let's consider an example. Suppose the deck contains the cards 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, in that order. At the beginning of the first game you would have 1 and 3 (a total of 14, counting the 1 as 11) and the house would have 2 and 4. If you choose to draw no more cards, the house then would draw 5 and 6, yielding a total of 17, and the house would win. If you had taken one more card, you'd then have 1, 3 and 5 (a total of 19, again counting the 1 as 11); the house would then draw 6 and 7, yielding a total of 19 - a tie. If you took 2 additional cards, you'd then have 1, 3, 5, and 6 (a total of 15, counting the 1 as a 1), and house would draw 7 and 8 for a total of 21 - you would lose. Finally, if you try taking 3 additional cards, you would have 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7, for a total of 22. The house would draw 8 and 9, for a total of 23. This would also be a tie, since both you and the house exceeded 21. The first tie (with a total of 19) required the smallest number of cards to yield the best possible outcome, so you draw only one card in this game. 

<P>
Since the deck has not yet been exhausted, we can play another game. The first card not used in the previous game was 8, so you are dealt 8 and 10. The house is dealt 9 and 1 (since we start reusing the deck to complete the game). You have 18, and the house has 20 (counting the 1 as 11), so the house would win. If you take an additional card, you'd have 8, 10, and 2 giving a total of 20. The house has a total of 20, so this would be a tie. If you take two additional cards you'd have 8, 10, 2 and 3, for a total of 23. The house, with 20, would still win. The best outcome for you is a tie.

<P>
Since the deck has been completely used, no more games can be played; the best outcome is 0 wins, 2 ties, and 0 losses (for you).

<P>A contour map consists of some number of regions, frequently corresponding to geographic areas. One use for such maps is to show elevations and surface configuration. These usually have various lines corresponding to equal elevations. You may also see contour maps used in weather, to illustrate regions of equal barometric pressure or temperature. Even J. B.

<P>Agnes C. Mulligan is a fanatical bibliophile. She is continually buying new books. She has a shelf where she puts her newest books. When she decides to read one of these books, she removes it from its location on the shelf, leaving a ``hole" equal to the width of the book. When she buys a new book she places it on the left side of the shelf, which may push one or more books already on the shelf toward the right. This action may cause one or more books to fall off the right end of the shelf.<P>Your task is to write a program that simulates the addition of books to, and the removal of books from a shelf with a given width.

<P>
When scheduling the use of a resource (like a CPU), one measure of the schedule is the average length of time a client has to wait for the resource. That is, after a client indicates they want to use the resource, and for how long they want to use it, how long must they wait? This clearly depends on how many other clients want to use the resource, and when they are allowed to use it. 

<P>
Assume that a particular resource is scheduled in integral units of time (for example, milliseconds), and that once a client is granted the use of the resource, they have complete (unshared) use of the resource for the length of time they requested. A schedule is just the order in which a group of clients are allowed to use the resource. 

<P>
Suppose we know, in advance, the length of time each client wants to use the resource. Your task in this problem is to determine the minimum average time clients must wait before being allowed to use the resource.

For example, suppose we have three clients that want to use the resource. One (client A) wants it for 10 units of time. Another (client B) wants the resource for 13 units of time. Client C wants to use the resource for 6 units of time. If we let client A use the resource first, it waits 0 units of time. If we let B use it second (after A), then B waited a total of 10 units of time  exactly the length of time the resource was used by client A. Finally, client C uses the resource after waiting 10 units of time for A to finish and another 13 units of time for B to finish. So C had to wait 23 units of time. The average wait time is (0 + 10 + 23) / 3, or 11 units of time. As it turns out, the best schedule would require an average wait time of only 7 1/3 units of time.

<P>
The input will contain multiple cases. The number of cases is specified by the first integer in the input. The input for each case will consist of an unknown number of requests for the use of the resource. Each of these is represented by a positive integer separated from the others by whitespace. The last request in each case is followed by a negative number.

The Acme Extrusion Company specializes in the production of steel bars with custom-designed cross-sections. The manufacturing process involves cutting a hole in a thick metal plate, the shape of the hole being determined by the customer's specifications. 

<P>
Molten metal is then forced through the hole to form a long bar. The shape of the hole determines the shape of the cross-section of the resulting bar. 

<P>
Given a description of a polygonal hole and the volume of molten metal available, determine how long a bar can be formed by this process.

You recently installed a stylish clock in your office that is perfectly round and has no markings that identify its orientation. After accidentally bumping it, you realized that 12 o'clock might no longer be at the top. Nonetheless, you want to figure out what time it is. Fortunately you recently overheard A a coworker giving the time and you have a protractor and can measure the angle between the hour and minute hands.

<P>
A common approach to navigating garden mazes is to, upon entry to the maze, to place one's hand upon the wall to right of the entrance, and then to walk forward, keeping that right hand in contact with a wall at all times. 

<P>
It's well known that this technique allows one to pass through one-entrance, one-exit mazes, but it does not always suffice with mazes where one is supposed to reach some goal location or locations in the interior of the maze. 

<P>
Write a program to read in a description of a maze marked with a goal location and one or more entrances, and to determine whether the goal can be found by applying the right-hand rule until the goal is found or until the rule causes you to pass outside the maze through one of the entrances. 

<P>
We assume that people walking through the maze will look around as they do so. Consequently, a goal is considered to have been ``found" if the person steps directly onto that location or reaches any position with an unimpeded view to the goal along a vertical or horizontal line.

<P>
Plinko is a game played on a nearly vertical board populated with offset
rows of pegs.  The player chooses one of five slots in the top of the
board, drops the chip into it, and watches as the chip bounces down the
board.  Each time the chip encounters a peg, it will either bounce left
or right.  On a fair Plinko board, the chance would be an even 50 percent
each way (except on the board edges, where only one choice exists).
The chip eventually ends up at the bottom row, with the ending column
determining the prize.

<P>
As a player in a dishonest Plinko tournament, you know that all the
boards are rigged.  The chances for the chip to go right or left at
each peg are not always fair.  Luckily, you have found a set of
schematics that show the percentage chance that a chip will go right
for each peg on each board.  Now you just need a program to calculate the
odds of particular drop point leading to the chip landing in specified
columns.

<P>
Here's an example of how a fair Plinko game's probabilities would look:

<P>

<P>

<PRE> 
	a chip starts in one of five lettered
	columns at the top:
	                           prob. chip will go right

Here is one possible path for a chip dropped in the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">A</SPAN> column:

<P>

<P>
<BR>

	# | # B # C # D # E #      prob. chip will go right:

What are the odds that this exact path would be taken?  Well, the
probability that it would first go right was 1/1, the second move (left)
was 1/2, the third move (right) was 1/1, and the last move (right) was
1/2.  This means the probability of this path being taken was:

	1/1 * 1/2 * 1/1 * 1/2 = 1/4 = 25%

However, there are other paths the chip could have taken to arrive at the
bottom row in column <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">B</SPAN>, and they would also have to be considered when
determining the probability that the chip would end up in that particular
spot.

<P>
Notice that the pegs directly below the `A' and `E' marks have special
values.  Since these columns are on the edge of the board, there is only
one way for the chip to go.  Even the rigged boards follow that rule.

As a homework assignment, you have been tasked with creating a program
that provides the meanings for many different words.  As you dislike
the idea of writing a program that just prints definitions of
words, you decide to write a program that can print definitions of many
variations of just a handful of different root words.  You do this by
recognizing common prefixes and suffixes.  Since your program is smart
enough to recognize up to one prefix and one suffix per word, it can
process many forms of each word, significantly reducing the number of
rote definitions required.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
For this problem, you'll be writing the prefix/suffix processing
portion of the program.

Peg games may be played on a variety of boards, but the goal is always
the same, to end the game with as few pegs on the board as possible.
This is accomplished by making a sequence of moves, where one peg `jumps'
an adjacent peg to the empty space on the opposite side.  Pegs which are
jumped by other pegs are immediately removed.

<P>
Given the starting configuration of a peg board, your program should
determine the number of pegs that will remain on the board if the player
makes the best possible sequence of moves.

<P>
One standard peg board is a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">5 <TT>x</TT> 5</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> cross (shown below with periods indicating
empty peg holes and pound signs indicating non-playable space).  Figure A
shows an empty board.  Figure B shows a board with five pegs, indicated by
lower-case letter <TT>o</TT>'s. and Figure C shows the result of an optimal
sequence of moves from Figure B's starting position.  Note that this ends
with 1 peg, the best possible result for any game.  Also note that the
optimal sequence of moves used to generate Figure C is not unique; there
are at least two sets of moves that leave only one peg.

<P>Janken, also known by the name <EM>rock paper scissors</EM>, is a popular Japanese childrens' game. In the grand tradition of game development, one company has decided to put a strategic twist on a classic title. The resulting war ``simulation," <EM>Janken Tactics</EM>, is in development as we speak. You have been hired onto the team as a programmer, and put to work on the move validation code.<P><P><BR><EM>Janken Tactics</EM> takes place on a map represented by a hex-hex grid with five cells on each side. Each cell on the grid has a certain <EM>terrain type</EM>, which helps or hinders movement through the cell. Normally, moving into an adjacent cell costs one <EM>movement point</EM>, but the terrain on that cell may cause it to cost more:<P><P><BR><UL><LI>Moving into a <B>F</B>ield costs no extra movement points (one total); </LI><LI>Moving into the <B>W</B>oods costs one extra movement point (two total); </LI><LI>Moving into the <B>H</B>ills costs two extra movement points (three total); </LI><LI>Moving into the <B>M</B>ountains costs three extra movement points (four total); </LI><LI>and no units may move into <B>U</B>nderwater cells. (They will not start in an underwater cell either.) </LI></UL><P><P><BR>The layout and coordinate system for the hexagonal grid is as follows:<P><PRE> 
      4 5 6 7 8 9
     3 \ \ \ \ \ \

          * * * * * -- I
</PRE>with letters coming first in the coordinate system. The center cell of the top row is A7, the rightmost point of the grid is E9, and so on. On the hex grid above, adjacent cells are those to the immediate left and right and those immediately along the diagonals. For example, the cells adjacent to E5 are D5, D6, E4, E6, F4, and F5.<P>As one might expect of a game based on Janken, there are three unit types: the <EM>Guardian</EM> (rock), the <EM>Mage</EM> (paper), and the <EM>Swordsman</EM> (scissors). Units also have <B>10</B> movement points that they can expend per move. And, as in Janken, the units each have their strengths and weaknesses:<P><UL><LI>Guardians can defeat Swordsmen but are defeated by Mages; </LI><LI>Mages can defeat Guardians but are defeated by Swordsmen; </LI><LI>and Swordsmen can defeat Mages but are defeated by Guardians. </LI></UL><P>You are not working on the combat code for <EM>Janken Tactics</EM>, but the strengths and weaknesses are important for another reason: during a move, a unit cannot pass over an enemy unit, <B>NOR</B> can they pass within one cell of an enemy unit that is strong against them (that is, a Guardian cannot pass within one cell of a Mage, a Mage cannot pass within one cell of a Swordsman, and a Swordsman cannot pass within one cell of a Guardian). They may, however, end a move in a cell adjacent to (but not the same as) any enemy unit, and may pass through cells occupied by allied units of all types. The destination cell must not have any unit (allied or enemy) inside.

<P>Conway's Game of Life is a simulation run on a square grid of cells. Each cell is either <EM>alive</EM> or <EM>dead</EM>, and each turn of the simulation is based on the contents of the previous turn; that is, each cell's state in turn <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> + 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is based on its state in turn <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> along with the states of the eight cells surrounding it. In the standard Game of Life, a cell remains alive if it has two or three neighbours, and an empty cell becomes alive if it has precisely three neighbours: otherwise, a cell <EM>dies</EM> or stays empty. The figure below shows three generations of a simple but surprisingly complex Conwayian structure called a glider:<P><PRE>

</PRE><P>As one can see, the entire structure has in fact moved one cell up and one cell to the left after four turns. There are many other much more complex structures in the Game of Life; it is even possible to build a (very, very slow) Turing Machine on the grid, or simulate the Game of Life itself!<P><P><BR>The <EM>ruleset</EM> for the original Game of Life can be described as <B>23/3</B>; that is, a cell stays alive in turn <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> + 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> if it has two or three live neighbours in turn <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and a dead cell turns live if it has precisely three neighbours. There are many other ``Conway-like" rulesets that can be described with the same notation. Note that a ruleset like <B>/234</B> (that is, all currently live cells die, but any dead cells with two, three, or four neighbors come alive) is perfectly valid (and quite interesting); rulesets with no ``birth values" are also valid but (unsurprisingly) dull. Your goal is to simulate a number of these rules...at the same time on the same grid.<P>Because there is more than one ruleset running on the same grid, a number of clarifications are required:<P><UL><LI>Each cell can be occupied by at most one cell from one species (a ruleset represented by a particular letter); </LI><LI>Only cells of the same species count towards the state of the next turn for that species; </LI><LI>When there is a conflict as to the state of a cell in the next turn, resolution is as follows:<OL><LI>If one ruleset will place a live cell and all others leave the cell dead, place a live cell of the ruleset that allows it; </LI><LI>If more than one ruleset will place a live cell in that location, the ruleset whose representation is first in alphabetical order wins (that is, if species B and D would both have a live cell in a location, the cell becomes a live cell with species B.) </LI></OL></LI><LI>One can assume that the board is surrounded by an infinite number of dead cells that cannot become alive. </LI></UL><P>After running a simulation for a given number of turns, you are to report the maximum and minimum population of each species involved.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> indicating the number of simulations in the file.

<P>
An enterprising group of Swamp County College business students have thought of an idea to improve the lives oftheir fellow students and perhaps make a few dollars at the same time. They want to automate comparison-shopping for groceries so students can stretch their food budgets. A student who wants to use the service submits a list of commonlypurchased groceries along with some other parameters about their shopping habits, and the service responds with the store that will give him or her the best deal on those items that week. The business students hope either to market theservice or to attract sponsors who will support it.

<P>
The business students want your team to develop the software that will take each student's shopping list anddetermine which of up to five nearby stores will provide the lowest net total cost for the selected items. They will hire other students to collect and enter the data from promotional advertising and in-store visits.

<P>
Students vary in the amount of effort they will put in to stretch their grocery dollars. Some will clip coupons,others won't. Some will accept house-brand substitutes from certain stores, others insist on brand-name goods. Your program is to take all this into account when determining which store offers the best deal for each student.

<P>
Some supermarkets offer to double manufacturer's coupons on brand-name items as a promotional tool. Storesthat do this share common policies about the promotion: a coupon will only be doubled up to a maximum of one dollar, and the most you can get by using a coupon that is doubled is to get the promoted item for free. A coupon for $1.50 would be worth a total of $2.50 at a store that doubles coupons. An item that costs $1.75 before using a "doubled" $1.00 off coupon would be free-but the shopper doesn't get an additional 25 cents back.

<LI>The next <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> lines contain information about the stores in the neighborhood. Each line contains the letter ``<TT>Y</TT>"or ``<TT>N</TT>", a single space, and the store name. ``<TT>Y</TT>" indicates that the store doubles coupons; ``<TT>N</TT>" indicates that the store does not double coupons.
</LI>
<LI>The following 2-500 lines contain comma-delimited lists with the inventory, one item per line. The item identifier is followed by the brand-name item price and the house-brand substitute price at each store in the order of thestores given in the list. This list is terminated by an empty line (that is, a line that contains nothing but the end-of-line character.)
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The remainder of the input contains the names of student shoppers, their lists of items, flags showing whether or notthey will allow house-brand substitution for each item at each store, and the value of any brand-name manufacturer's
coupon they have for each item. The student names are on lines that begin with asterisks. The lines that follow astudent's name represent the items in that student's shopping list. Each shopping list entry consists of the name of the desired item (possibly in a case other than the way it appears in the inventory list), followed by the character ``<TT>Y</TT>" or ``<TT>N</TT>"indicating acceptance or rejection of house-brand items at each store, optionally followed by the amount of any valid manufacturer's coupon that the shopper has. Commas separate fields from each other. The house-brand substitutionflags appear in the same order as the stores in the inventory list. A shopping list ends when either a new student name appears or the end-of-file is reached.

<P>
All store names and item names are unique. Names of stores, items, and students consist of between one andthirty alphanumeric characters, hyphens, apostrophes, and periods. All stores have house-brand substitutes for every brand-name item. All stores have all items in stock. Shoppers are purchasing only one of each item. No item costsmore than $499.

Your output should consist of a series of lines corresponding to the shoppers in the same order they appear inthe input. Each line should contain the name of the shopper starting in the first column, a space, the name of the recommended store, a space, and the total amount of money needed printed in dollars and cents (including the leadingdollar sign). Since the stores appear in the list in distance order from the campus, if multiple stores offer the same net total price, recommend the store that appears earliest in the list.

You are working for a major credit card company. Your group maintains the software that approves or declinescustomer applications for credit. For many years the trusty mainframe called ``Big Momma" has worked day and night processing credit card applications for the company. But she has become ill, and since she was built over thirty yearsago, spare parts are not available. Your job is to reproduce the algorithms and code that ``Big Momma" used in a modern programming language, using a modern computer system.

<P>
The only code that is available on ``Big Momma" is compiled COBOL, so you will have to rely on the businesspolicy makers for the current credit card policies.

<P>Many new automobiles have built-in fuel consumption meters that report how far the vehicle can travel beforerunning out of fuel (the <SPAN CLASS="textit">distance to empty</SPAN>, or <SPAN CLASS="textit">DTE</SPAN>) based upon the car's current gas mileage (miles per gallon).Unfortunately, older cars have only an odometer and a fuel gauge. An upstart PDA maker has contracted your team to write a program that can report the same information for older cars based upon the most recently computed gas mileage.Instead of a real-time display of distance to empty, your program needs to report the odometer reading at which the gas tank is expected to be empty.<P>To predict an odometer reading, the driver must enter information in the PDA about the odometer reading andquantity of fuel purchased when refueling. Because there is no fuel consumption meter to compare against an odometer, the only accurate way to compute gas mileage is between fill-ups. Furthermore, the driver is not expected to know thecapacity of the fuel tank-your program must infer the tank capacity by tracking refuelings and observing the greatest amount of fuel purchased in a single refueling up through the current time.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Input to your program is a log of PDA entries, with one line per refueling. Each line contains four values separatedby whitespace: the date (in the form dd-Mon-yyyy), the amount of gas purchased (a floating point constant), the cost of the fuel in dollars and cents (a floating point constant), and the integer odometer reading. If the tank was refueled tocapacity, the odometer reading is a positive value. If the gas tank was not topped off, the odometer reading is recorded as a non-positive number. You do not have to worry about the odometer either starting at zero or rolling over throughzero: those features are deferred until the release of the more costly deluxe version of your program.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your program is to print a series of lines representing fuel purchase dates and the PDA's predicted DTE odometerreading as of those dates. For each PDA entry, print a line containing the date, a single space, and the predicted empty-tank odometer reading, rounded to the nearest mile. When there is insufficient information to predict a DTEodometer reading, print the phrase ``<TT>watch the fuel gauge</TT>" in place of a value.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001003000000000000000">Sample Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P><PRE>

<P>When the <EM>Tattler</EM> introduced a Sudoku puzzle in their ``Entertainment Section" (do they have anything else in their so-called newspaper?), Eliza Hargroves, editor-in-chief of the <SPAN CLASS="textit">Informer</SPAN>, was understandably upset. She had beencontemplating adding one to her own ``Amusements" section, but her motto is ``the <SPAN CLASS="textit">Informer</SPAN> always leads", and howcould she lead in Sudoku when the <SPAN CLASS="textit">Tattler</SPAN> had already beat her to it?<P>Then the thought struck her-Sudoku is based on three-by-three squares of three-by-three squares. If the <SPAN CLASS="textit">Informer</SPAN> came up with a puzzle based on four-by-four squares of four-by-four squares, it would be bigger and better than Sudoku, and put the <SPAN CLASS="textit">Informer</SPAN> firmly in the lead.<P>Naming her new puzzle ``4square", she asked a friend at the local university to work out the details and providesome sample puzzles for the paper. A week or so later, he delivered the puzzles and promptly left on an extended visit to his family's ancestral home in some remote part of Africa.<P>He left her enough puzzles and solutions for all the time he would be away, but didn't provide any guide to howdifficult the puzzles were. That's where your team comes in. Your task is to write a program that will read a 4square puzzle and determine whether it is easy, moderate or hard.<P>The rules are similar to Sudoku. You are given a 16-by-16 grid of squares that is subdivided into a 4-by-4 grid ofboxes containing 4-by-4 grids. A number of the squares have hexadecimal digits in them (one of ``0", ``1", ``2", ``3", ``4", ``5", ``6", ``7", ``8", ``9", ``A", ``B", ``C", ``D", ``E" or ``F"). To solve the puzzle, a hexadecimal digit must be placed ineach of the remaining squares, so that only one of each digit appears in every row, column or 4-by-4 box. Each puzzle has a unique solution.<P>Three puzzle solving rules can be derived directly from the basic puzzle rules. If a square has a digit assigned toit, then no other square in the row, column or box that the square is in can be assigned the same digit. If, through the application of the other rules, there is only one digit that can be assigned to a square, then it must be assigned to thatsquare. If, through the application of the other rules, only one square in a row, column or box can be assigned a certain digit, then it must be assigned that digit, no matter how many other digits seem to be possible for that square. A puzzlethat can be solved by applying these rules is considered easy.<P><P><BR>Working with these puzzles, further rules can be deduced.<P>One can be called the rule of exclusive shares. A row or column shares four different squares with each of the fourboxes it crosses. If, through applying the rules, a certain digit can appear in a row or column only in the squares shared with a single one of the boxes, then that digit cannot appear in any other squares in that box, since if it did, there wouldbe no square in that row or column where that digit could appear. Similarly, if a digit can only appear in a certain row or column in a box, it cannot appear in any other box along that row or column in the puzzle.<P>Another rule can be called the rule of cliques, since it's used to throw out squares or digits that are not in the clique. If two squares in a row, column or box have only two digits that they could contain, then those digits cannot appear in any other square in that group, since, if it did, you would be left with two squares in the group that must be assigned the same digit. Similarly, if there are two digits that can only be placed in either of the same two squares, then no other digits could appear in either of those squares, since, if they did, there would be no square in the group to place one ofthose two digits. This rule can be extended to cliques of more than two squares or digits. Note that, with more than two squares or digits, not all of the digits need to be possible in all of the squares in the clique. A square with 0 and 1as possibilities, another with 1 and 2, and another with 0 and 2 could form a clique of three, if the other requirements are met. Note also that the two rules for finding cliques are exclusive. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> digits must only be possible in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> squares, or <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> squares must only have <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> possible digits. If it appears that one of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> squares can have a digit that's not in the clique and one of the digits in the clique can appear in a square that's not in the clique, then, if it's a clique at all, it's a clique of more than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> members.<P>Puzzles that require the application of these two additional rules are considered moderate, while puzzles that cannot be solved using any of these rules, but must be solved using more complex rules, or through guessing and backtracking if the guess was wrong, are considered hard.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your input will be read from the standard input stream, and will contain some number of puzzles terminated byend-of-file. Each puzzle will contain 16 lines of 16 characters each. Each character will be either a hexadecimal digit to indicate the value of the corresponding square, or a period (<TT>.</TT>) for a square whose value must be solved. Puzzles will be separated from each other by a single empty line. A single newline character will immediately follow the last character (if any) in each line, terminating it.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your output will consist of the solved puzzles, 16 lines of 16 characters each.

This will be immediately followed by the next puzzle, if any, with no blank lines separating them.

<P>Recently the ACM (Advanced Component Manufacturer) plans to develop a novel pizza maker machine named IPM (Iterating Pizza Maker). An IPM is composed of several components which are connected by tunnels. Tunnels are unidirectional. There are three kinds of tunnels, material tunnel (MT), intermediate tunnel (IT), and product tunnel (PT). Materials enter IPM from MTs and flow by the ``path" of IPM. A path is composed of several components and ITs connecting them. And as you can imagine, the ``release edition" of pizza comes out through PTs.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="892" HEIGHT="370" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/34/p3450a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3450a.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1 basic structure of an IPM</DIV><P>When materials pass through a component, they are transformed and sent to tunnels start from the component (if any). Using the structure above, we can make any kind of pizza we want!<P>For example, if we want to make a hexagonal pizza with pentagonal tomato pieces on it. It's a strange pizza, but we can do it with IPM. Now, we assemble an IPM like this:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="856" HEIGHT="348" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/34/p3450a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3450b.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 2 the IPM which makes strange pizzas</DIV><P>Here is the process of making ONE strange pizza mentioned above: One tomato goes into Component A through MT<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

<P>Steve owns an orchard where he plants some apple trees. In the harvest time there comes a thief who wishes to steal the delicious apples. The thief is very strong, so Steve cannot drive him away. But the thief does not want to hurt Steve, because he just wants the apples.<P>To minimize the number of apples the thief gets, what Steve can do is to pick the apples before the thief steals them or prevent the thief from stealing the apples. It is supposed that Steve and the thief are both highly intelligent. Your job is to calculate how many apples the thief can get.<P>The orchard is modeled by a two-player board game on a 5 by 6 square board. There are three kinds of squares: floor square, apple-tree square and wall square. The orchard has four apple-tree squares, each of which contains one apple tree with exactly three apples. Steve and the thief can locate on either floor square or apple-tree square. But they cannot locate on a square which is already occupied by the other.<P>The simulation begins with a move by the thief, followed with a move by Steve.

Dimensionality reduction is mapping a multidimensional space into a space of fewer dimensions. It is sometimes the case that analysis such as regression or classification can be carried out in the reduced space more accurately than in the original space. 

<P>
The general principle of dimensionality reduction is finding the dimensions that capture the most variance. 

<P>
In this problem, let's consider a simple scenario: mapping 3-dimensional to one dimension. Given <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>

It is known that when we do something, the efficiency may vary from time to time. That's related with what we usually refer to as physical ``state". To be more specific, we could make use of biorhythms to describe it. Most physical properties are subject to biorhythmic cycles, which may be roughly categorized as physiological cycles and psychological cycles, such as mental cycles, manual cycles, etc. 

<P>
The theory of biorhythms is widely applied in practice. For instance, Osaka Transportation in Japan schedules time tables for its automobile drivers with the help of the theory, both avoiding many accidents and promoting work efficiency as well. In the field of sports, right here in China, there have also been efforts in applying biorhythms. Analysis in China's failure in the Women's Basketball Championship held in Hong Kong has revealed the fact that on the very day, seven team members of China were either at low tide or critical tide and only one out of the five main members was at high tide. The outstanding Russian composer Tchaikovsky also told people that all of his success attributed to that he did regular things in the regular period of time everyday, and that he kept a sound mental state. So, only did one gain full knowledge of his or her biorhythmic cycles, can he or she achieve something within limited time and energy. 

<P>
In this problem, cycles are discretized, being equally sliced into consecutive intervals and it can be assumed that the ``state" mentioned above keeps invariant in an interval and all of cycles shares the same interval length. The state, for simplicity, will be measured by non-negative integer values called ``state values". Suppose that there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> different cycles with length not exceeding 20 (the length of a cycle is the number of intervals constituting the cycle), how can we find the interval during which a maximum sum of state values may be acquired. It is now up to you to decide.

Ratish is a young man who always dreams of being a hero. One day his friend Luffy was caught by Pirate Arlong. Ratish set off at once to Arlong's island. When he got there, he found the secret place where his friend was kept, but he could not go straight in. He saw a large door in front of him and two locks in the door. Beside the large door, he found a strange rock, on which there were some odd words. The sentences were encrypted. But that was easy for Ratish, an amateur cryptographer. After decrypting all the sentences, Ratish knew the following facts: 

<P>
Behind the large door, there is a nesting prison, which consists of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> floors. Each floor except the deepest one has a door leading to the next floor, and there are two locks in each of these doors. Ratish can pass through a door if he opens either of the two locks in it. There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> different types of locks in all. The same type of locks may appear in different doors, and a door may have two locks of the same type. There is only one key that can unlock one type of lock, so there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> keys for all the <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> types of locks. These <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> keys were divided into <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> pairs, and once one key in a pair is used, the other key will disappear and never show up again. 

<P>
Later, Ratish found <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> pairs of keys under the rock and a piece of paper recording exactly what kinds of locks are in the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> doors. But Ratish doesn't know which floor Luffy is held, so he has to open as many doors as possible. Can you help him to choose <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> keys to open the maximum number of doors?

<P>Mike is the owner of a cheese factory.

To keep his cheese free from viruses, he made himself a purifying machine to clean virus-infected cheese. As a talented programmer, his purifying machine is built in a special way. His purifying machine has <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> switches, each switch has three states, <TT>1</TT>, <TT>0</TT> and <TT>*</TT>. An operation of this machine is a cleaning action according to the states of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> switches. During one operation, at most one switch can be turned to state <TT>*</TT>, which can substitute for either <TT>1</TT> or <TT>0</TT>.

For example, if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> equals 6 and the switches are turned to <TT>01*100</TT>, the cheeses numbered <TT>010100</TT> and <TT>011100</TT> are under operation by the machine.<P>One day, Mike's machine was infected.

Once upon a time, there was a young man who loved adventure. He found an old lambskin in his grandfather's relic which described a secret buried treasure. The old lambskin told him to go to a particular deserted island. There was a big stretch of lawn on the north shore of the island. On the lawn there was an oak tree, a pine tree and a gallows. The instructions were as following: Walk from the gallows to the oak tree and remember the distance, turn right and walk the same distance, and make a mark there. Then return to the gallows, walk towards the pine tree and remember the distance, turn left and walk the same distance, and also make a mark. Excavate at the middle point of the segment between the two marks, and the treasure will be there (see Figure 1).

<P>
The young man found that island and also found the oak tree and the pine tree, but the gallows was destroyed due to the abrasion of time. The young person was disappointed and went back. What a pity! If the young man had some geometry knowledge, he would discover that the position of the treasure is independent from the position of the gallows. But I believe you will not make similar mistakes. Given a general description of how to find the treasure, your job is to find the position of the treasure, if the position can be fixed. First you will be given some points of original marks. The positions of some of these points are known, but the others are unknown. Then you will be given some instructions to make new marks. There are three kinds of instructions: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.</DT>
<DD>Given two marks A and B, the new mark is at the middle point between A and B.

<DT>3.</DT>
<DD>Given two marks A and B, walk from A to B, turn right, walk the same distance as the distance between A and B, and then make a mark.

<P>John's college will hold a programming contest, and now it's calling for problems. John wants to contribute a problem to this contest. After finishing the problem, he found some trouble in verifying the programmer's output. For most programming problems, you can just compare the programmer's output against the correct answer, and if they are literally the same, the programmer's output is correct, otherwise it's wrong. But for this problem, there may be many correct answers and they can be different from each other literally. So John must write a program to verify programmers' output (We can call this program ``Special Judge"). Soon, he found the Special Judge is too difficult for him, so he turns to you for help.<P><P><BR>Here is the description of John's original problem:<P><hr><P><P><BR><BIG CLASS="XLARGE"><B>Original Problem</B></BIG><P><P><P><BR>/* Adapted from ``Help the problem setter", Ulm Local 2005 */<P><P><P><BR>Let us define a <SPAN CLASS="textbf">binary search tree</SPAN> inductively as follows:<P><UL><LI>The empty tree which has no node is a binary search tree; </LI><LI>Each non-empty binary search tree has a root, which is a node labeled with an integer, and two binary search trees as left and right subtrees of the root; </LI><LI>The labels of the nodes in the left subtree are all less than the label of the root; </LI><LI>The labels of the nodes in the right subtree are all greater than the label of the root. </LI></UL><P>Given such a binary search tree, the following search procedure can be used to locate a node in the tree: Start with the root node.

David the Great has just become the king of a desert country. To win the respect of his people, he decided to build channels all over his country to bring water to every village. Villages which are connected to his capital village will be watered. As the dominate ruler and the symbol of wisdom in the country, he needs to build the channels in a most elegant way. 

<P>
After days of study, he finally figured his plan out. He wanted the average cost of each mile of the channels to be minimized. In other words, the ratio of the overall cost of the channels to the total length must be minimized. He just needs to build the necessary channels to bring water to all the villages, which means there will be only one way to connect each village to the capital. 

<P>
His engineers surveyed the country and recorded the position and altitude of each village. All the channels must go straight between two villages and be built horizontally. Since every two villages are at different altitudes, they concluded that each channel between two villages needed a vertical water lifter, which can lift water up or let water flow down. The length of the channel is the horizontal distance between the two villages. The cost of the channel is the height of the lifter. You should notice that each village is at a different altitude, and different channels can't share a lifter. Channels can intersect safely and no three villages are on the same line. 

<P>
As King David's prime scientist and programmer, you are asked to find out the best solution to build the channels.

Robocode is an educational game designed to help learn Java. The players write programs that control tanks fighting with each other on a battlefield. The idea of this game may seem simple, but it takes a lot of effort to write a winning tank's program. Today we are not going to write an intelligent tank, but to design a simplified robocode game engine.

They have a constant speed of 10 pixels/second when they move and they can't move out of the boundary (they will stop moving, staying in the direction that they are currently facing, when touching any boundary of the battlefield). The tank can shoot in the direction it's facing whether it's moving or still. The shot moves at the constant speed 20 pixel/second and the size of the shot is also negligible. It will explode when it meets a tank on the path. It's possible for more than one shot to explode in the same place if they all reach a tank at the exact same time. The tank being hit by the explosion will be destroyed and will be removed from the battlefield at once. A shot exploding or flying out of the boundary will also be removed.

If two straight raceways connect to a turn, we call the turn a simple turn, and the speed of an F1 race car entering and leaving a simple turn should not exceed 45 m/s.

Is this crazy weather the result of mankind's continuous interference in the environment? Or is it simply the normal cycle of climate changes through the ages? No one seems to know for sure, but the fact is that natural phenomena such as tornadoes and hurricanes have been hitting our country with more force and frequence than in past decades. 

<P>
One tornado has just hit Silverado Farm, a cattle and milk producer, and made havoc. The barn roof was torn, several trees were uprooted, the farm truck was overturned... But the worst thing is that the tornado destroyed several sections of the fence that surrounded the property. The fence was very well built, with concrete posts every two meters, and barbed wire enclosing the whole farm perimeter (the perimeter, in meters, is an even number, making the fence perfectly regular). 

<P>
Now several posts are broken or missing, and there are gaps in the fence. To prevent the cattle from getting out of the property, the fence must be restored as quickly as possible. Reconstructing the fence to its original form, with concrete posts, will take a long time. In the meantime, the farm owners decided to close the gaps with a temporary fence, made with wooden posts. Wooden posts will be placed in exactly the same spots where missing/broken concrete posts were/are. However, in order to make the temporary reconstruction faster and less expensive, the owners decided to use fewer posts: a wooden post will be used to replace a missing/broken concrete post only if the length of the barbed wired needed to close the distance to the next post (wooden or concrete) exceeds four meters.

You have been hired to explore enemy territory. It is risky business, you know that. So, you'd better be prepared! The enemy has placed a number of security points all over his country, from which radars are detecting any moving vehicle within their range of cover. Any such detected ob ject will be immediately destroyed. Fortunately enough, you have been given by your government a map of the enemy territory, consisting of coordinates and radius of coverage of each radar. You have also a list of local informers (together with their locations) that you should contact in order to obtain valuable information. Your mission is to try to contact one of these informers, preferably the one with highest <SPAN  CLASS="textit">insider-coefficient</SPAN>. The insider-coefficient of each informer is simply the distance from the informer to the border of the country, where such a distance is defined as the minimum over all distances from the location of the informer to each point of the border. In intuitive sense, the informer with highest insider-coefficient is that who is located as inside the country as possible, and will presumably have more valuable information about the country. 

<P>
Your first thought is then to design a computer program which will check if there is a path from your initial location, always the point (2000, 2000), to any of the informers' location, without crossing any region which is covered by radar. Whenever possible, the program should indicate which reachable informer is the one to be contacted, according to the insider-coefficient criteria described above.

The enemy country has the shape of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">simple polygon</SPAN> (<SPAN  CLASS="textit">not necessarily convex</SPAN>). Recall that a polygon is called simple if it is described by a single, non-intersecting boundary.

<P>Pascal University, one of the oldest in the country, needs to renovate its Library Building, because after all these centuries the building started to show the effects of supporting the weight of the enormous amount of books it houses.<P>To help in the renovation, the Alumni Association of the University decided to organize a series of fund-raising dinners, for which all alumni were invited. These events proved to be a huge success and several were organized during the past year. (One of the reasons for the success of this initiative seems to be the fact that students that went through the Pascal system of education have fond memories of that time and would love to see a renovated Pascal Library.)<P>The organizers maintained a spreadsheet indicating which alumni participated in each dinner.

<P>International Concrete Projects Company (ICPC) is a construction company which specializes in building houses for the high-end market. The company is the most profitable company in the world due to a very efficient land division method which has been used in its housing development pro jects since last year. Recently there was a chaos at ICPC, because employees refused to work arguing that they did not earn enough. Worried about the loss in profit due to the strike, the company board proposed a new method to calculate the salaries which was luckily accepted by everyone.<P>The salary of a worker reflects the significance of the tasks that he/she has to perform and is influenced by the way tasks depend on each other.<P>A task <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> <SPAN CLASS="textit">depends</SPAN> on a task <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> if either (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> <SPAN CLASS="textit">depends directly</SPAN> on <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> , or (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ii</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) there exists a task <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> such that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> depends directly on <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> depends on <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> .

Also, a task may be performed by more than one worker.<P>A <SPAN CLASS="textit">basic significance</SPAN> is associated with each task reflecting its importance (for example, developing the efficient land division method is more important than building the houses themselves).

<P>A far away developing country is trying to improve its communication infrastructure. Currently, each city in the country has its local computer network, but there is no fast communication between the cities. The Autonomous Communications Ministry (ACM) of the country decided to create a fast, optical fiber network connecting every city. In order to do this, they decided to take the following approach. Pairs of cities were chosen to have an optical fiber link installed between them. The choice was such that there will be only one fiber path between any pair of cities, in order to reduce the cost. The pairs of cities were chosen considering many factors, including analysis of estimated demand and distance between the cities.<P>Each city will have one optical router installed, which will be used to connect all the optical links with one end in that city. In each city, there are many different locations where the optical router can be installed. Your task, as an engineer working on this pro ject, is to develop a computer program to pick up the locations in each city in order to minimize the total length of fiber that will be necessary for this pro ject.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of multiple test cases.

<P>
One way that scientists try to measure how one species evolved into another is to find out how the ancestor's genome changed into the other's. Closely related species have several genes in common and it turns out that a good way to compare them is comparing how the common genes changed place. 

<P>
One of the most common mutations that change the order of a genomes' genes is the reversal. If we model a genome as a sequence of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> genes with each gene being an integer from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> , then a reversal is a mutation that changes the genome by reverting the order of a block of consecutive genes. A reversal can be described by two indexes <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>i</I>, <I>j</I>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <!-- MATH
 $1 \le i \le j \le N$

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. So, when it is applied to a genome <!-- MATH

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, we obtain the genome <!-- MATH
 $[g_{1} , \cdots , g_{i-1} , g_{j} , g_{j-1} , \cdots , g_{i+1} , g_{i} , g_{j+1} , \cdots , g_{N}]$

<SPAN CLASS="MATH">[<I>g</I><SUB>1</SUB>,<SUP> ... </SUP>, <I>g</I><SUB>i-1</SUB>, <I>g</I><SUB>j</SUB>, <I>g</I><SUB>j-1</SUB>,<SUP> ... </SUP>, <I>g</I><SUB>i+1</SUB>, <I>g</I><SUB>i</SUB>, <I>g</I><SUB>j+1</SUB>,<SUP> ... </SUP>, <I>g</I><SUB>N</SUB>]</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. As an example, the reversal (3, 6) applied to the genome [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] gives [1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3, 7]. If after that the reversal (1, 3) is applied, we obtain the genome [6, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 7]. 

<P>
A scientist studying the evolution of a species wants to try a series of reversals on its genome. Then he wants to query the final position of several genes. Would you take the challenge and help him?

<P>A very famous DJ has been recently invited to play in the closing party of a Computer Science conference. Trying to impress the participants of the event, he decided to use a program in order to choose the songs he would play at this party. However, the result was a disaster, since the way the program chose the songs was quite weird and repetitive.<P>First of all, the DJ has selected <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> songs among the set of songs he had available. The program used by the DJ then labels each of the songs using one different character from `A' to `Z'. The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th song is labeled using the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th character of the sequence `A'-`Z'. The program chooses the songs to be played in the party in the order that their labels appear in the following infinite sequence of characters: first come all the words with one character in lexicographical order; then all the words with two characters in lexicographical order; then all the words with three characters in lexicographical order; and so on. For <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = 3</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, this sequence would be ABCAAABACBABBBCCACBCCAAAAABAACABAABBABC...<P>At the end of the party, some people asked the DJ if he remembered which the first song played was. Others would like to know which the 25-th was, and so on. The DJ remembers nothing but the strange pattern of repetition of the songs, so he urges you to help him and write a program which answers such queries.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several test cases.

<P>Recently the auction house has introduced a new type of auction, the lowest price auction. In this new system, people compete for the lowest bid price, as opposed to what they did in the past. What an amazing thing! Now you could buy cool stuff with one penny. Your task is to write the software to automate this auction system.<P>First the auctioneer puts an upper limit on bid price for each item. Only positive price less than or equal to this price limit is a valid bid. For example, if the price limit is 100, then 1 to 100, inclusive, are all valid bid prices. Bidder can not put more than one bid for the same price on a same item. However they can put many bids on a same item, as long as the prices are different. After all bids are set, the auctioneer chooses the winner according to the following rules:<P><OL><LI>If any valid price comes from only one bidder, the price is a "unique bid". If there are unique bids, then the unique bid with the lowest price wins. This price is the winning price and the only bidder is the winning bidder. </LI><LI>If there are no unique bids, then the price with fewest bids is the winning bid. If there are more than one price which has the same lowest bid count, choose the lowest one. This price is the winning price. The bidder who puts this bid first is the winning bidder. </LI></OL><P>Given the price limit and all the bids that happen in order, you will determine the winning bidder and the winning price.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Standard input will contain multiple test cases.

<P>Scientists are conducting research on the behavior of a newly discovered Agamic Cellular Microbe. This special kind of microbe is capable of massively reproducing by itself in a short time. The lifetime of an ACM consists of three phases:<P><OL><LI>The infancy phase, which starts from its birth and lasts for approximately several seconds; </LI><LI>The multiplication phase, in which one ACM can procreate up to 100 offspring in only several milliseconds; </LI><LI>The mature phase, in which it remains inactive for the rest of its life. </LI></OL><P>At the beginning of the experiment, a newborn, single cell of ACM, is put into a suitable circumstance for its production. This cell, numbered as 0, starts to multiply and its descendants are numbered, starting from 1, according to their positions in the family hierarchy.

<P>The mobile network market in country XYZ used to be dominated by two large corporations, XYZ Telecom and XYZ Mobile. The central government recently has realized that radio frequency spectrum is a scarce resource and wants to regulate its usage. The spectrum currently in use is divided into 300,000 channels. Any wireless service provider who wishes to use certain spectrum should apply for licenses on these channels. While some services may require use of multiple channels, a single channel can not be shared by different services.<P>The central government wants to maximize its revenue from the spectrum by putting the channels up to an auction. The only two bidders are XYZ Telecom and XYZ Mobile. They are allowed to place bids on combinations of channels, through which their services can communicate with the customers. Furthermore, the government stipulates that a company can only place at most one bid on a specific channel.<P>The government can only accept a subset of the bids so none of them would conflict with each other. However, officials soon find out that it is a difficult task to determine the winning bids in order to maximize the revenue, and they are asking for your help.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Standard input will contain multiple test cases.

<P>It is said that Columbus once invented card games. After thousands of years, all kinds of card games have spread all over the world. Shuffling the deck is an inevitable task, because no one wants to play the same game twice. There are usually 54 cards in a deck, and we usually shuffle the deck by repeatedly taking out a sequence of cards and put them onto the top of the deck. The following figure illustrates the effect of a single shuffle.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="649" HEIGHT="205" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/34/p3488.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3488.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">A single shuffle with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I> = 2</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I> = 3</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> will move the white cards onto the top</DIV><P>To help people shuffle, Edison invented a machine, namely Automated Card-shuffling Machine.

Of course the instructions are generated by a randomizer. Unfortunately it is discovered that the randomizer has a bug that leads to repetitive instructions. That is, several consecutive instructions may be exactly the same.

<P>Modern applications are usually built upon a certain framework to handle a group of common tasks. Java web applications can utilize the Apache Struts framework to implement the controller logic. The controller receives user requests and dispatches them to appropriate actions. Once the action finishes handling the request it can choose to forward the request to either another action for further handling or to a server page to render the user interface.<P>For instance if the user hits the path ``/submitOrder" with the necessary information, the controller will first locate the action configured to serve that path and forward the request to it. The action will determine the validity of the request, and choose within one of the three forwards ``success", ``failure" or ``login". These forwards may map to different paths, for instance, ``success" to ``/processCreditCard", which is handled by another action to initiate the credit card transaction, and ``login" to ``/login.jsp" to require the user to log into the website before submitting the order.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="519" HEIGHT="213" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/34/p3489.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3489.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>Due to the time constraint of the contest, we are not planning to cope with any serious business logic. Instead we have created a random action that will send the request to one of configured forwards with equal probability. The request will be rendered once it reaches a server page. Given a set of action configuration and a request path, we need to know which server page we are most likely to reach.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Standard input will contain multiple test cases.

Mark I is the first generation robot designed by the corporation for mine exploration. The area to explore is always partitioned into grids. Each grid may or may not have mine underground. The robot's task is to explore the mines in the area.

<P>
The robot can perform actions according to the following four instructions:

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<PRE><TT>
<TT>Forward</TT>		 The robot will move forward by one grid; 
<BR><TT>Turn Left</TT> 		 The robot will turn to its left; 
<BR><TT>Turn Right</TT> 		 The robot will turn to its right; 
<BR><TT>Scan</TT> 		 The robot will scan the grid in front of itself.
</TT></PRE> 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Mark I is so popular that it brings considerable profit to the corporation. However some other companies begin to devise similar products. In order to defeat those opponents, Mark II comes to the world. Since many customers complain about the complexity of the former product, Mark II no long uses the old instructions. Instead it supports only 2 instructions - Move and Scan.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Move instruction is in the following form:

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<TT>Move <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>DIR</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark></TT>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>DIR</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> can be either ``<TT>Forward</TT>", ``<TT>Back</TT>", ``<TT>Left</TT>" or ``<TT>Right</TT>". <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is a positive number. It will make the robot move forward by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> grids. If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>DIR</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is not ``<TT>Forward</TT>", the robot will turn to the specified direction before making the movements.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Scan command is in the following form:

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<TT>Scan <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>DIR</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark></TT>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>DIR</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> can be either ``<TT>Forward</TT>", ``<TT>Back</TT>", ``<TT>Left</TT>" or ``<TT>Right</TT>". It will make the robot scan the grid in front of itself. If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>DIR</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is not ``<TT>Forward</TT>", the robot will turn to the specified direction before performing the scans.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
In order to persuade those original customers with Mark I to upgrade their products, the corporation plans to install a new chip into Mark II, which can translate the old instruction scripts into the equivalent new version.

<P>Adding binary numbers is a very simple task, and very similar to the longhand addition of decimal numbers. As with decimal numbers, you start by adding the bits (digits) one column at a time, from right to left. Unlike decimal addition, there is little to memorize in the way of rules for the addition of binary bits:<P><PRE>
   0 + 0 = 0 
   1 + 0 = 1 
   0 + 1 = 1 
   1 + 1 = 10 
   1 + 1 + 1 = 11
</PRE><P>Just as with decimal addition, when the sum in one column is a two-bit (two-digit) number, the least significant figure is written as part of the total sum and the most significant figure is ``carried" to the next left column. Consider the following examples:<P><PRE>
                       11  1 &lt;-- Carry bits --&gt; 1   11 
  1001101             1001001                    1000111 
+ 0010010           + 0011001                  + 1010110 
 --------           ---------                  ---------
  1011111             1100010                   10011101
</PRE><P>The addition problem on the left did not require any bits to be carried, since the sum of bits in each column was either 1 or 0, not 10 or 11. In the other two problems, there definitely were bits to be carried, but the process of addition is still quite simple.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The first line of input contains an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(1<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/34/3493img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>N</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/34/3493img1.png ALT="$ \le$">1000)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, which is the number of binary addition problems that follow.

<P>Customers of the <SPAN CLASS="textit">Bank of Kalii</SPAN> handle their banking transactions similar to the way they handle their taxes: be as terse as possible. As a result, when a customer writes a check or fills out a deposit or withdrawal form, they leave off the year on any date they write down. So, instead of writing: 09/20/2005, they would write: 9/20 and be done with it. In general, the year can be inferred since it will be relatively close to the date the transaction is actually processed by the bank.<P>Without going into the intricate details of how the <SPAN CLASS="textit">Bank of Kalii</SPAN> calculates interest and banking fees (that is a problem for another time...), suffice to say the bank must determine the actual date the customer wrote on the check or form, and calculate the number of days prior (or in the future) the document is dated. You see, <SPAN CLASS="textit">Kaliian</SPAN> bankers, like their government officials, are overworked, so they may not get around to processing transactions for up to a week. The customers know this, so they often date their checks and forms a several days in the future - this complicates the bankers' duties as well.<P><P><BR>Your job is to write a program to compare a date written on a check or form with the date the transaction is being processed, and, determine the full date the customer meant as well as how many days prior (or in the future) the document is dated.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The first line of input contains an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> which is the number of datasets that follow <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(1<IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/34/3494img1.png ALT="$ \le$"><I>N</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/34/3494img1.png ALT="$ \le$">1000)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

<P>brainf*ck is the ungodly creation of Urban Mller, whose goal was apparently to create a Turing-complete language for which he could write the smallest compiler ever. <SPAN ID="txt48">http://en.wikipedia.org</SPAN> defines it as ``a computer programming language designed to challenge and amuse programmers, and is not suitable for practical use.

The recent Texas Hold'em craze has spawned a bunch of on-line Poker sites. These sites tend to breed a group of poor players whose primary strategy is to never fold or throw away a hand. These players will always play and bet on every card on every hand  no matter what the cost or what cards they have. You have decided to take advantage of these stupid players by developing your own poker site that allows you to always beat these players. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The way your site will work is: there are only two players in each game: you and your opponent (this is called a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">heads-up</SPAN> game). Each of the two players will get two ``hole cards"; these cards are dealt face down so, presumably, only the player can see them. Four of the five community cards (cards shared by both players) will be dealt face up on the table. We will dispense with any betting for the purpose of this problem: it is irrelevant since each player will always call every bet right to the ``river" (the fifth and final community card). You will always be seated at position 1, and your opponent at position 2. The program knows what seat you are sitting at and the hole cards for both players, therefore, it can compute all the cards that remain in the deck that will <SPAN  CLASS="textit">maximize</SPAN> the amount of money you would get playing the hand folding is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> an option. In the event there is no card that would allow you to win or tie the hand, you will be forced to take a loss on that hand (after all, it looks good if you lose <SPAN  CLASS="textit">sometimes</SPAN>).

For each data set, your program will output (on a new line) the data set number followed by a colon, followed by a space, and a list of card(s) that will <SPAN  CLASS="textit">maximize</SPAN> the amount of money you could get playing the hand. If no card will allow you to win or tie, just display `<TT>LOSER</TT>' instead of the cards. Each card should be separated by a single space. Your program will display up to 15 cards on each output line. If more than one output line is required for a dataset, additional lines should be indented by exactly 3 spaces. Cards should be output in suit order (S,D,H,C) and rank order within each suit (Ace high).

<P>One method used to determine the height achieved by a model rocket is the <SPAN CLASS="textit">geodesic</SPAN> method. Two observers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> are spaced 100 feet apart along a base line along one edge of the flat test field. The launch platform is equidistant from observers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and 50 feet from the base line. Each observer has a theodolite or some other device for measuring angle above the horizontal (elevation angle) of a distant object and the azimuth angle (the angle the vertical plane of the sight line makes with the line from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> through <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> measured counter-clockwise). Each measuring device is on a stand. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>'s device is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>HA</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> feet above the launch platform and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>'s device is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>HB</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> feet above the launch platform. When a rocket is fired, near the top of its flight, it deploys a parachute and emits a puff of smoke. Each observer measures the elevation angle and azimuth angle of the puff of smoke from their location. If the peak location is on the wrong side of the baseline or outside the lines determined by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> perpendicular to the base line, it is out of bounds and disqualified. From this information, the height of the rocket may be determined as follows:<P>On each sight line, find the point on that sight line closest to the other sight line.

<P>One of the reasons for which &#201;cole polytechnique (nicknamed ``X" for reasons to be explained during the debriefing talk) is so deeply rooted in French society is its famous network of <SPAN CLASS="textit">camarades</SPAN> - former students of the same school. When one camarade wants something (money, job, etc.), he can ask this network for help and support. In practice, this means that when he/she wants to reach some other camarade, not always of the same year, then surely he can find intermediate camarades to get to her/him. Note that the ``camarade" relationship is symmetric. Due to the magic of the X network, there is always a means to reach anybody.<P>The program you have to write is supposed to help to minimize the number of these intermediate camarades.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><B>The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.

<P>In the laundry next to my flat, clothes are stored on coat hangers that are put on hooks fixed on a circular rail moved electrically by a computer. Hooks are numbered so that finding a cloth is easy.

The computer then looks for the first location of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> + 2</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> free hooks, from the current position of the rail to the right, yielding zone <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I>..<I>k</I> + <I>n</I> + 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> (all indices considered modulo <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> ). Once this is done, the rail moves so that hook numbered <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> + <I>n</I> + 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> arrives on the mark, and the launderer puts the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> clothes on the hooks <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> + 1..<I>k</I> + <I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

World Wide Networks (WWN) is a leading company that operates large telecommunication networks. WWN would like to setup a new network in Borduria, a nice country that recently managed to get rid of its military dictator Kurvi-Tasch and which is now seeking for investments of international companies (for a complete description of Borduria, have a look to the following Tintin albums ``King Ottokar's Sceptre", ``The Calculus Affair" and ``Tintin and the Picaros").

The bottom network in Figure 1 corresponds to the solution in which the first and the third networks have been bought. Thin edges correspond to edges build from scratch while thick edges are those from one of the initial networks.

<P>Simon and Garfunkel Corporation (SG Corp.) is a large steel-making company with thousand of customers. Keeping the customer satisfied is one of the major objective of Paul and Art, the managers.<P>Customers issue orders that are characterized by two integer values <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the amount of steel required (in tons) and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the due date (a calender date converted in seconds). The due date has to be met if SG Corp. accepts the order. Stated another way, when an order is accepted, the corresponding amount of steel has to be produced before its due date. Of course, the factory can process no more than one order at a time.<P>Although the manufacturing process is rather complex, it can be seen as a single production line with a constant throughput. In the following, <SPAN CLASS="textit">we assume that producing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> tons of steel takes exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> seconds</SPAN> (i.e., throughput is 1).

Everywhere I go,

I hear words I never heard 
In the bible 
And I'm on step ahead of the shoe shine 
Two steps away from the county line 
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied,

Bob and Alice live in Roswell (New Mexico, USA) and they have found some strange item on the floor left by an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO). Let us recall that on July 8, 1947, as stated by Col. William Blanchard, Commander of the 509th Bomb Group at Roswell, ``the wreckage of a crashed disk has been recovered". We believe that this strange item comes from this crash. It looks like a big cube of size <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>

Bob and Alice analyze the cube by putting a light sensor in front of each face of the cube.

<P>
Michael and Nick are living near the famous top-secret ``Area 51" facility. The facility is enclosed by a fence and is so large that for the purpose of this problem we consider the fence being a line that stretches infinitely into both directions. 

<P>
Only extremely brave boys are not scared to go to the fence and peek at the facility. Nick is among the brave ones. He once came to the fence and saw a number of chimneys with distinct shapes. As a proof of his bravery he tells everybody what chimneys he saw from his left to his right. 

<P>
Michael's father is working at ``Area 51" and has a facility's map at his home. Michael found this map and he can now verify Nick's claim of being near the facility's fence. However, it turns out to be complicated, and your task is to write a program to perform this verification. 

<P>
On a map distinctly shaped chimneys are denoted by capital letters from A to Z. Each letter denotes a distinct shape, but chimneys with this shape can appear more than once on a map. The map uses Cartesian coordinate system oriented so that the fence is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Ox</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> axis and all chimneys are located on a half-plane with a positive <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> coordinate. All chimneys are considered to be points (their sizes and actual geometrical shapes are ignored for the purpose of this problem).

<P>
Nick claims that he looked from a point on the fence where no two chimneys were on the same line of his sight (a line that originates from his point of view). It means that at the point he looked from, all the chimneys he saw had a well-defined order from left to right. 

<P>
Michael have already made a preliminary verification of Nick's claim. He made sure that the number of distinctly shaped chimneys matches their number on the map. Now Michael needs to perform a final verification - to get a list of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> coordinates on a fence (if any) where the corresponding arrangement of chimneys could be seen from. This information shall be presented as an ordered list of open intervals <!-- MATH

<P>Let us consider arithmetic expressions that consist of variables denoted by lower-case letters ``a" to ``z"; four <SPAN CLASS="textit">binary</SPAN> arithmetic operations: addition (``<TT>+</TT>"), subtraction (``<TT>-</TT>"), multiplication (``<TT>*</TT>"), and division (``<TT>/</TT>"); opening (``<TT>(</TT>") and closing (``<TT>)</TT>") round brackets. The normal order of precedence is used - multiplication and division have the highest precedence, addition and subtraction have the lowest precedence. Operations of the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (for example <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I> - <I>b</I> + <I>c</I> = (<I>a</I> - <I>b</I>) + <I>c</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>).<P>Thus, the grammar for the expressions is the following:<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=3><COL ALIGN=RIGHT><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COL ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=RIGHT NOWRAP><!-- MATH

<P>
Double Patience is a single player game played with a standard 36-card deck. The cards are shuffled and laid down on a table in 9 piles of 4 cards each, faces up. 

<P>
After the cards are laid down, the player makes turns. In a turn he can take top cards of the same rank from any two piles and remove them. If there are several possibilities, the player can choose any one. If all the cards are removed from the table, the player wins the game, if some cards are still on the table and there are no valid moves, the player loses. 

<P>
George enjoys playing this patience. But when there are several possibilities to remove two cards, he doesn't know which one to choose. George doesn't want to think much, so in such case he just chooses a random pair from among the possible variants and removes it. George chooses among all possible pairs with equal probability. 

<P>
For example, if the top cards are KS, KH, KD, 9H, 8S, 8D, 7C, 7D, and 6H, he removes any particular pair of (KS, KH), (KS, KD), (KH, KD), (8S, 8D), and (7C, 7D) with the equal probability of 1/5. 

<P>
Once George's friend Andrew came to see him and noticed that he sometimes doesn't act optimally. George argued, that it is not important - the probability of winning any given patience with his strategy is large enough. 

<P>
Help George to prove his statement - given the cards on the table in the beginning of the game, find out what is the probability of George winning the game if he acts as described.

</H2>

<P>
The input file contains several test cases, each of them consists of nine lines. Each line contains the description of four cards that form a pile in the beginning of the game, from the bottom card to the top one. 

<P>
Each card is described with two characters: one for rank, one for suit. Ranks are denoted as `<TT>6</TT>' for six, `<TT>7</TT>' for seven, `<TT>8</TT>' for eight, `<TT>9</TT>' for nine, `<TT>T</TT>' for ten, `<TT>J</TT>' for jack, `<TT>Q</TT>' for queen, `<TT>K</TT>' for king, and `<TT>A</TT>' for ace. Suits are denoted as `<TT>S</TT>' for spades, `<TT>C</TT>' for clubs, `<TT>D</TT>' for diamonds, and `<TT>H</TT>' for hearts. For example, ``<TT>KS</TT>" denotes the king of spades. 

<P>
Card descriptions are separated from each other by one space.

<P>Archaeologists have discovered a new set of hidden caves in one of the Egyptian pyramids. The decryption of ancient hieroglyphs on the walls nearby showed that the caves structure is as follows. There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> caves in a pyramid, connected by narrow passages, one of the caves is connected by a passage to the outer world. The system of the passages is organized in such a way, that there is exactly one way to get from outside to each cave along passages. All caves are located in the basement of the pyramid, so we can consider them being located in the same plane. Passages do not intersect. Each cave has its walls colored in one of several various colors.<P>The scientists have decided to create a more detailed description of the caves, so they decided to use an exploring robot. The robot they are planning to use has two types of memory - the output tape, which is used for writing down the description of the caves, and the operating memory organized as a stack.<P>The robot first enters the cave connected to the outer world along the passage. When it travels along any passage for the first time, it puts its description on the top of its stack. When the robot enters any cave, it prints the color of its walls to its output tape. After that it chooses the leftmost passage among those that it has not yet travelled and goes along it. If there is no such passage, the robot takes the passage description from the top of its stack and travels along it in the reverse direction. The robot's task is over when it returns to the outside of the pyramid.

Bill calls this value the <SPAN CLASS="textit">emotional value</SPAN> of the day. The greater the emotional value is, the better the day was.

<P>John owns a furniture workshop. His clients are very rich people, so they often order furniture suites made of precious sorts of hardwood.<P>Recently John has got a series of orders from his clients, so now he needs to cut a hardwood board to several pieces. The board has a rectangular form of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> feet. John has marked the outlines of the pieces to cut out on the board, and is planning to use his circular saw to cut it.<P>However, there is a little problem. Due to the construction of the circular saw, it is only possible to make straight cuts starting at the edge of the board. Although, after cutting away a part of the board John can take it away and make a cut from the new part of the edge, some pieces still cannot be separated using a circular saw. For example, pieces `C' and `D' on the picture below cannot be separated, neither can `E' and `Z'. To deal with such situations John will need to use his fret-saw to finish the cutting.<P>Now John wonders what is the maximal number of parts he can cut the board to with his circular saw, so that he needs less work to do with his fret-saw.

<P>
Alex is administrator of IP networks. His clients have a bunch of individual IP addresses and he decided to group all those IP addresses into the smallest possible IP network. 

<P>
Each IP address is a 4-byte number that is written byte-by-byte in a decimal dot-separated notation ``byte0.byte1.byte2.byte3" (quotes are added for clarity). Each byte is written as a decimal number from 0 to 255 (inclusive) without extra leading zeroes. 

<P>
IP network is described by two 4-byte numbers - network address and network mask. Both network address and network mask are written in the same notation as IP addresses. 

<P>
In order to understand the meaning of network address and network mask you have to consider their binary representation. Binary representation of IP address, network address, and network mask consists of 32 bits: 8 bits for byte0 (most significant to least significant), followed by 8 bits for byte1, followed by 8 bits for byte2, and followed by 8 bits for byte3. 

<P>
IP network contains a range of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<SUP>n</SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> IP addresses where <!-- MATH

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> first bits set to one, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> last bits set to zero in its binary representation. Network address has arbitrary <SPAN CLASS="MATH">32 - <I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> first bits, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> last bits set to zero in its binary representation. IP network contains all IP addresses whose <SPAN CLASS="MATH">32 - <I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> first bits are equal to <SPAN CLASS="MATH">32 - <I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> first bits of network address with arbitrary <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> last bits. We say that one IP network is smaller than the other IP network if it contains fewer IP addresses. 

<P>
For example, IP network with network address 194.85.160.176 and network mask 255.255.255.248 contains 8 IP addresses from 194.85.160.176 to 194.85.160.183 (inclusive).

The Evil Empire is devising a plan to destroy the world. This plan is called ``Operation Knockdown". The plan is to place a number of high-yield nuclear bombs in different places around the world, so that their simultaneous detonation will destroy everything on the planet. For the purpose of planning this operation, bombs have <SPAN  CLASS="textit">destruction distance</SPAN> - the distance from the point of bomb's detonation to all the places where everything is considered destroyed. 

<P>
Places for the bombs have been already selected. Now the Evil Empire wants to minimize the cost of production for the bombs. It is expensive to design atomic bombs tailored for different destruction distances, so the idea is to design a bomb with a specific destruction distance and to produce bombs according to this design for all the selected places. The problem is to find the minimal required destruction distance for the bomb design, so that destruction of the whole world is ensured.

<P>Being a knight is a very attractive career: searching for the Holy Grail, saving damsels in distress, and drinking with the other knights are fun things to do. Therefore, it is not very surprising that in recent years the kingdom of King Arthur has experienced an unprecedented increase in the number of knights. There are so many knights now, that it is very rare that every Knight of the Round Table can come at the same time to Camelot and sit around the round table; usually only a small group of the knights isthere, while the rest are busy doing heroic deeds around the country.<P>Knights can easily get over-excited during discussions-especially after a couple of drinks. After some unfortunate accidents, King Arthur asked the famous wizard Merlin to make sure that in the future no fights break out between the knights. After studying the problem carefully, Merlin realized that the fights can only be prevented if the knights are seated according to the following two rules:<P><UL><LI>The knights should be seated such that two knights who hate each other should not be neighbors at the table. (Merlin has a list that says who hates whom.) The knights are sitting around a roundtable, thus every knight has exactly two neighbors. </LI><LI>An odd number of knights should sit around the table. This ensures that if the knights cannot agree on something, then they can settle the issue by voting. (If the number of knights is even, then itcan happen that ``yes" and ``no" have the same number of votes, and the argument goes on.) </LI></UL><P>Merlin will let the knights sit down only if these two rules are satisfied, otherwise he cancels the meeting. (If only one knight shows up, then the meeting is canceled as well, as one person cannot sit around a table.) Merlin realized that this means that there can be knights who cannot be part of any seating arrangements that respect these rules, and these knights will never be able to sit at the Round Table (one such case is if a knight hates every other knight, but there are many other possible reasons). If a knight cannot sit at the Round Table, then he cannot be a member of the Knights of the Round Table and must be expelled from the order. These knights have to be transferred to a less-prestigious order, such as the Knights of the Square Table, the Knights of the Octagonal Table, or the Knights of the Banana-Shaped Table. To help Merlin, you have to write a program that will determine the number of knights that must be expelled.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several blocks of test cases.

Texas is the state having the largest number of cows in the US: according to the 2005 report of the NationalAgricultural Statistics Service, the bovine population of Texas is 13.8 million. This is higher than thepopulation of the two runner-up states combined: there are only 6.65 million cows in Kansas and 6.35millions cows in Nebraska.

<P>
There are several diseases that can threaten a herd of cows, the most feared being ``Mad Cow Disease" or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE); therefore, it is very important to be able to diagnose certain illnesses. Fortunately, there are many tests available that can be used to detect these diseases.

<P>
A test is performed as follows. First a blood sample is taken from the cow, then the sample is mixed with a test material. Each test material detects a certain number of diseases. If the test material is mixed with a blood sample having any of these diseases, then a reaction takes place that is easy to observe. However, if a test material can detect several diseases, then we have no way to decide which of these diseases is present in the blood sample as all of them produce the same reaction. There are materials that detect many diseases (such tests can be used to rule out several diseases at once) and there are tests thatdetect only a few diseases (they can be used to make an accurate diagnosis of the problem).

<P>
The test materials can be mixed to create new tests. If we have a test material that detects diseases A and B; and there is another test material that detects diseases B and C, then they can be mixed toobtain a test that detects diseases A, B, and C. This means that if we have these two test materials, then there is no need for a test material that tests diseases A, B, and C-such a material can be obtained bymixing these two.

<P>
Producing, distributing, and storing many different types of test materials is very expensive, and inmost cases, unnecessary. Your task is to eliminate as many unnecessary test materials as possible. Ithas to be done in such a way that if a test material is eliminated, then it should be possible to mix an equivalent test from the remaining materials. (``Equivalent" means that the mix tests exactly the samediseases as the eliminated material, not more, not less).

Once upon a time in the west...  The quiet life of the villages on the western frontier are often stirred up by the appearance of mysterious strangers. A stranger might be a bounty hunter looking for a notorious villain, or he might be a dangerous criminal escaping the hand of justice. The number of strangers has become so large that they formed the Mysterious Strangers' Union. If you want to be a mysterious stranger, then you have to apply to the Union, and you have to pass three exams that test the three most important skills: shooting, fist-fighting, and harmonica playing. For each skill, the Admission Committeegives a score between 1 (worst) and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (best). Interestingly enough, there are no two members in the Union having exactly the same skills: for every two member, there is always at least one skill for which they have diofferent scores. Furthermore, it turns out that for every possible combination of scores there is exactly one member having these scores. This means that there are exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> strangers in the union.

<P>
Recently, some members left the Union and they formed the Society of Evil Mysterious Strangers. 
The aim of this group is to commit as many evil crimes as possible, and they are quite successful at 
it. Therefore, the Steering Committee of the Union decided that a Hero is needed who will destroy 
this evil society. A Hero is a mysterious stranger who can defeat every member of the Society of Evil 
Mysterious Strangers. A Hero can defeat a member if the Hero has a higher score in <SPAN  CLASS="textit">at least</SPAN> 
one skill. For example, if the evil society has two members, 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Colonel Bill, with a score of 7 for shooting, 5 for knife throwing and 3 for harmonica playing, and
</LI>
<LI>Rabid Jack, with a score 10 for shooting, 6 for knife throwing and 8 for harmonica playing,
</LI>
</UL>
then a Hero with score 8 for shooting, 7 for knife throwing and 3 for harmonica playing can defeat both ofthem. However, someone with a score of 8 for shooting 6 for knife throwing and 8 for harmonica playing cannot be the Hero. Moreover, the Hero cannot be a member of the evil society.

<P>
Your task is to determine whether there is a member in the Union who can be the Hero. If so, thenyou have to count how many members are potential heroes.

<P>Doubleville, a small town in Texas, was attacked by the aliens. They have abducted some of the residents and taken them to the a spaceship orbiting around earth. After some (quite unpleasant) human experiments, the aliens cloned the victims, and released multiple copies of them back in Doubleville. So now it might happen that there are 6 identical person named Hugh F. Bumblebee: the original person and its 5 copies. The Federal Bureau of Unauthorized Cloning (FBUC) charged you with the task of determining how many copies were made from each person. To help you in your task, FBUC have collected a DNA sample from each person. All copies of the same person have the same DNA sequence, and different people have different sequences (we know that there are no identical twins in the town, this is not an issue).<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several blocks of test cases.

Therefore, the only way <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/35/3528img1.png ALT="$ \Theta$"> - 7</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> can escape is to climb onto the boxes and somehow reach the exit on top of them.

If a box of height <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>h</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is toppled north (west, south, etc.) then it will occupy <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>h</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> consecutive cells to the north (west, south, etc.) of its original position. The original position will be unoccupied (but can be later occupied again by toppling another box). A box can onlybe toppled if the cells where it will fall are unoccupied.

<P>The widget factory produces several different kinds of widgets. Each widget is carefully built by a skilled widgeteer. The time required to build a widget depends on its type: the simple widgets need only 3 days, but the most complex ones may need as many as 9 days.<P>The factory is currently in a state of complete chaos: recently, the factory has been bought by a new owner, and the new director has fired almost everyone. The new staff know almost nothing about building widgets, and it seems that no one remembers how many days are required to build each diofferent type of widget. This is very embarrassing when a client orders widgets and the factory cannot tell the client how many days are needed to produce the required goods. Fortunately, there are records that say for each widgeteer the date when he started working at the factory, the date when he was fired and what types of widgets he built. The problem is that the record does not say the exact date of starting and leaving the job, only the day of the week. Nevertheless, even this information might be helpful in certain cases: for example, if a widgeteer started working on a Tuesday, built a Type 41 widget, and was fired on a Friday,then we know that it takes 4 days to build a Type 41 widget. Your task is to figure out from these records (if possible) the number of days that are required to build the different types of widgets.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several blocks of test cases.

<P>The NASA Space Center, Houston, is less than 200 miles from San Antonio, Texas (the site of the ACM Finals this year). This is the place where the astronauts are trained for Mission Seven Dwarfs, the next giant leap in space exploration. The Mars Odyssey program revealed that the surface of Mars is very rich in yeyenum and bloggium. These minerals are important ingredients for certain revolutionary new medicines, but they are extremely rare on Earth. The aim of Mission Seven Dwarfs is to mine these minerals on Mars and bring them back to Earth.<P>The Mars Odyssey orbiter identified a rectangular area on the surface of Mars that is rich in minerals. The area is divided into cells that form a matrix of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> rows and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> columns, where the rows go from east to west and the columns go from north to south. The orbiter determined the amount of yeyenum and bloggium in each cell. The astronauts will build a yeyenum refinement factory west of the rectangular area and a bloggium factory to the north. Your task is to design the conveyor belt system that will allow them to mine the largest amount of minerals.<P>There are two types of conveyor belts: the first moves minerals from east to west, the second moves minerals from south to north. In each cell you can build either type of conveyor belt, but you cannot build both of them in the same cell. If two conveyor belts of the same type are next to each other, then they can be connected. For example, the bloggium mined at a cell can be transported to the bloggium refinement factory via a series of south-north conveyor belts.<P>The minerals are very unstable, thus they have to be brought to the factories on a straight path without any turns. This means that if there is a south-north conveyor belt in a cell, but the cell north of it contains an east-west conveyor belt, then any mineral transported on the south-north conveyor beltwill be lost. The minerals mined in a particular cell have to be put on a conveyor belt immediately, in the same cell (thus they cannot start the transportation in an adjacent cell). Furthermore, any bloggium transported to the yeyenum refinement factory will be lost, and vice versa.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="492" HEIGHT="297" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/35/p3530.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3530.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>Your program has to design a conveyor belt system that maximizes the total amount of minerals mined,i.e., the sum of the amount of yeyenum transported to the yeyenum refinery and the amount of bloggium transported to the bloggium refinery.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several blocks of test cases.

<P>The Great Plain of Algorithmia plays an extremely important role in the agriculture of the Bandulu Kingdom: this is the only place where barley (<SPAN CLASS="textit">Hordeum vulgare</SPAN>), an essential ingredient of beer, can be produced. Unfortunately, it is not possible to grow barley on the full area of the plain, as several nuclear plants have recently been built, and you cannot grow barley near a nuclear plant (since you do not want to produce giant-size, aggressive, man-eating barley-mutants).

<P>One way for young children in elementary schools to practice addition is to make them write down an addition table. An addition table of size <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is an <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>N</I> + 1) <TT>x</TT> (<I>N</I> + 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> square matrix, where the top row and the left column are labeled with some random integers, (except for their intersection cell where we normally put the plus sign.) The child's task is now to put in each cell the result of adding the label of the row, and the label of the column. For example, the table on the right is an addition table of size 3.<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=4 BORDER FRAME=BOX RULES=GROUPS><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>+</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="textbf">3</SPAN></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="textbf">-2</SPAN></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="textbf">5</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="textbf">1</SPAN></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>4</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>-1</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>6</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="textbf">4</SPAN></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>7</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>2</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>9</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="textbf">-2</SPAN></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>1</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>-4</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>3</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P><P><BR>Once students grow up and enter intermediate-level schools, we can give them the opp osite.

<P>Consider a classical 2-arm 12-hour clock. Now imagine a really precise one. One that can indicate the time in hours, minutes, seconds, and hundredths of a second. Such clock can specify the time between 0:0:0.00 and 11:59:59.99 inclusive. (We'll use the format hour:minute:second.hundredths) to write the time displayed on such clock. Now, you are given two identical clocks of this type, each of them showing some time where the first is strictly before the second. You also know the radius of the clock face. We're interested in computing the area of the clock face determined by the two small (hour) clock-arms on the two clocks.

A `<TT>U</TT>' is an instruction for you to move one unit upward and drawing a segment at the same time. Similarly, `<TT>D</TT>' is for moving down, `<TT>L</TT>' for left, and `<TT>R</TT>' for right.

<P>The scientists have found an ancient device that works in a strange way. The device has a keyboard and an output tape. The keyboard has 26 keys, with symbols `<TT>A</TT>' through `<TT>Z</TT>' on them. Each key has an LED on it (like the Caps Lock key on some keyboards). Each time you press a key, the LED on it toggles (changes its state from <SPAN CLASS="textit">off</SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="textit">on</SPAN> or vice versa). All LEDs are <SPAN CLASS="textit">off</SPAN> initially.<P>To study the output written on the tape, we consider the device in discrete time steps.

<P>Using SMS today is more than a pleasing hobby. As the number of messages one sends through this service grows, the need to type them fast is better felt. Sometimes, one wonders how fast a message can be typed. Changing some words to their synonyms, might help type the whole message faster, if we were able to quickly calculate the time needed for a specific message.<P>In the following, we assume that each message is a string of capital English letters and space character. The letters `<TT>A</TT>' through `<TT>Z</TT>' are assigned to keys `<TT>2</TT>' to `<TT>9</TT>', as in the following figure. To type a letter, one should press its key 1, 2, 3, or 4 times, depending on the position of the letter from left to right.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="267" ALIGN="right" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/35/p3544.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3544.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>If two consecutive letters of the message are mapped to one key, one should wait for the first letter to be fixed on the screen and then use the key again to type the second one. For instance, to type the letter `<TT>X</TT>', one should press `<TT>9</TT>' twice. If the next letter of the message is not on the same key, one can continue to type the rest of the message. Otherwise, one has to wait for some time, so that the typed `<TT>X</TT>' is fixed, and then the next letter (`<TT>W</TT>', `<TT>X</TT>', `<TT>Y</TT>', or `<TT>Z</TT>') can be typed. To type whitespace, we use the key `<TT>1</TT>'. As there is no letter mapped to the key `<TT>1</TT>', the whitespace needs no time to be fixed.<P>You are given the time needed to press any key, and the time one should wait for a letter to be fixed.

<P>You are working for OTC, the Olandican Telecommunication Company. Unfortunately, OTC does not decide wisely in assigning telephone numbers to the clients. For example, it did not make a good estimate on demand increase. As a result, it had to increase the number of digits in the local telephone numbers of Oland (the capital) from six to seven, and then again from seven to eight digits.<P>As usual, a telephone number consists of two parts: an area code, and the local number within that area code. For example, if <TT>021</TT> is the area code of the Oland city, a telephone number in that city may be <TT>0211234567</TT>. Note that no area code is the prefix of another area code.<P>The process of changing telephone numbers is not easy though. It requires updates to several databases of millions of records. Fortunately, these changes follow a limited number of rules as follows:<P><OL><LI>For all local numbers in a given area code, repeat the ith digit. For example, for the area code 021, repeating the second digit causes the number 0211234567 change to 02112234567. </LI><LI>For all numbers in a given area code, swap the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>th and the <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>i</I> + 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>th digit. For example, for the area code <TT>021</TT>, swapping the second and the third digits causes the number <TT>0211234567</TT> change to <TT>0211324567</TT>. </LI><LI>Change a given area code. For example, changing <TT>021</TT> to <TT>0211</TT> causes the number <TT>0211234567</TT> change to <TT>02111234567</TT>. </LI></OL><P>Note that changing area codes in the third rule preserves the property that no area code is the prefix of another. You are to write a program that given the area code information, and the set of all telephone numbers, plus a given set of rules, determine the resulting telephone numbers after the changes.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The first part of the input describes the set of area codes.

Hassan, helping with his younger brother's homework, found out that when you multiply 102564 by 4, its right-most digit moves to the left, and the other digits move one position to the right; i.e. <!-- MATH
 $4 \times 102564 = 410256$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">4 <TT>x</TT> 102564 = 410256</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. We call a number that has this property when multiplied by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, an <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-dramatic number. For instance, 102564 and 128205 are both 4-dramatic. Given two one-digit numbers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>

<P>ACM-ICPC judges, sometimes, play computer games, such as <SPAN CLASS="textit">Alphariz</SPAN>. In the game of <SPAN CLASS="textit">Alphariz</SPAN>, you are given a table (e.g., Table I) of alphabetic characters. At each step of the game, you choose a table entry <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> containing a non-blank character <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ch</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Then, you recursively identify all the friends of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The friends are the existing table entries containing the same character <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ch</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> which are located immediately to the left, right, up, and down directions of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and their friends in turn, until no new friends can be located. Then, you replace the characters in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and its found friends with blanks. Table II shows the result of applying the latter rule on Table I, starting at entry <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> in row 1 and column 2, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ch</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is `<TT>a</TT>'.<P><IMG WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="159" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/35/3547img1.png ALT="$\textstyle \parbox{.5\textwidth}{

In his fabulous trip to El Dorado, Kamran made his fortune. After helping the king solve a difficult math problem, the king granted a piece of royal garden to Kamran. The king wrote a letter to the gardener, so that a rectangular region of the royal garden with a specified area, be given to Kamran. You could guess that the trees in El Dorado are made from Gold! 

<P>
After taking the letter to the royal gardener, Kamran found out that, unfortunately, there is no specific pattern for the location of the trees in the garden. To get the most profit, Kamran talked to the gardener and convinced him that it would not matter much, if Kamran chose the location of his rectangular share, and if he would choose a share smaller than the letter suggests. However, the gardener insisted that Kamran's subgarden should have sides parallel to the garden sides (which is itself a rectangle), and that vertices should have integer coordinates. The area of the piece of land must be positive, so that the king would not suspect anything. 

<P>
Now, given the locations of the trees in the garden and the maximum allowed area of his share, Kamran should find a rectangular sub-garden with maximum number of trees inside; if a tree is on the border of the sub-garden, he can safely claim it.

<P>Attending a boring weekly session, our professor started drawing on a grid in a page of his calendar. He started at a boundary grid point <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>; note that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is a corner of one or two grid cells. He drew a diameter of one of those cells and continued on a straight line until reaching point <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> on another edge of the grid. Then he started another line from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Q</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, perpendicular to the line <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>PQ</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> until hitting another edge at point <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. He kept drawing lines as above, until he could not draw a new line, either because a perpendicular line would not start with a cell diameter or it would fall on an already drawn line. Then he was puzzling how he would be able to count the number of minimal rectangles he has created on the grid.

Our country is under enemy's attack. Hostile bombers are going to fly towards the capital and destroy everything. To defend the capital, we have a number of missiles, ready to launch and hit the enemy's bombers, before they reach the capital. Unfortunately, there are passenger planes in the sky, which we do not want to hit by our missiles. 

<P>
We have been able to gather useful information regarding enemy's bombers. While they taxi over our missile defense zone, bombers travel in a fixed altitude. All bombers fly with the same speed. The same applies to airplanes, and our missiles. We know the location of each bomber and each airplane at time zero. Our missiles are placed on the ground, and their locations are also known.

<P>
You should write a program, that given the information about the bombers, and the locations of passenger planes in the sky, determines the maximum number of bombers that can be successfully hit by our missiles. Then, we pray for the rest of bombers to explode by themselves! 

<P>
To simplify your task, The following are assumed:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>We consider a flat two-dimensional model of the earth. Thus, the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-coordinate of the airplanes, and attacking bombers, does not change during their movement over our defense zone.  
</LI>
<LI>Each defending missile can be fired, at time zero or afterwards.  
</LI>
<LI>The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-coordinate of bombers, and airplanes are distinct positive integers.  
</LI>
<LI>Each bomber or airplane, has unit length, while our missiles have no length.  
</LI>
<LI>If a missile hits, or just touches the edge of a target in the sky, our missile will explode, while the target keeps moving normally on its path for a while before it explodes. Assume that the hit bomber will explode after passing all defending missiles, i.e. after surpassing the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-coordinate of all our missiles. Note that during this time, it may be hit by other missiles.

A computer professor, who is fond of programming, has come to Tehran to pay a visit to our regional contest. After hearing about such an event, he has tried his best to be able to participate in the contest as a visitor. He would decide to hold such contests in his university, if he finds it fun enough. 

<P>
As could be predicted, he has been lost in our large and crowded city, Tehran. He does not know where to go. Getting really tired, he is standing in a city intersection when he suddenly remembers the phone number of a friend in the organizing committee, and instantly calls him. The friend understands the situation and wants to route the professor through mobile phone calls. He plans to give the professor directions at each intersection; i.e. he tells the tired professor in which direction to move, and after reaching the next intersection, there is another phone call, to get the new direction, etc. This process continues, until the professor sees his friend at the destination intersection, waiting for him. Due to poor telecommunications installment, not all city intersections are accessible through mobile network. 

<P>
The professor should get to the regional contest location as soon as possible. There are a number of antennas located in some of city intersections. A city intersection is accessible through the network if an antenna can see the point; i.e. there is an imaginary straight line connecting the intersection to any part of the antenna. The line can never cross a building, but touching a boundary does not block the mobile connection. The city is composed of <!-- MATH
 $R \times C$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I> <TT>x</TT> <I>C</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> rectangular blocks. Each block is a building having 10 meters width and length. 

<P>
You should write a program to find out the shortest possible mobile route; i.e. a route that lets the professor call his friend from each intersection, until reaching the destination. The program is given <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and height of each building and each antenna, and the location of antennas.

<P>Ms. Angel has a degree in computing and also fashion design. Working as a fashion designer she takes photographs of textures she comes across and creates designs based on these textures. Being a smart programmer, she thought she could use her computing background to automatically extract patterns from a captured texture. For example, consider the following sample texture (figure 1):<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="360" HEIGHT="380" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/35/p3556a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3556a.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>This texture is built up from two basic tiles: a vertical striped tile and the horizontal striped tile:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="77" HEIGHT="113" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/35/p3556a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3556b.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>Given these two tiles, Ms Angel is interested in three kinds of bigger patterns: Even-Symmetric pattern, Odd-symmetric pattern, and Unit pattern. She extracts a portion of the texture and terms it as even-symmetric if one half of the portion (in either the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>- or <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-direction) is same as the other half, and as odd-symmetric if one half matches the other half leaving out the center column or row.<P>Examples of the Even-Symmetric patterns in figure 1 are:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="979" HEIGHT="162" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/35/p3556a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3556c.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>Examples of Odd-Symmetric patterns in figure 1 are:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="872" HEIGHT="115" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/35/p3556a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3556d.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>The Unit patterns present in figure 1 are:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="1059" HEIGHT="380" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/35/p3556a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3556e.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>A Unit pattern is one that can be repeated a number of times in order to get the captured texture of figure 1.

<P>You are made the in charge of services at the Taj group of hotels, which has decided to start <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> number of branches in Jaipur, a city known for its water scarcity. Anticipating the heavy water requirement, you meet the Managing Director (MD) of the Water Authorities in Jaipur seeking their help. Your hotel management has asked you to minimize the cost of pipe-laying, and hence you obtain from MD the distances between all pairs of Taj branches in Jaipur. There may be cases where a pair of Taj branch hotels are on either side of a terrain and it may be impossible to have a pipeline between them. The MD also suggests that you should get the metro water pipeline connected to a central Taj branch hotel, and from there on Taj can pump the water to all its branches. Since Taj wishes to minimize the power consumption for pumping water, this central location should also be carefully chosen - the cost of pumping water to a branch hotel is proportional to its distance from the central location. The problem is to determine the optimum pipeline connectivity, along with the central point where you need to connect the metro water pipeline and the pump. The distances of the pipeline on either side of the central point should be very much balanced.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The first line of input will consist of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> - the number of Taj branch hotels.

<P>
Air fares are crazy! The cost of a ticket is determined by numerous factors, and is usually not directly related to the distance traveled. Many travelers try to be creative, sometimes using only parts of tickets with stops in various cities to achieve lower-cost travel. However, the airlines are aware of this behavior, and usually require that the travel covered by a ticket be completed in order and without intervening travel. For example, if you have a ticket for travel from City-1 to City-2 then to City-3, you are not allowed to use only the portion of the ticket for travel from City-2 to City-3. You must always start at the first city on the ticket. In addition, you are not allowed to travel from City-1 to City-2, fly elsewhere and return, and then continue your journey from City-2 to City-3. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Let's consider an example. Suppose you are allowed to purchase three types of tickets: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
<TABLE COLS=3>
<COL ALIGN=LEFT><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COL ALIGN=LEFT>
<TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>
Ticket #1: </TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP> City-1 to City-3 to City-4 </TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP> $225.00 </TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP> 
Ticket #2: </TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP> City-1 to City-2 </TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP> $200.00 </TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP> 
Ticket #3: </TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP> City-2 to City-3 </TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP> $50.00 </TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Suppose you wanted to travel from City-1 to City-3. There are two ways to get there using only the available ticket choices: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
<TABLE COLS=1>
<COL ALIGN=LEFT>
<TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>
Purchase Ticket #1 for $225.00 and use only the first leg of the ticket. </TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP> 
Purchase Ticket #2 for $200.00 and Ticket #3 for $50. </TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The first choice is the cheapest. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Given a set of airline ticket offers, and one or more trip itineraries, you must determine how to purchase tickets in order to minimize the cost of travel. Each trip will be possible.

Input consists of multiple test cases, each describing a set of ticket offers and a set of trip itineraries. 

<P>
Each case begins with a line containing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>NT</I></SPAN>, the number of ticket offers, followed by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>NT</I></SPAN> offer descriptions, one to a line. Each description consists of a positive integer specifying the price of the ticket, the number of cities in the ticket's route, and then that many cities. Each city in a case has an arbitrary, but unique, integer identification number. Note that several tickets may be purchased from the same offer. 

<P>
The next line contains <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>NI</I></SPAN>, the number of trips that are to have their cost minimized. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>NI</I></SPAN> lines follow, giving the itineraries for each trip. Each line consists of the number of cities in the itinerary (including the starting city), followed by that many city identification numbers, given in the order they are to be visited. 

<P>
There will be no more than 20 ticket offers or 20 itineraries in a test case. Each offer and itinerary lists from 2 to 10 cities. No ticket price exceeds $10,000. Adjacent cities in a route or itinerary will be distinct. Tickets and trips are numbered sequentially in each set, starting with 1. 

<P>
The last case is followed by a line containing a zero.

Hugh Samston owns the ``You Want It, Hugh Got It" catering service, which has been asked to supply desserts for the participants in this year's ICPC World Finals. Hugh will provide pie slices topped with ice cream at the various social functions scheduled throughout the week. As with any other dedicated entrepreneur, Hugh would like to offer the best service possible, so he has ordered a wide variety of pies and ice creams to satisfy even the most eclectic tastes. 

<P>
Hugh plans to serve each pie slice with a single scoop of ice cream, leaving the exact combination up to the whim of the customer. But of course, as with any other dedicated entrepreneur, Hugh would also like to make as much profit as possible from this enterprise. He knows ahead of time how much profit he can make on each combination of pie slice and ice cream scoop, as well as which combinations of pie and ice cream should never be put together (example: Peppermint Banana Chunk ice cream on Key Lime pie). 

<P>
Given this information, along with the number of slices and scoops he has of each variety of pie and ice cream, Hugh figures he can determine both the minimum and maximum profits he can expect. Since he hopes to be the caterer at subsequent World Finals, he would like a general program to solve this and future problems.

<P>
You have been struck with inspiration, and are designing a beautiful new art sculpture for the foyer of your local museum. For highly important artistic reasons, you are designing it using very specific materials. However, you are not sure if physics is on your side. Will your sculpture actually stand up? 

<P>
The sculpture will be composed of various ball joints weighing 1 kilogram each, and various rods (of negligible weight) connecting the joints. Rods cannot be stretched or compressed, and they can never detach from a joint. However, they are free to rotate around the joints in any direction. The joints that lie on the ground are glued in place; all others are free to move. For simplicity, you may ignore the effects of intersections of rods; each rod exerts force only on the 2 joints connected to it. Also, any joint that is in the air will have at least one rod coming out that is not parallel to the ground. This prevents the degenerate case where a ball is supported only horizontally by a rigid structure. In real life, it would sag just a little. 

<P>
Write a program to determine whether your structure is static (that is, will not immediately move from the effects of gravity). Note that each rod can transmit an arbitrarily large tensional force along its length, and that ``being static" means that the tensional forces at each joint balance the weight of the joint. 

<P>
If the structure is static, you must also determine whether it is stable (that is, will not move if perturbed slightly by pulling its joints).

<P>

</H2>

<P>
The input contains several sculpture descriptions. Every description begins with a line containing integers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>J</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN>, the number of joints and rods in the structure, respectively. Joints are numbered from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>J</I></SPAN>. The description continues with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>J</I></SPAN> lines, one per joint, each containing 3 floating point numbers giving the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I></SPAN> coordinates of that joint. Following are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN> lines, one per rod, with 2 distinct integers indicating the joints connected by that rod. 

<P>
Each rod is exactly the right length to connect its joints. The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I></SPAN> coordinates will always be non-negative; a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I></SPAN> coordinate of 0 indicates that the joint is on the ground and fixed in place. There are at most 100 joints and 100 rods. 

<P>
The last description is followed by a line containing two zeroes.

<P>The executive officers of the company where you work want to send each other encrypted messages. Rather than use off-the-shelf encryption software such as PGP, they have tasked the IT staff with handling the encryption problem. The IT staff decided on a solution that requires ``public" and ``private" integer keys. The idea is that everyone can see your public key, but only you know your private key.<P>Your best friend in the company is a wonderful person but a not-so-wonderful programmer. He has created a publicprivate key scheme as follows. A public key can be any positive integer. The corresponding private key is the smallest bipartite number that is greater than and a multiple of the public key.<P>A bipartite number is any positive integer that contains exactly 2 distinct decimal digits <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I></SPAN> such that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> is not 0 and all occurrences of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> precede all occurrences of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I></SPAN>. For example 44444411 is bipartite (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> is 4 and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I></SPAN> is 1), So are 41, 10000000, and 5555556. However, neither 4444114 nor 44444 are bipartite.<P>Notice that the large bipartite number 88888888888800000 can be nicely described as 12 8's followed by 5 0's. You can express any bipartite number using four numbers: <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I></SPAN>. The numbers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I></SPAN> are the leading and trailing digits as described above, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> is the number of times the digit <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> appears in the bipartite number, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> is the number of times the digit <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I></SPAN> appears.<P>The trouble with your friend's scheme is that it is not too difficult to compute a private key if you know the public key. You need to convince your friend that his public-private key scheme is inadequate before he loses his job over his bad decision! You must write a program that takes public keys as input and displays the corresponding private keys.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of several test cases.

<P>The aim of data compression is to reduce redundancy in stored or communicated data. This increases effective data density and speeds up data transfer rates. One possible method to compress any binary message is the following:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Replace any maximal sequence of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> 1's with the binary version of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> whenever it shortens the length of the message.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>For example, the compressed form of the data <SPAN CLASS="textbf">11111111</SPAN>00100<SPAN CLASS="textbf">111111111111111</SPAN>0011 becomes <SPAN CLASS="textbf">1000</SPAN>00100<SPAN CLASS="textbf">1111</SPAN>0011. The original data is 32 bits long while the compressed data is only 17 bits long.<P>The drawback of this method is that sometimes the decompression process yields more than one result for the original message, making it impossible to obtain the original message. Write a program that determines if the original message can be obtained from the compressed data when the length of the original message (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN>), the number of 1's in the original message (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>) and the compressed data are given.

For centuries, the clockmaker's art consisted of using gears to connect a shaft, turning at a known rate, to other shafts until, by the proper combination of gears, two shafts could be made to turn at the correct rates to represent minutes and hours.<P>You must write a program that, given an input shaft speed and a collection of gears, computes how the gears can be connected to create a clock with an hour hand and a minute hand.

The plan consists of a sequence of shafts, separated by hyphens. Each shaft is represented by one or two characters. The first character is the name of the driven gear --- the gear on the shaft that is engaged with a gear on the previous shaft. For the input shaft, use an asterisk (<TT>*</TT>) to represent the absence of a driven gear. The second character describing a shaft is the name of the driving gear --- the gear on the shaft that is engaged with a gear on the next shaft. The driven gear and the driving gear can be the same gear, in which case the shaft is described by a single character which is the name of this gear. The last shaft in the plan is the minute shaft, described by a single letter which is the name of its driven gear.<P>The line for the hour hand starts with `<TT>Hours:</TT>' followed by a plan for connecting the input shaft to the hour shaft. Use the same format as the minute plan.<P>Each gear may occur only once in the clock. The minute plan and the hour plan may have an initial part in common, however.

<P>Jack is making a long distance walk with some friends along the old pilgrim road from V&#233;zelay to Santiago de Compostela. Jack administers money for the group. His administration is quite simple. Whenever an amount (&euro; 60, say) has to be paid for the common good he will pay it, and write in his booklet: <TT>PAY 60</TT>.<P>When needed, Jack will ask every member of the group, including himself, to pay an amount (&euro; 50, say) to the collective purse, and write in his booklet: <TT>COLLECT 50</TT>. If the group size is 7, he collects &euro; 350 in total.<P>Unfortunately some of the group members cannot participate in the full walk. So sometimes the group will grow, sometimes it will shrink. How does Jack handle these comings and goings of group members in terms of collective money? Suppose, for example, the group size is 7, and that Jack has &euro; 140 in cash, which is &euro; 20 for every group member. If two group members leave, each will receive &euro; 20, and Jack will write in his booklet: <TT>OUT 2</TT>. If under the same circumstances three new group members arrive, they will each have to pay &euro; 20, and Jack will write: <TT>IN 3</TT>.<P>In these cases the amount in cash could easily be divided, without fractions. As a strange coincidence, this happened during the whole trip. Jack never had to make calculations with fractional numbers of euros.<P>Near the end of the trip, Jack was joined by all his fellow travelers. Nobody was willing to miss the glorious finale of the trip. It was then that Jack tried to remember what the group size had been during each part of the trip. He could not remember.<P>Given a page of Jack's booklet, could you figure out the size of the group at the beginning of that page?<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input file contains several test cases.

<P>Origami, or the art of paper folding, often makes use of ``pockets" of paper, particularly in complicated models made from multiple pieces of paper where a tab on one piece of paper needs to fit into a pocket in another piece of paper. In this problem you must count pockets in a flat folded square of paper. A pocket is defined as any opening (lying between two surfaces of paper) that is accessible from the boundary of the folded piece of paper. Note that one accessible opening can account for several pockets since each open side contributes one pocket. Figure 1 shows an example. Observe that the ``middle" opening (between the second and third layers of paper) contributes 3 to the total pocket count.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="902" HEIGHT="265" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/35/p3568a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3568a.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1: Pockets</DIV><P>Assume the paper is initially lying on a flat surface and is never completely lifted from the surface. All folds will be horizontal or vertical. Fold lines will fall only along equally-spaced crease lines, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> in each direction. On the original unfolded square, creases and edges are numbered from top to bottom and from left to right as shown in Figure 2. Each fold reduces the boundary of the folded piece of paper to a smaller rectangle; the final fold results in a square one unit in each direction. Folds are described using a crease line and a direction. For instance, `<TT>2 U</TT>' means to fold the bottom edge up using horizontal crease 2; `<TT>1 L</TT>' means to fold the right edge to the left using crease 1. (See Figure 2.) After several folds, creases may be aligned (for instance, creases 1 and 3 in Figure 2). Either number may be used to specify a fold along that line (so, in Figure 2, `<TT>1 D</TT>' and `<TT>3 D</TT>' are equivalent instructions after the first fold). Pockets are to be counted for the boundary of the final one-unit square. Once a crease is made it cannot be undone.

<P>In our increasingly interconnected world, it has been speculated that everyone on Earth is related to everyone else by no more than six degrees of separation. In this problem, you must write a program to find the maximum degree of separation for a network of people.<P>For any two people, the degree of separation is the minimum number of relationships that must be traversed to connect the two people. For a network, the maximum degree of separation is the largest degree of separation between any two people in the network. If there is a pair of people in the network who are not connected by a chain of relationships, the network is disconnected.<P>As shown below, a network can be described as a set of symmetric relationships each of which connects two people.

<P>As more and more transactions between companies and people are being carried out electronically over the Internet, secure communications have become an important concern. The Internet Cryptographic Protocol Company (ICPC) specializes in secure business-to-business transactions carried out over a network. The system developed by ICPC is peculiar in the way it is deployed in the network.<P>A network like the Internet can be modeled as a directed graph: nodes represent machines or routers, and edges correspond to direct connections, where data can be transmitted along the direction of an edge. For two nodes to communicate, they have to transmit their data along directed paths from the first node to the second, and from the second node to the first.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="1166" HEIGHT="764" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/35/p3570.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3570.eps}"></DIV><P>To perform a secure transaction, ICPC's system requires the installation of their software not only on the two endnodes that want to communicate, but also on all intermediate nodes on the two paths connecting the end-nodes.

A ``queen" piece on a triangular array of cells, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> cells on a side, can attack any cell on a file parallel to one of the sides containing the queen's cell.  For example, in the array in Figure 1, a queen on the black cell, attacks all of the shaded cells.  The Triangular N-Queens Problem of size <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>, is to find a maximal set of queen positions in a triangular array with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> cells on a side so that no queen is attacking any other queen. For example, the black cells in Figure 2 give a maximal set of queen positions in a size 6 array.  It turns out that a size <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> array always has  <!-- MATH
 $floor((2 \ast N + 1)/3)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>floor</I>((2 <TT>*</TT> <I>N</I> + 1)/3)</SPAN> as the maximal number of non-attacking queen positions.

<P>
The first output line for each problem gives the problem number starting at 1, a single space, the input size, a single space and the number of queen positions.  Following the first line will be the queen positions, 8 positions per line except perhaps for the last line of positions.  Each position has the format open bracket (`<TT>[</TT>'), row number starting with 1, a comma, the position from the left within the row starting at 1 and a close bracket (`<TT>]</TT>'). Positions within a line are separated by a single space.  For example, the queen positions in Figure 2 are <TT>[1,1] [4,2] [5,4] [6,3]</TT>.  The lines of position values are followed by a single blank line.

<P>One of the more popular activities in San Antonio is to enjoy margaritas in the park along the river know as the <SPAN CLASS="textit">River Walk</SPAN>. Margaritas may be purchased at many establishments along the River Walk from fancy hotels to <SPAN CLASS="textit">Joe's Taco and Margarita stand</SPAN>. (The problem is not to find out how Joe got a liquor license. That involves Texas politics and thus is much too difficult for an ACM contest problem.) The prices of the margaritas vary depending on the amount and quality of the ingredients and the ambience of the establishment. You have allocated a certain amount of money to sampling different margaritas.<P>Given the price of a single margarita (including applicable taxes and gratuities) at each of the various establishments and the amount allocated to sampling the margaritas, find out how many different maximal combinations, choosing at most one margarita from each establishment, you can purchase. A valid combination must have a total price no more than the allocated amount and the unused amount (<SPAN CLASS="textit">allocated amount - total price</SPAN>) must be less than the price of any establishment that was not selected.

<P>Bridge is a very complicated card game, and the bidding part is particularly difficult to master. The bidding is made even more difficult because players use different bidding conventions (meanings assigned to bids). In this problem, you are asked to write a program that suggests the first bid that should be made. The bidding conventions described below are simplified from those used by a certain person who shall remain nameless.<P>A bridge hand consists of 13 cards. Each card has a suit (spades, hearts, diamonds, or clubs) and a rank (A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2). Here, the letter T denotes the card whose rank is 10. Before making a bid, an experienced bridge player studies the number of high card points (hcp) in the hand, as well as the distribution (the number of cards in each suit). The hcp contributed by each card is completely determined by its rank as follows:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=2 BORDER FRAME=BOX RULES=GROUPS><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><COLGROUP><COL ALIGN=CENTER><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Rank</SPAN></TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP><SPAN CLASS="textbf">hcp</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>A</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>4</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>K</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>3</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>Q</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>2</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>J</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>1</TD></TR></TBODY><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>others</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=CENTER NOWRAP>0</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P>For example, if the hand is:<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE COLS=2 RULES=GROUPS><COL ALIGN=RIGHT><COL ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=RIGHT NOWRAP>Spades: </TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>A, 2</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=RIGHT NOWRAP>Hearts:</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>K, J, T, 9, 2</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=RIGHT NOWRAP>Diamonds:</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>3</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=RIGHT NOWRAP>Clubs:</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>K, Q, 7, 4, 3</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV><P><P><BR>Then this hand has 13 hcp and a distribution of 5-5-2-1 (the distribution is usually listed in non-increasing order). A balanced distribution is any one of 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, and 5-3-3-2.<P>In bridge, an opening bid is either ``pass" or consists of a level (1-7) and a trump suit. The trump suits are no trump, spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs ranked in decreasing order. Once a hand has been evaluated, the player applies the following list of (simplified) rules to determine the appropriate opening bid. In cases where multiple rules apply, the first one that applies should be used. An ``x" in a distribution can be substituted with any non-negative number. Multiple ``x"s in a distribution are not necessarily the same.<P><OL><LI>With at least 10 hcp and a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I> - <I>x</I> - <I>x</I> - <I>x</I></SPAN> distribution (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I><IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/35/3575img1.png ALT="$ \ge$">8</SPAN>), bid the suit with y cards at the 4 level.

<P>A classic ice-breaking exercise is for a group of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> people to form a circle and then arbitrarily join hands with one another. This forms a ``human knot" since the players' arms are most likely intertwined. The goal is then to unwind the knot to form a circle of players with no arms crossed.<P>We now adapt this game to a more general and more abstract setting where the physical constraints of the problem are gone. Suppose we represent the initial knot with a 2-regular graph inscribed in a circle (i.e., we have a graph with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> vertices with exactly two edges incident on each vertex). Initially, some edges may cross other edges and this is undesirable. This is the ``knot" we wish to unwind.<P>A ``move" involves moving any vertex to a new position on the circle, keeping its edges intact. Our goal is to make the fewest possible moves such that we obtain one <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>-sided polygon with no edge-crossings remaining.<P>For example, here is a knot on 4 vertices inscribed in a circle, but two edges cross each other. By moving vertex 4 down to the position between 2 and 3, a graph without edge-crossings emerges. This was achieved in a single move, which is clearly optimal in this case.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="589" HEIGHT="228" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/35/p3578a.gif ALT="\epsfbox{p3578a.eps}"></DIV><P>When <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> is larger, things may not be quite as clear. Below we see a knot on 6 vertices.

The organizers of the Annual Computing Meeting have invited a number
of vendors to set up booths in a large exhibition hall during the meeting to
showcase their latest products.  As the vendors set up their booths at
their assigned locations, they discovered that the organizers did not
take into account an important fact--each vendor supports either
the Doors operating system or the Penguin operating system, but not
both.  A vendor supporting one operating system does not want a booth
next to one supporting another operating system.

<P>
Unfortunately the booths have already been assigned and even set up.
There is no time to reassign the booths or have them moved.  To make
matter worse, these vendors in fact do not even want to be in the
same room with vendors supporting a different operating system.

<P>
Luckily, the organizers found some portable partition screens to
build a wall that can separate the two groups of vendors.  They have
enough material to build a wall of any length.  The screens can only
be used to build a straight wall.  The organizers need your help to
determine if it is possible to separate the two groups of vendors by a
single straight wall built from the portable screens.  The wall built
must not touch any vendor booth (but it may be arbitrarily close to
touching a booth).  This will hopefully prevent one of the vendors from
knocking the wall over accidentally.

Your little brother, Joey, has recently learned that if the sum of digits in a number is divisible by 3 the number is divisible by 3. Joey now thinks that all numbers that are divisible by the sum of their digits are divisible by 3. 

You tell Joey that the number 2 is divisible by the sum of its digits but not divisible by 3, so Joey decides all numbers <SPAN  CLASS="textit">greater than 10</SPAN> that are divisible by the sum of their digits are divisible by 3. You think fast and tell Joey that the number 20 is divisible by the sum of its digits but not divisible by 3, so Joey decides all numbers <SPAN  CLASS="textit">greater than 20</SPAN> that are divisible by the sum of their digits are divisible by 3. 

You're quickly getting tired of doing math, so decide to write a program that will find the smallest number greater than a given number that is divisible by the sum of its digits, but not divisible by 3.

All the lawns I mow are rectangular, having a width and length measured in discrete units corresponding to the cutting diameter of my lawn mower blade. Thus, the lawns can be thought of as made up of unit squares. The first two lawns in the example diagram below have a width of 6, and a length of 5. 

My self-propelled lawn mower takes time <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I><SUB>s</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> to traverse a unit square while moving in a straight direction, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I><SUB>c</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> when I have to make a 90<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUP><TT>o</TT></SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> turn, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I><SUB>r</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the total time to make two consecutive 90Ã‚Â° turns. (I don't worry about missing corners of the unit areas due to circular cutting.) 

I can mow the lawn in either a back-and-forth pattern, or in a spiral pattern (see figures below), but I always want to do it in the least time. To help me to decide which pattern to use, I need a program to calculate the time required to mow the lawn using either one of the patterns. 

I always start in the upper-left corner, initially facing in the rightward direction. The last square mowed never involves a turn (unless it has to).

You have probably all seen maze problems where the maze is described using ASCII characters. For example, a maze might be described as:

<P>
<BR>

<PRE>
.XX 
... 
XX.
</PRE>

<P>
<BR>
where `<TT>.</TT>' represents a free space in the maze and `<TT>X</TT>' represents a wall. 

But there are other ways to represent mazes that are based on the logical structure of the maze instead of its appearance. One such way uses parentheses and underscores to represent the structure of a maze. These are used as follows:

<UL>
<LI>`<TT>_</TT>': a location occupied by a wall; 
</LI>
<LI>`<TT>(</TT>' <SPAN  CLASS="textit">north-loc-desc</SPAN> `<TT>,</TT>'<SPAN  CLASS="textit">west-loc-desc</SPAN>`<TT>,</TT>'<SPAN  CLASS="textit">south-loc-desc</SPAN>`<TT>,</TT>'<SPAN  CLASS="textit">east-loc-desc</SPAN>`<TT>)</TT>': an empty location that has not been described previously. Within the set of parentheses will be four other descriptions, defining the neighbors of this empty location; 
</LI>
<LI>`<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>*</TT></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>': an empty location that has already been described.
</LI>
</UL>

Any space outside the boundaries of the maze will be represented as containing a wall, but these extra walls will not be shown in the final maze. So the description <TT>(_,_,_,_)</TT> describes an empty location with walls to its north, west, south, and east, or the maze:

<P>
<BR>

<PRE>
.
</PRE>

<P>
<BR>

(That's just a single empty location.) 

A slightly more complicated maze is represented by the description <TT>(_,_,(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>*</TT></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>,_,_(_,<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>*</TT></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>,_,_)),_)</TT>. Here there are walls to the north and the west of the starting empty location. The cell to the south of the starting location is described by <TT>(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>*</TT></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>,_,_(_,<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>*</TT></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>,_,_))</TT>. The cell to the north is a cell that's previously been described. There are walls to the west and south. The cell to the east is defined by <TT>(_,<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>*</TT></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>,_,_)</TT>, an empty cell with walls to the north, south, and east and a previously described location to the west. All of this description ultimately gives the maze:

<P>
<BR>

<PRE>
.X 
..
</PRE>

<P>
<BR>
You are to write a program that will translate from the parenthesized description of a maze to an ASCII version of the maze.

In an old Chinese game, there is some number of piles of pebbles. You and your opponent take turns in removing any positive number of pebbles from a single pile. The objective is to be in a position to remove the last pile. 

There is a winning strategy: express the number of pebbles in the piles in binary and see to it that, after your turn, the total number of non-zero digits in any binary place value is even. Of course, if this is already true when it is your turn, it will no longer be true after your turn. In that case, you simply remove one pebble from the first largest pile (and hope that your opponent doesn't know the winning strategy!). 

Say that 4 piles have the following numbers of pebbles:

<P>
<BR>

<TT> 8 = 1000<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark></TT> 
 
<TT> 9 = 1001<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark></TT> 

<TT> 3 = 0011<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark></TT> 

<TT>11 = 1011<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark></TT>

<P>
<BR>
The first, and last binary place values (columns) have an odd number of non-zero digits. There are three ways to make all place values even: reduce the first pile to 1, reduce the second pile to zero, or reduce the fourth pile to 2. To provide a unique answer, we will specify that we should always take pebbles from the first largest pile for which it is possible to make all place values even. Thus, in the above case, you should remove 9 pebbles from the fourth pile. 

We would like to have a program that tells us what to do on our turn for various game situations.

You have a rectangular grid of cells, each of which can contain:

 ALT="$ \Box$"></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>), 
</LI>
<LI>nothing.
</LI>
</UL>

Cells containing a brick cannot contain anything else. Bricks exist in at least all border cells of the grid. In any initial configuration, there is exactly one cell containing a pusher, and exactly one (different) cell containing a block. Since the block is smaller than a hole, it will fall into it (and disappear), if it is moved to a hole (i.e., a cell having a hole). Since the pusher is larger than the hole, it can move into and over a cell having a hole without falling in. The pusher is allowed to move into a horizontally or vertically adjacent cell, unless that cell contains a brick. If the pusher is moved into a cell containing the block, the block moves one cell over in the same direction (i.e., the block is `pushed' by the pusher). However, a pusher move is not allowed if it would push a block into a cell containing a brick. The goal is, by a sequence of allowed pusher moves, to eventually push the block to a specified position, (without, of course, the block having fallen into a hole). 

Consider the following initial grid configuration below, in which the goal is to move the block from initial position (using <!-- MATH
 $(row, column)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>row</I>, <I>column</I>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> coordinates) (2,3) to a target position at (1,1). This is possible by moving the pusher to (1,3) via an existing path of empty cells. The pusher can then be moved downward to (3,3), at the same time pushing the block downward to (4,3). After moving the pusher from (3,3) to (4,4) via a path of empty cells, the block can then be pushed to (4,2). The pusher can then be moved to (5,2), then to (4,2), pushing the block to (3,2). The pusher is then moved to (3,3) and then to (3,2), pushing the block to (3,1). Finally, the pusher is moved to (4,1) (over the hole), and then to (2,1), pushing the block to its target destination, (1,1).

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<!-- MATH
 $\epsfbox{p3590.eps}$

 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/35/p3590a.jpg
 ALT="\epsfbox{p3590.eps}">
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>
</DIV>
Now consider again the same grid configuration as above, but where the target position is (1,2). The goal is not achievable (try it!). 

For given initial grid configurations, we would like to know if it is possible to push the object block into a given target position. That is, we want to know if there exists at least one way to ``solve" the configuration.

The local park has two parallel walking tracks, each of which is booked on Saturday mornings by two walking clubs; the Greater Strolling Unicorns (GSU), and the Unparalleled Speedwalking Association (USA). Both of these tracks have a common entrance that also serves as its exit, and requires all members to walk the same direction. Each member of both clubs is totally consistent and always takes the same amount of time to complete a lap. 

USA members are super competitive, and are a little more happy each time they pass a GSU member, and a little less happy each time they are passed by a GSU member. Since members of both clubs don't slow down or speed up, USA has figured out that they can maximize their members' happiness by having them change their starting time. Of course, they can't change the start timing too much, but they've discovered members are willing to stretch up to 5 minutes longer, so can change the start time by at most that much. 

USA wants to try optimizing each individual member's happiness by changing his/her start time and is asking you to write a program to determine that member's optimal start time, given a group of GSU members using the other track.

Halloween is coming soon and you've been asked to create a program to help parents and children get just what they want. Parents want to give children an upper bound on the amount of candy they can receive and children want as much candy as they get without upsetting their parents. 

Fortunately, in our neighborhoods, we know in advance exactly how many pieces of candy each home hands out to the children. A child has to take all the candy given by the home so they don't seem rude, and they can't throw away or eat any candy on the way. Children also have to stop at every home in the sequence of homes. 

Given these conditions, write a program to find the best sequence of homes for children to visit.

To encourage people to live up to its name--Convivialville--the town has inaugurated the Whoop-de-doo club. The by-laws of the club are as follows: 

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>I.</DT>
<DD>Membership is restricted to two-handed people over the age of 16.  
</DD>
<DT>II.</DT>
<DD>The club will meet at or about 8 PM on Saturdays in the local fire station. 
</DD>
<DT>III.</DT>
<DD>The first member to arrive will not participate in the fun (see below), but will be secretary for the current meeting [hint: don't arrive too early!]. The duty of secretary is preparing a box of 26 name tags labeled only with the upper-case characters A though Z (to keep anonymity), and making sure that at least 26 blindfolds are available 
</DD>
<DT>IV.</DT>
<DD>As members arrive they will randomly choose a name tag from the box. In the rare event the box is empty, those members will be turned away [hint: don't arrive too late!] 
</DD>
<DT>V.</DT>
<DD>At some point in the evening, the secretary blows one blast on a whistle, and everyone puts on a blindfold. Then, when everyone is blindfolded, the secretary blows two blasts, everyone has to move around, and organize themselves such that each hand is holding the hand of a different person. 
</DD>
<DT>VI.</DT>
<DD>When all hands are held, the secretary quickly writes down (for the minutes of the meeting) all pairs of hands held. The notation ``A B" represents that the person with name tag A holds the hand of the person with name tag B. This fact could equivalently have been noted as ``B A" (duh<SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>) 
</DD>
<DT>VII.</DT>
<DD>The secretary then determines from his/her minutes whether the handholding group forms a single cyclic chain. If it is, the secretary gives a triple blast, and everyone yells ``Whoop-de-doo!" Otherwise, the secretary blows one long blast, and everyone says a mournful ``Ohh". 
</DD>
<DT>VIII.</DT>
<DD>Then everyone removes their blindfolds, has some more fruit punch, and, in any case, goes home with an added sense of conviviality.
</DD>
</DL>

Your job is to make the secretary's job easier by determining, from the notations in the minutes, whether everyone forms a single cyclic chain. Unfortunately, the secretary in his/her eagerness not to overlook any handholding pairs may accidentally include redundant information. In spite of this eagerness, occasionally, he/she may forget to note a handholding pair (but never more than one).

<P>A checksum is an algorithm that scans a packet of data and returns a single number. The idea is that if the packet is changed, the checksum will also change, so checksums are often used for detecting transmission errors, validating document contents, and in many other situations where it is necessary to detect undesirable changes in data.<P>For this problem, you will implement a checksum algorithm called Quicksum. A Quicksum packet allows only uppercase letters and spaces. It always begins and ends with an uppercase letter. Otherwise, spaces and letters can occur in any combination, including consecutive spaces.<P>A Quicksum is the sum of the products of each character's position in the packet times the character's value. A space has a value of zero, while letters have a value equal to their position in the alphabet. So, <TT>A</TT>=1, <TT>B</TT>=2, etc., through <TT>Z</TT>=26.

<P>This problem is inspired by <SPAN ID="txt48">Pachinko</SPAN>, a popular game in Japan. A traditional Pachinko machine is a cross between a vertical pinball machine and a slot machine. The player launches small steel balls to the top of the machine using a plunger as in pinball. A ball drops through a maze of pins that deflect the ball, and eventually the ball either exits at a hole in the bottom and is lost, or lands in one of many gates scattered throughout the machine which reward the player with more balls in varying amounts. Players who collect enough balls can trade them in for prizes.<P>For the purposes of this problem, a <SPAN CLASS="textit">linear</SPAN> Pachinko machine is a sequence of one or more of the following: holes (``<TT>.</TT>"), floor tiles (``<TT>_</TT>"), walls (``<TT>|</TT>"), and mountains (``<code>/\</code>"). A wall or mountain will never be adjacent to another wall or mountain. To play the game, a ball is dropped at random over some character within a machine. A ball dropped into a hole falls through. A ball dropped onto a floor tile stops immediately. A ball dropped onto the left side of a mountain rolls to the left across any number of consecutive floor tiles until it falls into a hole, falls off the left end of the machine, or stops by hitting a wall or mountain. A ball dropped onto the right side of a mountain behaves similarly. A ball dropped onto a wall behaves as if it were dropped onto the left or right side of a mountain, with a 50<SPAN CLASS="MATH">%</SPAN> chance for each. If a ball is dropped at random over the machine, with all starting positions being equally likely, what is the probability that the ball will fall either through a hole or off an end? For example, consider the following machine, where the numbers just indicate character positions and are not part of the machine itself:<P><P><BR><PRE>

Each disk then freezes into place, so it cannot be moved by later disks. Your job is to find the overall height of the final combination of disks.<P>So that the answer is unique, assume that any disk reaching the bottom of the box rolls as far to the left as possible. Also the data is chosen so there will be a unique lowest position for any disk that does not reach the bottom.

The illustrations above show white filled disks labeled with the order in which they fall into their boxes. The gray circle in the fourth illustration is not intended to be a disk that fell in.

For this problem you will write a search engine that takes a query, searches a collection of words, and finds the lexicographically smallest word that matches the query (i.e., the matching word that would appear first in an English dictionary). A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">query</SPAN> is a sequence of one or more terms separated by single vertical bars (``<TT>|</TT>"). A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">term</SPAN> is one or more letters followed by zero or more signed letters. A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">signed</SPAN> letter is either <TT>+</TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> (`positive" <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>) or <TT>-</TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> (``negative" <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>), where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> is a single letter. All letters are lowercase, and no letter will appear more than once within a term. A query will not contain spaces.

<P>The Gorelians travel through space using warp links. Travel through a warp link is instantaneous, but for safety reasons, an individual can only warp once every 10 hours. Also, the cost of creating a warp link increases directly with the linear distance between the link endpoints.<P>The Gorelians, being the dominant force in the known universe, are often bored, so they frequently conquer new regions of space in the following manner.<P><OL><LI>The initial invasion force finds a suitable planet and conquers it, establishing a Regional Gorelian Galactic Government, hereafter referred to as the RGGG, that will govern all Gorelian matters in this region of space. </LI><LI>When the next planet is conquered, a single warp link is constructed between the new planet and the RGGG planet. Planets connected via warp links in this manner are said to be part of the Regional Gorelian Planetary Network, that is, the RGPN. </LI><LI>As additional planets are conquered, each new planet is connected with a single warp link to the nearest planet already in the RGPN, thus keeping the cost of connecting new planets to the network to a minimum. If two or more planets are equidistant from the new planet, the new planet is connected to whichever of them was conquered first. </LI></OL><P>This causes a problem however. Since planets are conquered in a more-or-less random fashion, after a while, the RGGG will probably not be in an ideal location. Some Gorelians needing to consult with the RGGG might only have to make one or two warps, but others might require dozens--very inconvenient when one considers the 10-hour waiting period between warps.<P>So, once each Gorelian year, the RGGG analyzes the RGPN and relocates itself to an optimal location. The optimal location is defined as a planet that minimizes the maximum number of warps required to reach the RGGG from any planet in the RGPN. As it turns out, there is always exactly one or two such planets. When there are two, they are always directly adjacent via a warp link, and the RGGG divides itself evenly between the two planets.<P>Your job is to write a program that finds the optimal planets for the RGGG. For the purposes of this problem, the region of space conquered by the Gorelians is defined as a cube that ranges from (0,0,0) to (1000,1000,1000).<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of a set of scenarios where the Gorelians conquer a region of space.

It consists of four different nucleotides, namely Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine as shown in Figure 1. If we represent a nucleotide by its initial character, a DNA strand can be regarded as a long string (sequence of characters) consisting of the four characters A, T, G, and C. For example, assume we are given some part of a DNA strand which is composed of the following sequence of nucleotides:<P><BR>``Thymine-Adenine-Adenine-Cytosine-Thymine-Guanine-Cytosine-Cytosine-Guanine-Adenine-Thymine"<P><BR>Then we can represent the above DNA strand with the string ``TAACTGCCGAT." The biologist Prof. Ahn found that a gene X commonly exists in the DNA strands of five different kinds of animals, namely dogs, cats, horses, cows, and monkeys. He also discovered that the DNA sequences of the gene X from each animal were very alike.

DNA sequences of gene X in five animals.</DIV><P><BR>Prof. Ahn thought that humans might also have the gene X and decided to search for the DNA sequence of X in human DNA. However, before searching, he should define a representative DNA sequence of gene X because its sequences are not exactly the same in the DNA of the five animals. He decided to use the Hamming distance to define the representative sequence. The Hamming distance is the number of different characters at each position from two strings of equal length. For example, assume we are given the two strings ``<TT>AGCAT</TT>" and ``<TT>GGAAT</TT>." The Hamming distance of these two strings is 2 because the 1st and the 3rd characters of the two strings are different. Using the Hamming distance, we can define a representative string for a set of multiple strings of equal length.

For example, given the three strings ``<TT>AGCAT</TT>" ``<TT>AGACT</TT>" and ``<TT>GGAAT</TT>" the consensus string of the given strings is ``<TT>AGAAT</TT>" because the sum of the Hamming distances between ``<TT>AGAAT</TT>" and the three strings is 3 which is minimal. (In this case, the consensus string is unique, but in general, there can be more than one consensus string.) We use the consensus string as a representative of the DNA sequence.

Kim works in a traveling agency in Korea. Recently, his foreign customer gave him an international call and asked him to make a travel plan in Korea. The customer wants to visit two famous roads along which beautiful flowers are in full blossom. The customer would like to fly to a city in the plan and rent a car, enjoy his travel, and return to the city where he started. He does not want to visit the same city or the same road twice. Also, he hates to travel along any toll roads. It does not matter how many cities are included in the plan. Can Kim make a travel plan satisfying the requirements? 

For example, see the maps in Figure 1. In the figure a circle represents a city and the line between two cities represents the road between them. The two bold lines represent the famous roads that the customer wants to visit and the dotted line is a toll road.

A college student Ji-Sung has a roommate, Young-Pyo, who shares a room with him in the dormitory. Since they have lived together for a long time, they also share household facilities, for example, a hair dryer, an electric iron, a battery charger, etc. So the time periods when they want to use one facility should not overlap.

Some day, Ji-Sung and Young-Pyo both have a sequence of facilities <!-- MATH

 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>O</I><SUB>i<SUB>1</SUB></SUB>, <I>O</I><SUB>i<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>,..., <I>O</I><SUB>i<SUB>n</SUB></SUB></SPAN>

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> , respectively, which they want to use in this order. Here a facility can be used more than once, that is, <!-- MATH

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>O</I><SUB>i<SUB>k</SUB></SUB> = <I>O</I><SUB>i<SUB>l</SUB></SUB></SPAN>

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> time units that Ji-Sung and Young-Pyo use the facility <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>o</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, respectively. The problem is to minimize the finishing time by which they have used all facilities. 

For example, Ji-Sung and Young-Pyo share household facilities <!-- MATH

 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>O</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>O</I><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>O</I><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN>

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> test tubes <SPAN CLASS="MATH">{<I>t</I><SUB>i</SUB>}</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> containing different liquid chemicals. And we have <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I>&nbsp;<I>mg</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (milligram) of another chemical C in a beaker. If we put <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> mg of C into a test tube <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> , then G (a sort of gas) is produced in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The amount of G produced in each <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (unit is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">mg</SPAN>), where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the amount of C put into <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Note that we can only measure integer amount of C, and so every <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> should be an integer.

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> , then 122 <SPAN  CLASS="textit">mg</SPAN> of G is produced. This experiment has a requirement, that is, we must equalize the amount of G produced in every <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> by carefully distributing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> over all <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>

A mountainous region had many forest fires in the dry season of the last year. Prior to the dry season of this year, to watch the forest fire, you are planning to construct a fire tower which enables us to watch all mountain slopes. To minimize the construction cost, you want to minimize the height of the fire tower.

There are sports facilities in the mountain at the back of our village for the villagers to build up their physical strength. One of the facilities consists of many logs placed along a straight trail through the forest. All the logs are of the same length and are placed in a parallel direction to the trail. `Log jumping' is one of the famous games played in the facility. The game, which involves mental skills, is to visit as many logs as possible in the following way.

<OL>
<LI>One first selects an arbitrary log and visits the log. Visiting means jumping on the log. Moving on the log is allowed. 
</LI>
<LI>Next, he/she selects an unvisited log and visits it. The direction of jumping should be perpendicular to the direction of logs. Repeat Step 2 if he/she wants. 
</LI>
<LI>The last log visited should be identical to the first one. Visiting a log except the first/last one is allowed at most one time. When one returns to the first log, the game ends.
</LI>
</OL>

For example, let us have eight logs of length five numbered from 1 to 8 as depicted in the figure below. Starting with Log 2, we can jump on Log 4, then jump on Log 7, Log 8, Log 5, and finally we can return to Log 2 visiting totally five logs. We can not visit more than five logs according to the above way, so the maximum number of logs one can visit is five.

Given the length and positions of logs, Ha-Jin wants to find an efficient method to determine the maximum number of logs she can visit. Write a program that can help her. When the position of the right endpoint of a log coincides with the position of the left endpoint of another log, it is assumed that one can jump from one log to the other log, and vice versa. In the above figure, jumping from Log 1 to Log 4 or jumping from Log 4 to Log 1 is possible.

``You want to build an office building in our town? Wonderful! We're so glad to have you!" The mayor was beaming as he led me back into City Hall. ``We just need to make sure your building permit application meets all the town zoning regulations. We can check that immediately." 

<P>
He led me through a door labelled ``Zoning". I was staggered by the sight of a huge room with row after row of desks. At each desk sat a clerk with a logbook, an inbox, and a generaous supply of pencils and erasers. 

<P>
The mayor took my application form, then flourished a sheet of paper containing several lines of numbered boxes. He placed the paper in the inbox of the nearest desk and said, ``We just run this past our zoning clerks, and if it gets back to this desk with all the boxes checked, then your application is approved." The clerk at the desk grabbed the form from the inbox, marked checks in a few boxes, wrote a few lines into a logbook on his desk, then ran to a nearby copier, made copies of the form and distributed to several other desks. I watched as the clerks at those other desks each added more checks but also erased some, wrote in their logbooks, made copies, and distributed the altered forms. Soon copies of the form seemed to be flying all around the room. 

<P>
I turned to the mayor and said, ``But none of them actually <SPAN  CLASS="textit">looked</SPAN> at my application!". 

<P>
``Oh no", said the Mayor, ``each of our clerks has carefully studied a few parts of our zoning regulations. Some are convinced that <SPAN  CLASS="textit">any</SPAN> application will automatically satisfy some of the zoning rules. They also believe that <SPAN  CLASS="textit">no</SPAN> application will ever satisfy some of the other rules. So each clerk simply checks off some boxes and erases the check marks from some others." 

<P>
``We're very proud", he added, ``of the decisive nature of our zoning process. We recruit our staff from the nearby law school and choose only the most officious and argumentative junior students." 

<P>
``How," I asked, ``do they decide where the marked-up copies should go?" 

<P>
``I'm not really sure," said the mayor. ``I think they mainly give them to their fellow clerks that they most dislike, trying to increase the workload of their enemies." Just then a sheet of paper was placed on the closest desk. ``Let's see how you're coming along", he said, picking up the paper. ``No, still four boxes left empty. We'll just have to wait and see if you can do better." 

<P>
I sighed and said, ``It seems to me that this could go on forever." 

<P>
``No", said the mayor. ``Each clerk keeps a logbook recording all the versions of your application that they have sent on. When they get a form, they start by adding all marks they have ever seen on prior versions of the form, then do their own marks and erasures. If, after all that, it matches one of the previous versions, they won't send it on a second time." 

<P>
I resigned myself to a long wait.

<P>After counting so many stars in the sky in his childhood, Isaac, now an astronomer and a mathematician, uses a big astronomical telescope and lets his image processing program count stars.

<P>A positive integer may be expressed as a sum of different prime numbers (primes), in one way or another. Given two positive integers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>, you should count the number of ways to express <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> as a sum of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> different primes. Here, two ways are considered to be the same if they sum up the same set of the primes. For example, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">8</SPAN> can be expressed as <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3 + 5</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">5 + 3</SPAN> but they are not distinguished.<P>When <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> are <SPAN CLASS="MATH">24</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3</SPAN> respectively, the answer is two because there are two sets <SPAN CLASS="MATH">{2, 3, 19}</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">{2, 5, 17}</SPAN> whose sums are equal to <SPAN CLASS="MATH">24</SPAN>. There are no other sets of three primes that sum up to <SPAN CLASS="MATH">24</SPAN>. For <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> = 24</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> = 2</SPAN>, the answer is three, because there are three sets <SPAN CLASS="MATH">{5, 19}</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">{7, 17}</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">{11, 13}</SPAN>. For <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> = 2</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> = 1</SPAN>, the answer is one, because there is only one set <SPAN CLASS="MATH">{2}</SPAN> whose sum is <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2</SPAN>.

The ultimate Tantra is said to have been kept in the most
distinguished temple deep in the sacred forest somewhere in Japan.
Paleographers finally identified its location, surprisingly a small
temple in Hiyoshi, after years of eager research.  The temple has an
underground secret room built with huge stones.  This underground
megalith is suspected to be where the Tantra is enshrined.

<P>
The room door is, however, securely locked.  Legends tell that the key
of the door lock was an integer, that only highest priests knew.  As
the sect that built the temple decayed down, it is impossible to know
the integer now, and the Agency for Cultural Affairs bans breaking up
the door.  Fortunately, a figure of a number of rods that might be
used as a clue to guess that secret number is engraved on the door.

<P>
Many distinguished scholars have challenged the riddle, but no one
could have ever succeeded in solving it, until recently a brilliant
young computer scientist finally deciphered the puzzle.  Lengths of
the rods are multiples of a certain unit length.  He found that, to
find the secret number, all the rods should be placed on a grid of the
unit length to make one convex polygon.  Both ends of each rod must be
set on grid points.  Elementary mathematics tells that the polygon's
area ought to be an integer multiple of the square of the unit length.
The area size of the polygon with the largest area is the secret
number which is needed to unlock the door.

<P>
For example, if you have five rods whose lengths are 1, 2, 5,
5, and 5, respectively, you can make essentially only three kinds of
polygons, shown in Figure 7.  Then, you know that the
maximum area is 19.

In the year 29XX, the government of a small country somewhere on the
earth introduced a law restricting first names of the people only to
traditional names in their culture, in order to preserve their
cultural uniqueness.  The linguists of the country specifies a set of
rules once every year, and only names conforming to the rules are
allowed in that year.  In addition, the law also requires each person
to use a name of a specific length calculated from one's birth date
because otherwise too many people would use the same very popular
names.  Since the legislation of that law, the common task of the
parents of new babies is to find the name that comes first in the
alphabetical order among the legitimate names of the given length
because names earlier in the alphabetical order have various benefits
in their culture.

<P>
Legitimate names are the strings consisting of only lowercase letters
that can be obtained by repeatedly applying the rule set to the
initial string ``S'', a string consisting only of a single uppercase
S.

<P>
Applying the rule set to a string is to choose one of the rules and
apply it to the string.  Each of the rules has the form <!-- MATH

<P>
Applying the rule (1) to ``S'', ``aAB'' is obtained.  Applying (2) to
it results in ``aB'', as A is replaced by an empty string.  Then, the
rule (4) can be used to make it ``aAbbA''.  Applying (3) to the first
occurrence of A makes it ``aAabbA''.  Applying the rule (2) to the A at
the end results in ``aAabb''.  Finally, applying the rule (2) again to
the remaining A results in ``aabb''.  As no uppercase letter remains
in this string, ``aabb'' is a legitimate name.

<P>
We denote such a rewriting process as follows.

Also, the rule (3) can never be used, as its left hand side, B, does
not appear anywhere else.

<P>
It may happen that no rules are supplied for some uppercase letters
appearing in the rewriting steps.  In its extreme case, even S might
have no rules for it in the set, in which case there are no legitimate
names, of course.  Poor nameless babies, sigh!

<P>Isaac is tired of his daily trip to his office, using the same shortest route everyday. Although this saves his time, he must see the same scenery again and again. He cannot stand such a boring commutation any more.<P>One day, he decided to improve the situation. He would change his route everyday at least slightly. His new scheme is as follows.

In general, on the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>-th day, the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>-th shortest route is chosen.

You've got a queue. And you just got to mess with it. Given a queue of items and a series of queue operations, return the resulting queue. Queue operations are defined as follows:

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<!-- MATH
 $starting-position$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>starting</I> - <I>position</I></SPAN> to <!-- MATH
 $requested-position$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>requested</I> - <I>position</I></SPAN>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
meaning one wants the item at the starting position to be moved to the requested position. So if the queue of items were:

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<!-- MATH
 $Item1 \ Item2 \ Item3 \ Item4 \ Item5$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Item</I>1&nbsp;<I>Item</I>2&nbsp;<I>Item</I>3&nbsp;<I>Item</I>4&nbsp;<I>Item</I>5</SPAN>

<P>

<P>
<BR>

(<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Item</I>1</SPAN> being in position 1, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Item</I>2</SPAN> in position 2, etc.) 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
after applying the queue operation: 5 to 2 the resulting queue would be:

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<!-- MATH
 $Item1 \ Item5 \ Item2 \ Item3 \ Item4$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Item</I>1&nbsp;<I>Item</I>5&nbsp;<I>Item</I>2&nbsp;<I>Item</I>3&nbsp;<I>Item</I>4</SPAN>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Item</I>5</SPAN> (the item in position 5) was moved to position 2. Multiple queue operations are applied at the same time, however; e.g., given the queue of items:

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<!-- MATH
 $Item1 \ Item2 \ Item3 \ Item4 \ Item5 \ Item6 \ Item7 \ Item8$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Item</I>1&nbsp;<I>Item</I>2&nbsp;<I>Item</I>3&nbsp;<I>Item</I>4&nbsp;<I>Item</I>5&nbsp;<I>Item</I>6&nbsp;<I>Item</I>7&nbsp;<I>Item</I>8</SPAN>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
If the following queue operations were applied:

<P>

<P>
<BR>
2 to 6; 6 to 3; 4 to 5; 5 to 2; 7 to 4; 8 to 1

<P>

<P>
<BR>
then the resulting queue would be:

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<!-- MATH
 $Item8 \ Item5 \ Item6 \ Item7 \ Item4 \ Item2 \ Item1 \ Item3$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Item</I>8&nbsp;<I>Item</I>5&nbsp;<I>Item</I>6&nbsp;<I>Item</I>7&nbsp;<I>Item</I>4&nbsp;<I>Item</I>2&nbsp;<I>Item</I>1&nbsp;<I>Item</I>3</SPAN>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
As you can see, the queue operations are strictly enforced, with other items (not involved in queue operations) maintaining their order and moving to vacant positions in the queue. Note that no two queue operations will have the same <SPAN  CLASS="textit">starting-position</SPAN> or same <SPAN  CLASS="textit">requested-position</SPAN> defined.

<P><SPAN CLASS="textit">Core Wars</SPAN> is a game in which two opposing warrior programs attempt to destroy each other in the memory of a virtual machine. They do this by overwriting each other's instructions, and the first program to execute an illegal instruction is declared the loser. Each program is written in an assembly-like language called <SPAN CLASS="textbf">Redcode</SPAN>, and the virtual machine which executes the two programs is known as the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">Memory Array Redcode Simulator</SPAN> (MARS). Your goal is to write a MARS that will read in two Redcode programs, simulate them, and print out which program was the winner.<P>MARS simulates a somewhat unusual environment compared to other virtual machines and processor architectures. The following list describes these differences in detail:<P><OL><LI>MARS simulates a machine with 8000 memory locations and each location stores exactly one Redcode instruction. In fact, a memory location can only store instructions and cannot directly store any data. However, each instruction includes two numeric operands, and these in turn can be manipulated by other instructions for data storage. This also makes self-modifying code possible. </LI><LI>The memory locations are arranged as a continuous array with the first location having address 0 and the last having 7999. All address calculations are performed using modulo 8000 arithmetic. Put in another way, memory addresses wrap around so that addresses 8000, 8001, and 8002 refer to same memory locations respectively as addresses 0, 1, and 2. This also works for negative numbers. For example, -7481, -15481, 519, and 8519 all refer to the same memory location. </LI><LI>All arithmetic and comparison operations are performed modulo 8000. Additions must normalize their final result to be in the range of 0 to 7999 (inclusive) before writing that result into memory. This also implies that -124 is considered to be <SPAN CLASS="textit">greater</SPAN> than 511 since after normalization, -124 becomes 7876, and 7876 is greater than 511. </LI><LI>The simulator maintains two separate instruction pointers (IPs) that store the address of the next instruction to be executed by the warrior programs. After loading both programs into memory, these IPs are initialized to the first instruction of each program. As the programs run, the IP is incremented by one (modulo 8000) after each instruction is executed. If a jump/skip instruction is executed, then the IP is instead loaded with the destination address of the jump/skip and execution continues from this new address. </LI><LI>The simulator ``time slices" between warriors by executing one instruction at a time, and alternating between programs after each instruction. For example, if the two programs were loaded at addresses 2492 and 6140, the first six instructions would be executed in this order (assuming no jump/skip instruction were executed): 2492, 6140, 2493, 6141, 2494, 6142. </LI></OL><P>Every instruction in MARS consists of an opcode, written as a three letter mnemonic, and two operands called the A and B fields. Each operand is a number in the range 0-7999 (inclusive) and each can use one of three addressing modes: immediate, direct, and indirect. These modes are explained in more detail below:<P><UL><LI>Immediate operands are written with a ``<TT>#</TT>" sign in front, as in <TT>#1234</TT>. An immediate operand specifies a literal value for the instruction to operate on. For example, the first operand (i.e. the A field) of an ADD instruction (which performs integer addition) can be an immediate. In that case, the literal value specified by the first operand provides one of the numbers being added. </LI><LI>Direct operands identify the memory locations which an instruction is to access. They are written with a ``<SPAN CLASS="MATH">$</SPAN>" sign in front, as in $1234. One example would be <TT>ADD #5 $3</TT>. A direct operand is actually an offset relative to the current IP address. For example, if the <TT>ADD #5 $3</TT> instruction were stored in memory location 4357, it would actually be adding together a literal number five with a second value stored in the B field of location 4360 (4357 + 3). However, if that same instruction were stored at location 132 it would be adding five to a value in the B field of location 135 (132 + 3). </LI><LI>Indirect operands are analogous to how pointers in some programming languages work. Indirect operands are written with a ``" sign in front of the number, as in <TT>ADD #5 3</TT>. Like before, the indirect operand is an offset relative to the current IP address, and therefore identifies a particular memory location. However, the value stored in the B field of this memory location is then used as an offset relative to <SPAN CLASS="textit">that</SPAN> location to <SPAN CLASS="textit">identify</SPAN> a second location. It is the B field of this second location which will actually be operated on by the instruction itself. For example, if location 4357 contained <TT>ADD 1 3</TT>, location 4358 contained 11 in its B field, and location 4360 contained 7996 in its B field, then this instruction would actually be adding the values stored in locations 4369 (4358 + 11) and 4356 (4360 + 7996 modulo 8000). </LI></UL><P>The list below explains what each instruction does based on its opcode. Although not all instructions use both of their operands, these must still be specified since other instructions might use these operands for data storage. <SPAN CLASS="textbf">Some instructions update the B field of another instruction; this only affects the numerical value of the field, but does <SPAN CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> change its addressing mode.</SPAN><P><DL COMPACT><DT><TT>DAT</TT></DT><DD>This instruction has two purposes. First, it can be used as a generic placeholder for arbitrary data. Second, attempting to execute this instruction terminates the simulation and the program which tried to execute it loses the match. This is the only way that a program can terminate, therefore each warrior attempts to overwrite the other one's program with <TT>DAT</TT> instructions. Both A and B operands must be immediate.</DD><DT><TT>MOV</TT></DT><DD>If the A operand is immediate, the value of this operand is copied into the B field of the instruction specified by <TT>MOV</TT>'s B operand. If neither operand is immediate, the entire instruction (including all field values and addressing modes) at location A is copied to location B. The B operand cannot be immediate.</DD><DT><TT>ADD</TT></DT><DD>If the A operand is immediate, its value is added to the value of the B field of the instruction specified by <TT>ADD</TT>'s B operand, and the final result is stored into the B field of that same instruction. If neither operand is immediate, then they both specify the locations of two instructions in memory. In this case, the A and B fields of one instruction are respectively added to the A and B fields of the second instruction, and both results are respectively written to the A and B fields of the instruction specified by the ADD's B operand. The B operand cannot be immediate.</DD><DT><TT>JMP</TT></DT><DD>Jump to the address specified by the A operand. In other words, the instruction pointer is loaded with a new address (instead of being incremented), and the next instruction executed after the <TT>JMP</TT> will be from the memory location specified by A. The A operand cannot be immediate. The B operand must be immediate, but is not used by this instruction.</DD><DT><TT>JMZ</TT></DT><DD>If the B field of the instruction specified by <TT>JMZ</TT>'s B operand is zero, then jump to the address specified by the A operand. Neither the A nor B operand can be immediate.</DD><DT><TT>SLT</TT></DT><DD>If A is an immediate operand, its value is compared with the value in the B field of the instruction specified by <TT>SLT</TT>'s B operand.

The cornfield maze is a popular Halloween treat. Visitors are shown the entrance and must wander through the maze facing zombies, chainsaw-wielding psychopaths, hippies, and other terrors on their quest to find the exit. 

<P>
One popular maze-walking strategy guarantees that the visitor will eventually find the exit. Simply choose either the right or left wall, and follow it. Of course, there's no guarantee which strategy (left or right) will be better, and the path taken is seldom the most efficient. (It also doesn't work on mazes with exits that are not on the edge; those types of mazes are not represented in this problem.) 

<P>
As the proprieter of a cornfield that is about to be converted into a maze, you'd like to have a computer program that can determine the left and right-hand paths along with the shortest path so that you can figure out which layout has the best chance of confounding visitors.

You are the lead programmer for the Securitron 9042, the latest and greatest in home security software from Jellern Inc. (Motto: We secure your stuff so YOU can't even get to it). The software is designed to ``secure" a room; it does this by determining the minimum number of locks it has to perform to prevent access to a given room from one or more other rooms. Each door connects two rooms and has a single control panel that will unlock it. This control panel is accessible from only one side of the door. So, for example, if the layout of a house looked like this:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

</DIV>
with rooms numbered 0-6 and control panels marked with the letters ``CP" (each next to the door it can unlock and in the room that it is accessible from), then one could say that the minimum number of locks to perform to secure room <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">2</SPAN> from room <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">1</SPAN> is two; one has to lock the door between room <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">2</SPAN> and room <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">1</SPAN> <SPAN  CLASS="textit">and</SPAN> the door between room <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">3</SPAN> and room <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">1</SPAN>.

Bill just realized that the sudoku puzzle he had spent the last ten minutes trying to solve essentially was last week's puzzle, only rotated counterclockwise. How cheap! Couldn't the magazine afford to make a new one every week? Of course, he had no way of knowing about this before he started to solve it, as the holes to fill with digits were other than last week. Nevertheless, realizing that this week's puzzle was a simple derivative of last week's certainly took the fun out of solving the rest of it.<p><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/36/p3633.png> The sudoku board consists of 9&times;9 cells. These can be grouped into 3&times;3 <em>regions</em> of 3&times;3 cells each. Some of the cells are filled with a digit 1 through 9 while the rest of them are left empty. The aim of the game is to fill each empty cell with a digit 1...9 so that every row, every column and every region contains each of the numbers 1...9 exactly once. A proper sudoku puzzle always has exactly one solution.<p>Help Bill avoid unpleasant surprises by creating a program that checks whether an unsolved sudoku puzzle is in fact derived from an earlier puzzle by simple operations.<p>The allowed operations are:<ul><li>Rotating the entire puzzle clockwise or counterclockwise. <li>Swapping two columns within a 3&times;9 column segment. <li>Swapping two rows within a 9&times;3 row segment. <li>Swapping entire row or column segments. <li>Applying a permutation <em>f</em> of the digits 1...9 to every cell (i.e. replace <em>x</em> by <em>f(x)</em> in every cell).</ul><p>An operation is considered being performed on the sudoku solution (rather than on the unsolved puzzle) and always guarantees that if the board before the transformation was a solution to a sudoku puzzle, it still is afterwards.<h2>Input</h2><p>The input starts with the number of test cases 0 &le; <em>N</em> &le; 50 on a single line.<p>Then for every test case follow nine lines describing last week's puzzle solution, from top to bottom. Each line corresponds to a row in the puzzle and consists of nine digits (1...9), describing the contents of the cell from left to right.<p>Last week's solution is followed by nine lines describing this week's unsolved puzzle. Here, also, every line corresponds to a puzzle row and every digit (0...9) describes the contents of a cell. 0 indicates that the cell is empty. The rows are presented ordered from top to bottom, and within each row, the cells are ordered from left to right.<p>After every test case except the last one follows a blank line. Every unsolved puzzle is guaranteed to be uniquely solvable and last week's solution is always a proper sudoku solution.<h2>Output</h2>For every test case, output <tt>Yes</tt> if the sudoku puzzle can be derived from the given solved puzzle using the allowed operations, or <tt>No</tt> if this is not possible.<div class="sample"><h2>Sample Input</h2><pre>

Initially controversial, set theory has come to play the role of a foundational theory in modern mathematics, in the sense of a theory invoked to justify assumptions made in mathematics concerning the existence of mathematical objects (such as numbers or functions) and their properties. Formal versions of set theory also have a foundational role to play as specifying a theoretical ideal of mathematical rigor in proofs.</q><p>Given this importance of sets, being the basis of mathematics, a set of eccentric theorist set off to construct a supercomputer operating on sets instead of numbers. The initial SetStack Alpha is under construction, and they need you to simulate it in order to verify the operation of the prototype.<p>The computer operates on a single stack of sets, which is initially empty. After each operation, the cardinality of the topmost set on the stack is output. The cardinality of a set <em>S</em> is denoted |<em>S</em>| and is the number of elements in <em>S</em>. The instruction set of the SetStack Alpha is <tt>PUSH</tt>, <tt>DUP</tt>, <tt>UNION</tt>, <tt>INTERSECT</tt>, and <tt>ADD</tt>}.<ul><li><tt>PUSH</tt> will push the empty set {} on the stack. <li><tt>DUP</tt> will duplicate the topmost set (pop the stack, and then push that set on the stack twice). <li><tt>UNION</tt> will pop the stack twice and then push the union of the two sets on the stack. <li><tt>INTERSECT</tt> will pop the stack twice and then push the intersection of the two sets on the stack. <li><tt>ADD</tt> will pop the stack twice, add the first set to the second one, and then push the resulting set on the stack.</ul><p>For illustration purposes, assume that the topmost element of the stack is<p><em>A</em> = { {}, {{}} },<p>and that the next one is<p><em>B</em> = { {}, {{{}}} }.<p>For these sets, we have |<em>A</em>| = 2 and |<em>B</em>| = 2. Then:<ul><li><tt>UNION</tt> would result in the set { {}, {{}}, {{{}}} }. The output is 3. <li><tt>INTERSECT</tt> would result in the set { {} }. The output is 1. <li><tt>ADD</tt> would result in the set { {}, {{{}}}, {{},{{}}} }. The output is 3.</ul><h2>Input</h2><p>An integer 0 &le; <em>T</em> &le; 5 on the first line gives the cardinality of the set of test cases. The first line of each test case contains the number of operations 0 &le; <em>N</em> &le; 2000. Then follow <em>N</em> lines each containing one of the five commands. It is guaranteed that the SetStack computer can execute all the commands in the sequence without ever popping an empty stack.<h2>Output</h2><p>For each operation specified in the input, there will be one line of output consisting of a single integer. This integer is the cardinality of the topmost element of the stack after the corresponding command has executed. After each test case there will be a line with <tt>***</tt> (three asterisks).<div class="sample"><h2>Sample Input</h2><pre>

Not just one pie, no, I have a number <em>N</em> of them, of various tastes and of various sizes. <em>F</em> of my friends are coming to my party and each of them gets a piece of pie. This should be one piece of one pie, not several small pieces since that looks messy. This piece can be one whole pie though.<p>My friends are very annoying and if one of them gets a bigger piece than the others, they start complaining. Therefore all of them should get equally sized (but not necessarily equally shaped) pieces, even if this leads to some pie getting spoiled (which is better than spoiling the party). Of course, I want a piece of pie for myself too, and that piece should also be of the same size.<p>What is the largest possible piece size all of us can get? All the pies are cylindrical in shape and they all have the same height 1, but the radii of the pies can be different.<h2>Input</h2><p>One line with a positive integer: the number of test cases.

The goal of the game is to set up train lines (and to thwart the opponents' attempts at setting up their train lines). At the beginning of play, each player is assigned four train lines. A player may choose to discard as many of these four assignments as she likes. Each assignment has a score, corresponding to its difficulty (so, typically, a train line between e.g. Stockholm and Tokyo would be worth more than a train line between e.g. Stockholm and Utrecht). At the end of the game, each player gets points for the assignments that they have successfully completed, and penalty points for the assignments that they have failed to complete.<p>An assignment consists of a pair of cities that are to be connected by a series of shorter railway routes. A route can be claimed (for a certain cost associated with the route), but things are complicated by the fact that there is only a limited number of routes, and once a player claims a route, none of the other players can claim it. A player has successfully set up a train line between two cities if there is a path between the two cities using only routes that have been claimed by this player. For simplicity, we will ignore all additional aspects of the game (including the actual process of claiming routes and additional ways to score points).<p>For instance, if your assignment is to connect Stockholm and Amsterdam in the Figure above, you would probably want to claim the routes between Stockholm and Copenhagen, and between Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But if another player manages to claim the route between Copenhagen and Stockholm before you, your train line would have to use some other routes, e.g. by going to Copenhagen via Oslo.<p>In this problem, we will consider the rather bold strategy of trying to complete all four assignments (typically, this will be quite hard). As a preliminary assessment of the difficulty of achieving this, we would like to calculate the minimum cost of setting up all four lines assuming that none of the other players interfere with our plans. Your job is to write a program to determine this minimum cost.<h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of several (at most 20) games to be analyzed. Each game starts with two integers 1 &le; <em>n</em> &le; 30, 0 &le; <em>m</em> &le; 1000, giving the number of cities and railway routes in the map, respectively. Then follow <em>n</em> lines, giving the names of the <em>n</em> cities. City names are at most 20 characters long and consist solely of lower case letters (<tt>'a'-'z'</tt>).<p>After this follow <em>m</em> lines, each containing the names of two different cities and an integer 1 &le; <em>c</em> &le; 10000, indicating that there is a railway route with cost <em>c</em> between the two cities. Note that there may be several railway routes between the same pair of cities. You may assume that it is always possible to set up a train line from any city to any other city.<p>Finally, there will be four lines, each containing the names of two cities, giving the four train line assignments.<p>The input is terminated by a case where <em>n</em> = <em>m</em> = 0. This case should not be processed.<h2>Output</h2>For each game, output a single line containing a single integer, the minimum possible cost to set up all four train lines.<div class="sample"><h2>Sample Input</h2><pre>

He had better build a new one, this time large enough to hold all of his books. Tom finds it practical to have the books close at hand when he works at his desk. Therefore, he is imagining a compact solution with the bookcase standing on the back of the desk. Obviously, this would put some restrictions on the size of the bookcase, it should preferably be as small as possible. In addition, Tom would like the bookcase to have exactly three shelves for aesthetical reasons.<p>Wondering how small his bookcase could be, he models the problem as follows. He measures the height <em>h<sub>i</sub></em> and thickness <em>t<sub>i</sub></em> of each book <em>i</em> and he seeks a partition of the books in three non-empty sets <em>S<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>S<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>S<sub>3</sub></em> such that<p><img class="figure" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/36/p3637a.jpg><p>is minimized, i.e. the area of the bookcase as seen when standing in front of it (the depth needed is obviously the largest width of all his books, regardless of the partition). Note that this formula does not give the exact area of the bookcase, since the actual shelves cause a small additional height, and the sides cause a small additional width. For simplicity, we will ignore this small discrepancy.<p>Thinking a moment on the problem, Tom realizes he will need a computer program to do the job.<h2>Input</h2><p>The input begins with a positive number on a line of its own telling the number of test cases (at most 20). For each test case there is one line containing a single positive integer <em>N</em>, 3 &le; <em>N</em> &le; 70 giving the number of books. Then <em>N</em> lines follow each containing two positive integers <em>h<sub>i</sub></em>, <em>t<sub>i</sub></em>, satisfying 150 &le; <em>h<sub>i</sub></em> &le; 300 and 5 &le; <em>t<sub>i</sub></em> &le; 30, the height and thickness of book <em>i</em> respectively, in millimeters.<h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, output one line containing the minimum area (height times width) of a three-shelf bookcase capable of holding all the books, expressed in square millimeters.<div class="sample"><h2>Sample Input</h2><pre>

Sometimes there are a hundred jobs in the printer queue and you may have to wait for hours to get a single page of output.<p>Because some jobs are more important than others, the Hacker General has invented and implemented a simple priority system for the print job queue. Now, each job is assigned a priority between 1 and 9 (with 9 being the highest priority, and 1 being the lowest), and the printer operates as follows.<ul><li>The first job <em>J</em> in queue is taken from the queue. <li>If there is some job in the queue with a higher priority than job <em>J</em>, then move <em>J</em> to the end of the queue without printing it. <li>Otherwise, print job <em>J</em> (and do not put it back in the queue).</ul><p>In this way, all those important muffin recipes that the Hacker General is printing get printed very quickly. Of course, those annoying term papers that others are printing may have to wait for quite some time to get printed, but that's life.<p>Your problem with the new policy is that it has become quite tricky to determine when your print job will actually be completed. You decide to write a program to figure this out. The program will be given the current queue (as a list of priorities) as well as the position of your job in the queue, and must then calculate how long it will take until your job is printed, assuming that no additional jobs will be added to the queue. To simplify matters, we assume that printing a job always takes exactly one minute, and that adding and removing jobs from the queue is instantaneous.<h2>Input</h2>One line with a positive integer: the number of test cases (at most 100). Then for each test case:<ul><li>One line with two integers <em>n</em> and <em>m</em>, where <em>n</em> is the number of jobs in the queue (1 &le; <em>n</em> &le; 100) and <em>m</em> is the position of your job (0 &le; m &le; n-1). The first position in the queue is number 0, the second is number 1, and so on. <li>One line with <em>n</em> integers in the range 1 to 9, giving the priorities of the jobs in the queue. The first integer gives the priority of the first job, the second integer the priority of the second job, and so on.</ul><h2>Output</h2>For each test case, print one line with a single integer; the number of minutes until your job is completely printed, assuming that no additional print jobs will arrive.<div class="sample"><h2>Sample Input</h2><pre>

I am the Prime minister, you know!<br>&mdash; I know, so therefore your new number 8179 is also a prime. You will just have to paste four new digits over the four old ones on your office door.<br>&mdash; No, it's not that simple. Suppose that I change the first digit to an 8, then the number will read 8033 which is not a prime!<br>&mdash; I see, being the prime minister you cannot stand having a non-prime number on your door even for a few seconds.<br>&mdash; Correct! So I must invent a scheme for going from 1033 to 8179 by a path of prime numbers where only one digit is changed from one prime to the next prime.<p>Now, the minister of finance, who had been eavesdropping, intervened.<br>&mdash; No unnecessary expenditure, please! I happen to know that the price of a digit is one pound.<br>&mdash; Hmm, in that case I need a computer program to minimize the cost. You don't know some very cheap software gurus, do you?<br>&mdash; In fact, I do.

As the name suggests, it's shape (as seen from above) is just a straight line, rather than some two-dimensional shape. The landscape along this line is very mountainous, something which occasionally leads to some problems. One such problem now occurs: in this modern era the king wants to build an airport to stimulate the country's economy. Unfortunately, it's impossible for airplanes to land on steep airstrips, so a horizontal piece of land is needed. To accommodate for the larger airplanes, this strip needs to have length at least <em>L</em>.<p>Over the years, the inhabitants of Lineland have become very proficient in flattening pieces of land. Given a piece a land, they can remove rock quickly. They don't want to add rock for that may lead to an unstable landing strip. To minimize the amount of effort, however, they want to remove the least amount of rock necessary to reach their goal: a flat piece of land of length <em>L</em>. What is this minimum amount? Because of the low-dimensional nature of Lineland, the amount of rock that needs to be removed is measured as the total area of land above the place where the landing strip is placed, rather than the volume (so in the Figure below, the amount of land removed is given by the lightly shaded area).<p><img class="figure" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/36/p3640.png><h2>Input</h2><p>One line with a positive number: the number of test cases (at most 25).

Let us see...<br>To their disappointment, they soon saw that this could not be the substitution that was used in the book. Suddenly, Stan brightened.<br>&mdash; Maybe Leonardo really wrote the substitution alphabet on the last page, and by mistake his assistant coded that line as he had coded the rest of the book. So the line we have here is the result of applying some permutation TWICE to the ordinary alphabet!<br>Sarah took out her laptop computer and coded fiercely for a few minutes. Then she turned to Stan with a sympathetic expression.<br>&mdash; No, that couldn't be it. I am afraid that you have been duped again, my friend.

This study has concluded that the only reason for this lack of support is the difficulty in organizing the travel arrangements. To help solving this problem, the administration has asked you to build a program that computes the maximum number of people that can fly from a departure city to a destination city, using the available places in regular flights in a given day, and arriving at or before a given time. When traveling from one city to another, a person may make multiple transfers. Each transfer is, at least, 30 minutes long, i.e., the departure time should be, at least 30 minutes after the arrival time. Given a set of flights for a single day and the latest arrival time, your program should compute the maximum number of persons that can fly, directly or indirectly, from a departure city to a destination city, arriving at or before the latest arrival time.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

Moreover, if a trap gets triggered, its cell becomes blocked, and cannot be used anymore in a path. To make things worse, they have discovered that traps may have effects at a distance on other traps: if one triggers a trap, then traps associated to it also become triggered.

The second line contains two integers that indicate the width (<i>w</i></span><span lang=EN-GB>) and height (<i>h</i></span><span lang=EN-GB>) of the map, where <i>h</i></span><span lang=EN-GB>&times;<i>w</i></span><span lang=EN-GB> do not exceed 40000. The following <i>h</i></span><span lang=EN-GB> lines of the input contain <i>w</i></span><span lang=EN-GB> symbols that define the cells of the map (separated by an empty space). The following codes are used: '</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Courier'>x</span><span lang=EN-GB>' represents a cell with solid wall, a symbol </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Symbol'><i>alpha</i></span><span lang=EN-GB> from '</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Courier'>A</span><span lang=EN-GB>' to '</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Courier'>Z</span><span lang=EN-GB>' identifies a cell containing a trap of kind </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Symbol'><i>alpha</i></span><span lang=EN-GB>, and '</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Courier'>o</span><span lang=EN-GB>' represents an empty cell. The two last lines define the coordinates of the start and end positions, with two integers for the <i>x</i></span><span lang=EN-GB> (column) and <i>y</i></span><span lang=EN-GB> (line) coordinates in the grid, starting from 0. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:

Frequently, ambulance drivers have to shout orders asking drivers to remove cars from a certain lane in the street,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>a special lane reserved for emergency vehicles, the "Fire Lane". <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>To model the situation, we consider an imaginary grid representing the street.

Your objective is to compute the necessary orders to clear the Fire Lane of those blocking vehicles so that the ambulance can pass through.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>The Fire Lane consists of two distinguished consecutive columns in the grid.

<P>Some people are against lotteries on moral grounds, some governments forbid lotteries, but with the advent of Internet this popular form of gambling, which started in China and helped finance the Great Wall, is thriving.<P>But the odds of winning a national lottery are tiny, and therefore your college classmates decided to organize a private lottery, with draws every Friday. The lottery is based on a popular style: a student who wants to bet chooses <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> distinct numbers from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN> and pays US$ 1.00 (notice that traditional lotteries such as US National Lotto use <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I> = 6</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I> = 49</SPAN>). On Friday during lunch <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> numbers (also from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>) are drawn. The student whose bet has the largest number of correct guesses receives the amount collected in the bets. This amount is shared in case of ties and accumulates to next week if no one guessed any of the numbers drawn.<P>Some of your colleagues do not believe in the laws of probability and asked you to write a program that determines the numbers that have been drawn the fewest times considering all previous draws, so that they can bet on those numbers.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several test cases.

<P>Mr. Frog lives in a grid-like marsh of rectangular shape, composed of equally-sized cells, some of which are dry, some of which are only watery places. Mr. Frog lives in a dry cell and can jump only from a dry cell to another dry cell on his wanderings around the marsh.<P>Mr. Frog wants to visit his girlfriend, Ms. Toad, who also lives in a dry cell in the same marsh. But Mr. Frog is lazy, and wants to spend the minimum amount of energy in his jumping way to Ms. Toad's home. Mr. Frog knows how much energy he spends in any of his jumps. For any single jump, Mr. Frog always uses the following figure to determine which are the possible target cells from his current position (the cell marked <SPAN CLASS="textbf">F</SPAN>), and the corresponding energy spent in the jump, in calories.

<P>The ICPC judges are preparing a party for the opening ceremony. For the party, they intend to add a playlist with some songs to the jukebox software (a simple MP3 player). However, there are so many songs in the computer that it is diffcult to find the ones they want to add. As a consequence, they need to use the search feature many times.<P>In this jukebox, when you search for a string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>, the software returns every music whose title or artist name contains <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> as a substring. String <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> is a substring of string <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I></SPAN> if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I></SPAN> contains all characters of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN> as a contiguous sequence (for example, `bc' is a substring of `abcd', but `ac' is not). To save their precious time, while looking for a song, they always use one of the song's <SPAN CLASS="textit">golden string</SPAN>, i.e. one of the shortest strings for which the search returns as a result only the song they want.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="971" HEIGHT="407" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/36/p3653a.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p3653a.eps}"></DIV><P>In the example above, a possible golden string for the song `johnnatan' is `ta'. Note that `ta' is not a substring of the name of another song nor a substring of the artist of another song. Note also that there is no string of size equal to 1 that could identify uniquely the song `johnnatan'.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="971" HEIGHT="422" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/36/p3653a.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p3653b.eps}"></DIV><P>They discovered that if they remove the artist fields from some of the songs they can get even smaller golden strings. For the song `john', there is no golden string. However, if one removes the artist field from all other songs, the string `c' becomes the golden string for the song `john'.<P>Given the song list (each song with name and artist), your job is to determine the minimum sum of the golden string sizes for all songs that can be obtained if one is allowed to remove some of the artist fields. In the figure above you can see a possible best result with the golden strings in bold. The minimum sum of the golden string sizes in this case is 10.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several test cases.

<P>Dr. Kabal, a well recognized biologist, has recently discovered a liquid that is capable of curing the most advanced diseases. The liquid is extracted from a very rare onion that can be found in a country called Onionland. But not all onions of Onionland are worth to take to the lab for processing. Only those onions with an odd number of layers contain the miraculous liquid. Quite an odd discovery!<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="562" HEIGHT="217" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/36/p3655a.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p3655a.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1: Onion from Onionland</DIV><P>Dr. Kabal has hired a lot of research assistants to collect and analyse onions for him. Since he does not want to share his discovery with the world yet, he didn't tell the assistants to look for onions with an odd number of layers. Instead, each assistant was given the task of collecting onions, and selecting points from each of the layer's outer borders, so that an approximation of the layer structure of the onion can be reconstructed later. Dr. Kabal told the assistants that the next step will be a ``complicated analysis'' of these points. In fact, all he will do is simply to use the points to count the number of layers in each of the onions, and select the ones with an odd number of layers.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="575" HEIGHT="230" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/36/p3655a.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p3655b.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 2: Points collected by an assistant</DIV><P>It is clear that the approximation obtained by Dr. Kabal, from the points collected, might have a different <SPAN CLASS="textit">shape</SPAN> than the original onion. For instance, only some of the points of the onion shown in Figure 1 would be extracted in the process, giving rise to a set of points as shown in Figure 2. With these points Dr. Kabal will try to approximate the original layers of the onion, obtaining something like what is shown in Figure 3. The approximation procedure followed by Dr. Kabal (whose result is shown in Figure 3) is simply to recursively find nested convex polygons such that at the end every point belongs to precisely one of the polygons. The assistants have been told to select points in such a way that the number <SPAN CLASS="textit">of layers in the approximation, if done in this recursive manner, will be the same as in the original onion</SPAN>, so that is fine with Dr. Kabal. The assistants are also aware that they need at least three points to approximate a layer, even the innermost one.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="575" HEIGHT="243" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/36/p3655a.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p3655c.eps}"></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 3: Dr. Kabal's approximation</DIV><P>Your task is to write a program that, given a set of points collected by an assistant (as shown in Figure 2), determines if the respective onion should be taken to the laboratory.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several test cases.

<P>There are several versions of Odd or Even, a game played by competitors to decide random issues (such as ``who will code this problem?"). In one of the versions, for two players, the game starts with each player calling either odds or evens. Then they count to three (some people chant ``Once, twice, three, SHOOT!"). On three, both players hold out one of their hands, showing a number of fingers (from zero to five). If the fingers add to an even number, then the person who called evens wins. If the fingers add to an odd number, then the person who called odds wins.<P>John and Mary played several games of Odd or Even. In every game John chose odds (and, consequently, Mary chose evens). During the games each player wrote down, in small cards, how many fingers he/she showed, using one card for each game - Mary used blue cards, John used red cards.

<P>Demand for electricity grew rapidly in the country over recent years, and is projected to grow even faster in the next twenty years. To cope with this increase in demand, the government is planning to privatize the country's electricity power-generation sector, ending the monopoly of the state-owned company, ICPC (Independent Circuit Power Corporation).<P>ICPC owns a set of power-generation plants (hydroelectric and nuclear). ICPC's plants are connected by <SPAN CLASS="textit">power lines</SPAN> that cross the country. Each power line connects two distinct power plants and is constructed in a straight line. A <SPAN CLASS="textit">power path</SPAN> is a sequence of power lines <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>l</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>l</I><SUB>2</SUB>,..., <I>l</I><SUB>m</SUB></SPAN>, with each power line <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>l</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> connecting directly plants <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>i-1</SUB></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> , such that any two consecutive power lines <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>l</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>l</I><SUB>i+1</SUB></SPAN> are linked to a common power plant <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>.<P>Power plants were built over several years, one at a time, due to budget restrictions. Also due to budget restrictions, every time a new power plant was built, only one new power line was constructed to integrate the new plant to the existing ICPC system. The new power line always linked the newly built power plant to the nearest power plant already in the system. If more than one such plant existed (that is, if more than one plant was located at a minimum distance from the new plant), the oldest plant was chosen.<P>In the privatization project, the aim is to break up the ICPC power-generation system into smaller companies, each company owning a set of power plants (each power plant will be owned by only one company). After the privatization, ICPC will cease to exist; only the new companies will own the power plants. The division of power plants among new companies must obey the following restrictions:<P><UL><LI>the <SPAN CLASS="textit">total capacity</SPAN> of every new company must be at least <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> is a value in MW (Mega Watts) decided by the government. The total capacity of a set of power plants is the sum of capacities of those plants; </LI><LI>power paths between any two plants owned by a new company must include only plants owned by that company.

<P>At the end of the week, John asked Mary to send him an urgent sales report. Mary was in a hurry because she was leaving for her holiday. She then copy-pasted the sales sheet on an email, sent it to John and went out. She did not want to be annoyed with work issues, so she left without telling anyone where she would be. She announced that she would be simply not available for the next two weeks, turned off her cell phone, and left.<P>When John received the message he realized that the report had no spaces at all! He knew that the report should have a header line with product codes of the form <TT>P1</TT>, <TT>P2</TT>, ..., <TT>P<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUB>N</SUB></SPAN></TT> and the word <TT>Totals</TT> at the end. Then there would be several lines reporting product sales for the different sellers of Mary's office. Each seller was identified with a name composed by one word (only alphabetical characters). The line corresponding to a seller should begin with his/her name, followed by the number of sold products, according to the columns' report. The last line of the report should begin with the two letters <TT>TP</TT> followed by the totals of each column in the report (of course, no seller's name began with the letters <TT>TP</TT>). John knew that there were no negative numbers in the report, a zero quantity was reported with a single <TT>0</TT>, and there were no leading zeros when reporting a positive quantity.<P>At this point, John decided to reconstruct Mary's report. He knew that there could be more than one possible result, but he wanted to do it anyway with the first consistent solution that he could find (maybe he could fix any mistakes when Mary comes back).<P>Could you help John with the recovering of Mary's sales report?<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of several test cases.

<P>Turkish Roulette is a betting game that uses a roulette with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I></SPAN> slots, each one numbered with an integer between -64 and 64. In each turn of the game players bet on B balls, each one also numbered from -64 to 64. For each of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> balls, exactly one player will bet on it.<P>After spinning the roulette, the dealer throws in the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> balls sequentially. When the roulette stops, each ball is lodged <SPAN CLASS="textit">over</SPAN> two (adjacent) slots, as depicted in the figure below, which shows a roulette with thirty two slots and four balls. Notice that, as the figure illustrates, a ball occupies the space of two adjacent slots, and therefore there is room for at most <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/36/3659img1.png ALT="$ \lfloor$"><I>S</I>/2<IMG WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/36/3659img1.png ALT="$ \rfloor$"></SPAN> balls in the roulette.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="484" HEIGHT="486" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/36/3659img1.png ALT="\epsfbox{p3659.eps}"></DIV><P>Balls end up lodged in the same relative positions that they were thrown in the roulette. That is, if balls <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN> are thrown in that sequence, they end up lodged such that, in clockwise direction, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN> is followed by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN> which is followed by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN> which is followed by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN>.<P>The <SPAN CLASS="textit">value</SPAN> of a ball in a turn is calculated by multiplying the ball's number by the sum of the numbers of the two adjacent slots over which the ball is lodged. If a ball's value is positive, the player who bet on that ball receives that amount (the ball's value) from the dealer; if a ball's value is negative, the player who bet on that ball must pay that amount to the dealer. The <SPAN CLASS="textit">profit</SPAN> of the dealer in a turn is the total amount received minus the total amount paid.<P>For example, in the figure above, the dealer pays $5.00 for ball numbered -1, pays $7.00 for ball numbered -7, receives $24.00 for ball numbered 12 and does not pay nor receive anything for ball numbered 3. Therefore, in this turn the dealer makes a profit of $12.00 <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(24 - 5 - 7)</SPAN>; note that the dealer's profit in a turn may be negative (loss).<P>You will be given the description of the roulette, the description of the balls and the sequence in which the balls are thrown into the roulette.

<P>``Connect it" is a popular game for all ages. Newman loves the game very much. ``Connect it" has a stronger version with slightly different rules.<P>The game venue is expressed by size. When the game starts, there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>size</I> <TT>x</TT> 2<I>size</I></SPAN> diamonds, each diamond is a square whose side length is <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1</SPAN> with different patterns on it. The diamonds form a Big Square whose side length is <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>size</I></SPAN>. Each time, a player can choose two diamonds with the same patterns. If exists a broken line which can connect the center point of two diamonds with one turning at most and which doesn't go through any other diamond, these two diamonds will be eliminated at the same time. Such a broken line is called ``valid broken line". Players continue to eliminate diamonds until all diamonds are eliminated or no diamonds can be eliminated.<P>To enhance visual effect, we set a boundary for game venue. The boundary is a circle whose center is the center of the Big Square and whose radius is <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>size</I></SPAN>. Any part of the broken line cannot go beyond the circle, but can be in (or on) the circle.<P>Newman's task is to complete a part of the game, i.e. for a given middle status or start status in the game, determine whether two diamonds can be connected by a ``valid broken line". Suppose the two diamonds have the same patterns, Newman hopes you can help him.<P>Here are two examples of valid broken line:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="65"></A><TABLE><CAPTION ALIGN="BOTTOM"><STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG> Two examples of valid broken line.</CAPTION><TR><TD><TABLE WIDTH="50%"><TR><TD><!--DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

XAR lab recently develops a new computer for data compression -
``XAR08".  Each time, XAR08 will get an integer sequence from input,
and output it after compression.

<P>
XAR08 is composed of several <SPAN CLASS="MATH">8</SPAN>-bit binary storage units. Each
storage unit can store an <SPAN CLASS="MATH">8</SPAN>-bit unsigned integer and support <SPAN CLASS="MATH">4</SPAN>
directives. A program in XAR08 is a directive sequence composed of
these <SPAN CLASS="MATH">4</SPAN> directives as follows:

<P>

  Every program should end with this directive.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Each time, XAR08 gets an integer sequence with the length of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
from input. These <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> integers will be stored in the first <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
storage units in order (The number of storage units is enough).
After compression, the value in these <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> storage units will be sent
to output in the same order.

<P>
XAR08's data compression operation is based on a transformation <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>f</I></SPAN>:
Transform the input sequence (all elements are different) <!-- MATH
 $D=(d_0,
d_1, \ldots d_{n-1})$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I> = (<I>d</I><SUB>0</SUB>, <I>d</I><SUB>1</SUB>,...<I>d</I><SUB>n-1</SUB>)</SPAN> to the sequence <!-- MATH
 $(0, 1, \ldots, n-1)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(0, 1,..., <I>n</I> - 1)</SPAN>, i.e.
<!-- MATH
 $f(d_i)=i (0 \leq i < n)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>f</I> (<I>d</I><SUB>i</SUB>) = <I>i</I>(0 <IMG

 ALT="$ \leq$"> <I>i</I> &lt; <I>n</I>)</SPAN>.

<P>
Your task is, for each input sequence, write an XAR08 program
composed of the above four directives to implement the
transformation <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>f</I></SPAN>. XAR08 is still in research stage, so it can only
execute a program with no more than <SPAN CLASS="MATH">40, 000</SPAN> directives.

 $(0 < i < n)$

<P>
We have a paragraph of text to print. A text is a sequence of words and each word consists
of characters. When we print a text, we print the words from the text one at a time, according
to the order the words appear in the text. The words are printed in lines, and we can print at
most <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> characters in a line. If there is space available, we could print more than one word in a
line. However, when we print more than one word in a line, we need to place exactly one space
character between two adjacent words in a line. For example, when we are given a text like the
following: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
<PRE>
This is a text of fourteen words and the longest word has ten characters
</PRE> 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Now we can print this text into lines of no more than 20 characters as the following.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
<PRE>
This is
a text of
fourteen words
and the longest
word has ten characters
</PRE> 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
However, when you print less than 20 characters in a line, you need to pay a penalty, which is
equal to the square of the dierence between 20 and the actual number of characters you printed
in that line. For example in the rst line we actually printed seven characters so the penalty is
<!-- MATH
 $(20 - 7)^{2} = 169$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(20 - 7)<SUP>2</SUP> = 169</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The total penalty is the sum of all penalties from all lines. Given the text and
the number of maximum number of characters allowed in a line, compute the minimum penalty
to print the text.

<P>
Mr. Macdonald is a farmer. He has a huge land to manage. To monitor the number of bugs
in his land, he asks help from the famous professor T. Professor T is an expert on computer
science. 

<P>
Professor T studies several efficient approach and suggests Mr. Macdonald to setup a wireless 
sensor system in his land. The system will be setup as follows:

<P>
In each predened location, one wireless sensor will be established. Since all sensors are
operated by batteries, the powers consumed by the sensors are determined by the eective com-
munication distance (ECD) between sensors. Mr. Macdonald is a nice old man. He prefers not
to trouble professor T much. Therefore, he decides that all sensors will be set in the same power
level. That is, all sensors will have the same eective communication distance.

<P>
The land is so huge that it is not possible to cover all spots by the sensors. However, each
sensor can broadcast the collected data to their neighbors as long as the neighbors are in its
eective communication distance. But the total number of sensors is relative small comparing
to the land. Mr. Macdonald needs to travel the whole land to collect the data from sensors
everyday. 

<P>
Mr. Macdonald is getting old. He hopes that the computer in his house can collect all data
from all sensors automatically. Again, he called professor T for help. This time, professor T
suggests Mr. Macdonald to setup a base station in his house. The house is right in the center
of the land.

<P>
Due to the limited budget, the number of receiver/transmitter Mr. Macdonald can aord
is limited and is relatively small comparing to the total number of sensors. It is impossible
to assign receiver/transmitter to every sensor. Therefore, sensors with no receiver/transmitter
need to send their data to the sensor with receiver/transmitter (directly or indirect) rst, After
that, the sensor with receiver/transmitter sends all data it receives from other sensors along with
the data it collects back to the base station. You may assume that the receiver/transmitter has
enough power such that it always can send data back to the base station.

<P>
Professor T promises to write the necessary software to make all sensors work together in
this way, but one important issue need to be studied. If all sensors are set at the maximum
power level, all sensors might be able to send their data back without troubles, but the battery
will be out-of-power soon. To save power, professor T need to decide the minimum power level
needed such that the battery can have longest operating time while all sensor data can be col-
lected by the base station.

<P>
Although professor T is good in programming, he is weak in algorithm design. Your goal
is to help professor T to write a program to determine the minimum power level needed to set
all sensors accordingly. To simplify our problem, please report the ECD corresponding to the
minimum power level. Please apply the ceiling function to your answer.

<P>
Here is an example:

<P>
Assume that the land is <!-- MATH
 $10 \times 10$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">10&#215;10</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. There are three sensors, located at (1,1), (2,1) and (8,7).
We also assume that there are 2 receiver/transmitters. In this example, the ECD of all sensors
need to be set at 1.

people in ancient time use the same calendar as we do? There are many interesting conjectures
and theories about those problems. Now we will tell you one story that may help explaining
plausible answers to these questions. Using information in the story, you are then ask to solve
an interesting problem using computer. Note that there are many theories about the calendar
system discussed. This problem set will tell only one of them in a simplified way.

<P>
Throughout history, people keep track of time by observing the relative positions of the
earth, the moon and the sun. A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">day</SPAN> is the amount of time the earth completes a self rotation.
An <SPAN  CLASS="textit">year</SPAN> is defined to be the amount of time the earth orbits the sun. The earth takes roughly
365.242190 days to orbit the sun with some small variations. For practical purpose, a calendar
year needs to have an integral number of days. Hence people need to add <SPAN  CLASS="textit">leap</SPAN> days to keep the
calendar synchronized with the sun. If you keep a calendar year to have 365 years, you need to
add one more day in a leap year roughly about every 4 years. However, this kind of calendar will
not be in perfect synchronization with the earth's position orbiting the sun because it advanced
365.25 days in average, which is slightly more than the actual period.

<P>
Depending on how accurate you can measure the period of the earth orbiting the sun, you
need to invent different formulas for leap years. Several famous Western calendar systems have
been invented, not to mention the more complex Oriental systems. In order to save programmers'
eorts, we will not discuss the Oriental, such as Chinese, calendar systems. We will focus on
major Western calendar systems. The earliest one may be the Julian calendar created by Julius
Caesar in 46 BC. It is not accurate enough and will have one day off every 128 years. The next
one is the Astronomical Julian calendar invented by Joseph Justus Scaliger around the 16th
century. Both have simple formulas to determine which year is a leap year.

<P>
The next major one is called Gregorian calendar that was invented at the year 1582 because
the synchronization of the earth's orbiting and the calendar is finally noticed by people. In this
system, a leap year is dropped every 100 years unless it is every 400 years. By doing this
modification, the average number of days in a calendar year is 365.2425. Note that this system
is also not perfect. It adds one more day every 3289 years. There are other more modifications
suggested, such as the one by Astronomer John Herschel, the Greek Orthodox, and the SPAWAR
group in the US Navy. For simplicity, people use Gregorian calendar system though it may not
be perfect. 

<P>
The following is the formula for the Gregorian calendar to determine whether an year is a
leap year or not. An year <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <!-- MATH
 $y \ge 1582$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I><IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/36/3680img1.png
 ALT="$ \ge$">1582</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <!-- MATH
 $y \neq 1700$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I> <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/36/3680img1.png
 ALT="$ \neq$"> 1700</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, is a leap year if and only if

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is divisible by 4, and
</LI>
<LI><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is not divisible by 100 unless it is divisible by 400.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
An year <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <!-- MATH
 $0 < y < 1582$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">0 &lt; <I>y</I> &lt; 1582</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is a leap year if and only if

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is divisible by 4. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Hence year 4 is a leap year, year 100 is a leap year, year 1900 is not a leap year, but year
2000 is a leap year. A leap year has 366 days with the extra day February 29. A non-leap year
has 365 days.

<P>
During your computation, you may also want to observe the following facts about Gregorian
calendar. Many calendar systems were used by people in different areas in the Western world
at the same time. The current Western calendar system, primarily follows Gregorian calendar,
and is so called the Gregorian Reformation, was adopted by Britain and the possessions on
September 3, 1752. For lots of reasons that we are sure you do not want to read in this problem
description, 11 days are eliminated starting September 3, 1752 in order for people not to rewrite
history. That is, in the Gregorian calendar, there is no days in between September 3, 1752 and
September 13, 1752. Note that Rome adopted the Gregorian calendar at the year 1582, when it
was invented. Also for historical reasons, the year 1700 is declared a leap year in the Gregorian
calendar. There are other variations about the Gregorian calendar system, however, we will use
the one that is dened above.

<P>
A lunar <SPAN  CLASS="textit">month</SPAN> is defined to be the average time between successive new or full moons
which is 29.531 days. People observe in average 12.368 full moons in an year. Unfortunately,
this is also not an integral number in terms of days. Hence if we set an year to have 12 months
with each month having 30 days, we need to add several days each year. To save the trouble,
an alternative way is to have the number of days in a month to alternative between 30 and 31.
However, this introduces one extra day. After lots of struggle, the Gregorian calendar defined
the numbers of days in each month during a non-leap year to be 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31,
30, 31, 30, 31, respectively from the first month to the 12th month. One more day is added
on February in the leap year. The names for the months in sequence from the first month --
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and
December, are also very interesting and have lots of stories associated with them. For example,
the Roman Senate named the month of July after Julius Caesar to honor him for reforming
their calendar. However, we do not have time to cover them here.

<P>
In ancient time, a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">week</SPAN> may have different number of days, say from 4 to 10 days. In
the Gregorian calendar system, a week corresponds roughly to the moon's quarter phase whose
position can be clearly observed by people. Hence people can easily measure a week. Also for
some other reasons, such as religion, it is defined as 7 days. The names of the 7 days in sequence
-- Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, all have interesting
stories. However, we also do not have time to cover them here.

<P>
Throughout history, people believe the relative positions of the stars can decide their fate.
This is also true for people living in an island <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. In island <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, people are working from Monday
through Friday every week and enjoy holidays on every Saturday and Sunday without exceptions.
There is no other holidays. From ancient tales, a month is called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">lucky</SPAN> if the last working day in
this month is Friday. For examples, the last working day of September, 2006 is September 29,
2006 -- which is Friday. Hence it is lucky. The last working day of July, 2006 is July 31, 2006
-- which is Monday. Hence it is not lucky. The last working day of August, 2006 is August
31, 2006 -- which is Thursday. Hence it is also not lucky. It is believed that if one eats only
vegetable everyday during a lucky month, he/she will have a good fortune in getting rich.

<P>
Also from ancient tales, a month is called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">good</SPAN> if the first working day in this month is
Monday. For examples, the first working day of July, 2006 is July 3, 2006 -- which is Monday.
Hence it is good. The first working day of October, 2006 is October 2, 2006 -- which is Monday.
Hence it is also good. The first working day of August, 2006 is August 1, 2006 -- which is
Tuesday. Hence it is not good. The first working day of September, 2006 is September 1, 2006
-- which is Friday. Hence it is also not good. It is believed that if one goes to bed before 10
PM every day during a good month, he/she will be very healthy. A month can be both good
and lucky at the same time.

<P>
Given a period of time, your task is to report the number of lucky months and the number
good months during this period of time using the described Gregorian calendar system.

You can use the following result:<P><SPAN CLASS="textit">If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is a tree, then the number of days needed is either <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> or <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> + 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the maximum number of vertices contained in a directed path of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, i.e., a path <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I> = (<I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB>,..., <I>x</I><SUB>k</SUB>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, where for each <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> = 1, 2,..., <I>k</I> - 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, there is a directed edge from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I><SUB>i+1</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.</SPAN><P>Figure 1 below is such an example. There are six jobs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. From this figure, we know that job 1 and job 2 must be done in different dates.

Each tree has at most 200 vertices. We represent each tree as a rooted tree (just for convenience of presentation, the root is an arbitrarily chosen vertex). Information of each of the trees are contained in a number of lines. Each line starts with a vertex (which is a positive integer) followed by all its sons (which are also positive integers), then followed by a 0. Note that 0 is not a vertex, and it indicates the end of that line. Now some of the edges are directed. The direction of an edge can be from father to son, and can also be from son to father. If the edge is from father to son, then we put a letter ``<TT>d</TT>" after that son (meaning that it is a downward edge). If the edge is from son to father, then we put a letter ``<TT>u</TT>" after that son (meaning that it is an upward edge).

A set of servers in the network forms a <SPAN CLASS="textit">perfect service</SPAN> if every client (non-server) is served by <SPAN CLASS="textbf">exactly one</SPAN> server.

<P>
Mr. Smyth wants to leave his son, Peter, a part of his land as inheritance. This is a very big piece of land which is in the shape of a simple polygon. The only condition is that his son has to start building walls within his father's land in such a way that he has an area of land that is also in the shape of a simple polygon. 

<P>
Peter is a very lazy person and prefers to pay someone to build the walls. However, the people contracted by Peter forgot the boundaries that limit Mr. Smyth's land. But they did not worry about this and went ahead and built the walls. On the contrary, if they told Peter that they had forgotten the boundaries of Mr. Smyth's land Peter could get angry and he may fired his employee. 

<P>
Mr. Smyth knows his son very well and he will only leave land to his son if he builds walls that do not invade the land of his neighbors', (that is, no wall must be outside Mr. Smyth's land), and the walls built by his son must form an enclosed area. 

<P>
Finally, Mr. Smyth wants to know the area of the land left for himself.

The ACM-ICPC brings together the top student programmers from all over the world, and provides them with opportunities to develop critical skills which will give them a competitive edge when they launch careers in information technology areas. More than 5,600 teams from 84 countries had competed in regional contests last year. An ever larger number of teams - more than 7,000 teams from different countries worldwide - have registered in this year's regional contests. However, due to the limited capacity of each site, only a small amount of the registered teams can be allowed to participate in the on-site contest. It is really hard for the contest organizers to determine which teams should be allowed to participate. One of the possible solutions is to hold a preliminary internet contest before the on-site competition. The following part describes a simplified version of rules for team selection: 

<P>
Up to three teams from each school can participate in the on-site contest, depending on how many following conditions the school in question meets: 

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>a)</DT>
<DD>A team from this school has solved at least <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>

<DD>Some of the teams from this school ranked top 20 in previous World Finals; 
</DD>
<DT>c)</DT>
<DD>This school has hosted a provincial contest this year.

In the new ACM-ICPC Regional Contest, a special monitoring and submitting system will be set up, and students will be able to compete at their own universities. However there's one problem. Due to the high cost of the new judging system, the organizing committee can only afford to set the system up such that there will be only one way to transfer information from one university to another without passing the same university twice. The contestants will be divided into two connected regions, and the difference between the total numbers of students from two regions should be minimized. Can you help the juries to find the minimum difference?

<P>It is the 22<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><SUP>th</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> century, and machines with supreme artificial intelligence have conquered the world. Humans are kept alive by a computer controlled program, the Matrix, for no other purpose than providing energy to the machines. Only a small group of freedom fighters have escaped the Matrix and built a secret resist base, Zion, near the core of the earth. However the machines have discovered this and send down millions of sentinels to destroy Zion.<P>The underground world is actually the sewers of the previous cities in ruin -- gigantic tunnels connecting the ground, Zion, and various other intersections. However all sewers have been destroyed when the machines first conquered the mankind. Because of limited time, the sewers have been repaired by people from Zion such that there will always be no more than one path from one intersection to another. No tunnel connects an intersection to itself. The best weapon we have is EMP (electromagnetic pulse) charge, an extremely powerful weapon to use against machines. Blowing an EMP charge will cause any electronic device within its range to stop functioning, therefore destroying the machines within range completely. However it can also cause another EMP charge within the range to malfunction, so the distance between any two EMP charges must be no less than their range.<P>The council has decided to put EMP on certain intersections to minimize the possibility of the machines destroying Zion. Since our resources are limited, we can only afford to put EMP charges on certain intersections of the underground tunnels. Deploying an EMP charge on a certain intersection has a non-negative cost.

<P>In the world of telecommunications phone calls to different phone numbers have to be charged using different rate or different billing plan. International Carrier of Phone Communications (ICPC) has an antique billing table that determines which phone call has to be charged using which billing plan.<P>Each international phone number has 11 digits. The billing table has <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> lines. Each line specifies a range of prefixes of phone numbers like ``<TT>7919 - 921</TT>". This specification means that all phone numbers starting from 7919, 7920, and 7921 match this line. A billing plan name is specified for each prefix. To determine a billing plan for a call, the table is scanned from top to bottom and the first matching line determines the billing plan. If no match is found, the phone number is invalid and no billing plan is needed. A special billing plan named ``<TT>invalid</TT>" (without quotes) is used as an alternative way to define invalid phone numbers. Some billing plans are used for quite differently looking phone numbers and their names may be specified on difffferent lines in different places of the table.<P>ICPC's billing table is old and contains many entries. Some of those entries may not be even used anymore. It is very hard to figure out which phone numbers each billing plan is actually used for. The ICPC's management has reached a decision to transform this billing table into a more legible format. In this new format table consists of the lexicographically ordered list of simple prefixes (without the ``-" range feature of the old format) with a billing plan name for each prefix. No prefix of this new billing table should be a prefix of any other prefix from the table. Thus, a simple dictionary lookup (binary search, for example) will be sufficient to figure out a billing plan for a given phone number. Finding all phone numbers for a given billing plan will also become quite a simple task. The number of lines in the new billing table should be minimized. Billing plan named ``<TT>invalid</TT>" should not be present in the new billing table at all, since invalid phone numbers will be denoted by absence of the corresponding prefix in the new billing table.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P><B>The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below.

<P>A <SPAN CLASS="textit">cellular automaton</SPAN> is a collection of cells on a grid of specified shape that evolves through a number of discrete time steps according to a set of rules that describe the new state of a cell based on the states of neighboring cells.

<P>
Contrary to the popular belief, alien flying saucers cannot fly 
arbitrarily around our planet Earth. Their touch down and take off 
maneuvers are extremely energy consuming, so they carefully plan their mission 
to Earth to touch down in one particular place, then hover above the 
ground carrying out their mission, then take off. It was all so easy 
when human civilization was in its infancy, since flying saucers can 
hover above all the trees and building, and their shortest path from one 
mission point to the other was usually a simple straight line -- the 
most efficient way to travel. However, modern cities have so tall 
skyscrapers that flying saucers cannot hover above them and the task of 
navigating modern city became quite a complex one. You were hired by an alien 
spy to write a piece of software that will ultimately give flying 
saucers driving directions throughout the city. As your first assignment 
(to prove your worth to your alien masters) you should write a program 
that computes the shortest distance for a flying saucer from one point 
to another. This program will be used by aliens as an aid in planning 
of mission energy requirements. 

<P>
The problem is simplified by several 
facts. First of all, since flying saucer can hover above most of the 
buildings, you are only concerned with locations of skyscrapers. Second, 
the problem is actually twodimensional -- you can look at everything 
``from above" and pretend that all objects are situated on <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>OXY</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> 
Cartesian plane. Flying saucer is represented by a circle of radius <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and 
since modern cities with skyscrapers tend to be regular, every skyscraper 
is represented with a rectangle whose sides are parallel to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>OX</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>OY</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> 
axes. 

<P>
By definition, the location of flying saucer is the location of 
its center, and the length of the path it travels is the length of the 
path its center travels. During its mission flying saucer can touch 
skyscrapers but it cannot intersect them. 

<P>
At the first picture a flying 
saucer of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I> = 1</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> has to get from point <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> to point <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The straight dashed 
line would have been the shortest path if not for skyscraper 1. The 
shortest way to avoid skyscraper 1 is going around its top right corner, 
but skyscraper 2 is too close to fly there. Thus, the answer is to go 
around the bottom left corner of skyscraper 1 for a total path length of 
10.570796. 

<P>
In the second picture it is impossible for a flying saucer 
of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I> = 2</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> to get from point <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> to point <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, since all skyscrapers are too 
close to fly in between them. 

<P>
In the third picture flying saucer of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I> = 1</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> has to fly in a slalom-like way around two skyscrapers in order to 
achieve the shortest path of length 11.652892 between <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>

one. Otherwise, write to the output a line with a single number -- the 
shortest distance that the flying saucer needs to travel to get from the 
starting point to the finishing point. Answer has to be precise to at 
least 6 digits after the decimal point.

<P>You are taking part in a large project to automate operations for Northeastern Exchange of Resources and Commodities (NEERC). Different resources and commodities are traded on this exchange via public auction. Each resource or commodity is traded independently of the others and your task is to write a core engine for this exchange -- its order book. There is a separate instance of an order book for each traded resource or commodity and it is not your problem to get the correct orders into order books. The order book instance you will be writing is going to receive the appropriate orders from the rest of exchange system.<P>Order book receives a stream of <SPAN CLASS="textit">messages</SPAN>. Messages are <SPAN CLASS="textit">orders</SPAN> and requests to cancel previously issued orders. Orders that were not cancelled are called <SPAN CLASS="textit">active</SPAN>. There are orders to <SPAN CLASS="textit">buy</SPAN> and orders to <SPAN CLASS="textit">sell</SPAN>. Each order to buy or to sell has a positive <SPAN CLASS="textit">size</SPAN> and a positive <SPAN CLASS="textit">price</SPAN>. Order book maintains a list of active orders and generates <SPAN CLASS="textit">quotes</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="textit">trades</SPAN>. Active order to buy at the highest price is the best buy order and its price is called <SPAN CLASS="textit">bid</SPAN> price. Active order to sell at the lowest price is the best sell order and its price is called <SPAN CLASS="textit">ask</SPAN> price. Ask price is always lower than bid price, that is, buyers are willing to pay less than sellers want to receive in return.<P>A current quote from the order book contains current bid size, bid price, ask size, and ask price. Here bid and ask sizes are sums of the the sizes of all active orders with the current bid price and the current ask price correspondingly.<P>A trade records information about transaction between buyer and seller. Each trade has size and price.<P>If an order to buy arrives to the order book at a price greater or equal to the current ask price, then the corresponding orders are <SPAN CLASS="textit">matched</SPAN> and trade happens -- buyer and seller reached agreement on a price. Vice versa, if an order to sell arrives to the order book at a price less or equal to the current bid price, then trade happens, too. For the purpose of order matching, order book works like a FIFO queue for orders with the same price (read further for details).<P>When an order to buy arrives to the order book at a price greater or equal to the current ask price it is not immediately entered into the order book. First, a number of trades is generated, possibly reducing the size of incoming order. Trade is generated between incoming buy order and the best order to sell. If there are multiple best orders (at the ask price), then the order that entered the order book first is chosen. Trade is generated at the current ask price with the size of the trade being equal to the smaller of the sizes of two matching orders. Sizes of both matching orders are reduced by the size of the trade. If that reduces the size of sell order to zero, then it becomes inactive and is removed from the order book. If the size of incoming buy order becomes zero, then the process is over -- incoming order becomes inactive. If the size of incoming buy order is still positive and there is another sell order to match with, then the process continues generating further trades at the new ask price (ask price can increase as sell orders are traded against and become inactive). If there is no sell order to match with (current ask price became greater than incoming buy order price), then incoming buy order is added to the order book with its remaining size.<P>For incoming sell order everything works similarly -- it is matched with buy orders from the order book and trades are generated on bid price.<P>On incoming cancel request the corresponding order is simply removed from the order book and becomes inactive. Note, that by the time of the cancel request the quantity of the corresponding order might have been already partially reduced or the order might have become inactive. Requests to cancel inactive order do not change anything in the order book.<P>On every incoming message the order book has to generate all trades it causes and the current quote (bid size, bid price, ask size, ask price) after processing of the corresponding message, even when nothing has changed in the order book as a result of this message. Thus, the number of quotes the order book generates is always equal to the number of incoming messages.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P><B>The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below.

<P>
A card game, often called ``Fool's Game", is quite popular in Russia. We will describe a game 
for two players. A standard deck of 36 cards is used. One suit is declared to be a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">trump</SPAN>. 

<P>
A game consists of rounds. Before the round each 
player has several cards, one of the players is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">starting</SPAN>, the other one is 
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">covering</SPAN>. The starting player starts by laying one or several cards of 
the same rank down on the table. The number of cards must not exceed 
the number of cards the covering player has. The covering player must in 
turn <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cover</SPAN> all the cards with some of her cards, laying them on the 
table above the uncovered cards. A card can cover another if one of the 
following is true: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>it has the same suit and higher rank (ranks are ordered as usually: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A); 
</LI>
<LI>it is a trump and the card to cover is not a trump (a trump can only be covered by a higher trump). 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
After the cards on the table are all covered, the starting 
player can <SPAN  CLASS="textit">toss</SPAN> some more cards to be covered. The rank of each card tossed 
must be among the ranks of the cards already on the table at the 
moment. Now the newly added cards must be covered by the covering player, 
after that the starting player can toss more cards, and so on. The 
starting player cannot toss more cards than the covering player has at the 
moment. 

<P>
The round ends when either the covering player cannot or does not 
want to cover all uncovered cards on the table, or when the starting 
player cannot or does not want to toss more cards. 

<P>
In the first case, when the covering player declares that she does not want to cover all 
uncovered cards on the table, the starting player is given a chance to 
toss in more cards. The ranks of the cards tossed must be among the ranks 
of the cards already on the table. The number of uncovered cards on the 
table cannot exceed the number of cards that the covering player has at 
the moment. After that, the covering player loses the round and takes 
all the cards from the table, adding them to her cards. Starting player 
keeps her starting role and moves again in the next round. 

<P>
In the second case, when all cards on the table are covered and the starting player 
cannot or does not want to toss more cards, the covering player wins 
the round and the cards on the table are removed from the game. The 
players' roles for the next round are swapped: the covering player becomes 
the starting one and vice versa. 

<P>
If, after the end of the round, one of the players has no cards, and the other one has one or more cards, then 
the player with no cards wins the game. If both players have no cards, 
then the player who was starting in the last round wins the game. 

<P>
Given the trump suit and the cards the players initially have, find out who 
wins the game if both play optimally. Both players have full 
information about cards in the game.

<P>Programming contests became so popular in the year 2397 that the governor of New Earck -- the largest human-inhabited planet of the galaxy -- opened a special Alley of Contestant Memories (ACM) at the local graveyard. The ACM encircles a green park, and holds the holographic statues of famous contestants placed equidistantly along the park perimeter. The alley has to be renewed from time to time when a new group of memorials arrives.<P>When new memorials are added, the exact place for each can be selected arbitrarily along the ACM, but the equidistant disposition must be maintained by moving some of the old statues along the alley.<P>Surprisingly, humans are still quite superstitious in 24th century: the graveyard keepers believe the holograms are holding dead people souls, and thus always try to renew the ACM with minimal possible movements of existing statues (besides, the holographic equipment is very heavy). Statues are moved along the park perimeter. Your work is to find a renewal plan which minimizes the sum of travel distances of all statues.

There are two serious problems in the Kingdom of Lipshire: the roads and the fools 
who build them. Once upon a time, the King of Lipshire has decided to 
improve the road system because some roads became completely impassable 
-- it was easier to travel cross-country instead of using those roads. 

<P>
By King's decree, new roads are to be built in Lipshire. Of course, 
the new road system must interconnect all towns, i. e. there must be a 
path connecting any two towns of Lipshire. 

<P>
The road administration of 
Lipshire has resources to build exactly one road per year. Unfortunately, 
the fools who build these roads are completely out of control. So, 
regardless of the orders given, the fools randomly select two different 
towns <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and build a road between them, even when those towns are 
already connected by a road. All possible choices are equiprobable. The 
road is build in such a manner that the only points where a traveler can 
leave it are the towns connected by this road. The only good thing is 
that all roads are bidirectional. 

<P>
The King knows about the problem, but 
he cannot do anything about it. The only thing King needs to know is 
the expected number of years to wait before the road system of Lipshire 
becomes interconnected. He asked you to provide this information.

Apologists of Java and C++ can argue for hours proving each other that 
their programming language is the best one. Java people will tell that 
their programs are clearer and less prone to errors, while C++ people 
will laugh at their inability to instantiate an array of generics or 
tell them that their programs are slow and have long source code. 

<P>
Another issue that Java and C++ people could never agree on is identifier 
naming. In Java a multiword identifier is constructed in the following 
manner: the first word is written starting from the small letter, and the 
following ones are written starting from the capital letter, no 
separators are used. All other letters are small. Examples of a Java 
identifier are <TT>javaIdentifier</TT>, <TT>longAndMnemonicIdentifier</TT>, <TT>name</TT>, <TT>nEERC</TT>. 

<P>
Unlike them, C++ people use only small letters in their identiÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚Â�ers. To 
separate words they use underscore character `<TT>-</TT>'. Examples of C++ 
identifiers are <TT>c_identifier</TT>, <TT>long_and_mnemonic_identifier</TT>, <TT>name</TT> (you see 
that when there is just one word Java and C++ people agree), <TT>n_e_e_r_c</TT>. 

<P>
You are writing a translator that is intended to translate C++ programs 
to Java and vice versa. Of course, identifiers in the translated 
program must be formatted due to its language rules -- otherwise people will 
never like your translator. 

<P>
The first thing you would like to write is 
an identifier translation routine. Given an identifier, it would 
detect whether it is Java identifier or C++ identifier and translate it 
to another dialect. If it is neither, then your routine should report an 
error. Translation must preserve the order of words and must only 
change the case of letters and/or add/remove underscores.

A research laboratory of a world-leading automobile company has received an order to 
create a special transmission mechanism, which allows for incredibly 
efficient kickdown -- an operation of switching to lower gear. After several 
months of research engineers found that the most efficient solution 
requires special gears with teeth and cavities placed non-uniformly. They 
calculated the optimal flanks of the gears. Now they want to perform 
some experiments to prove their findings. 

<P>
The first phase of the experiment is done with planar toothed sections, not round-shaped gears. A 
section of length <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> consists of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> units. The unit is either a cavity of 
height <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>h</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> or a tooth of height <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<I>h</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Two sections are required for the 
experiment: one to emulate master gear (with teeth at the bottom) and one 
for the driven gear (with teeth at the top).

<P>The Widget Corporation has developed the greatest technological advance of the century: the megawidget. The megawidget uses revolutionary new technologies, thus completely new factories have to be built. The megawidget consists of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> subunits; each subunit will be produced in a different factory. Widget production requires large amount of water, thus the new factories will be located on the banks of the Purple River.

During the production of a widget, certain subunits should be moved very quickly from one factory to another. Unfortunately, it is impossible to build roads between the factories, since the terrain is too rough. Therefore, the only way you can move subunits between two factories if you build a bridge connecting them. By definition, a bridge has to cross the river, thus you cannot build a bridge that connects two factories on the same bank. Furthermore, due to technological limitations, two bridges cannot cross each other. The figure shows a possible layout of 6 factories and 5 bridges.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="728" HEIGHT="268" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/37/p3714.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p3714.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>You are given a list specifying which pairs of factories should be connected by bridges, and your task is to find a location for each factory such that the bridges can be built without crossing.

Helicopters are very expensive, so we can afford to replace at most 2 bridges with helicopters.

<P>In the monastery of Hotoshopp, the monks perform a mysterious ritual every midnight.

There are many chimes in the monastery, but there are only <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> different types of chimes. Every chime produces a perfect triangle wave (see below for details) and chimes of the same type produce exactly the same sound. A Type 1 chime produces a sound of frequency 10Hz and the frequency of a Type <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> chime is double the frequency of a Type <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> - 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> chime.<P>Usually not all the chimes are sounded during the ritual; there are very strict rules that determine which combination of chimes are sounded at midnight on a given day.

For example, if there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> = 4</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> chimes, then the Type 4 chimes have frequency 80Hz, thus there are 160 samples per second.

<P>A DNA sequence or genetic sequence is a succession of letters representing the primary structure of a real or hypothetical DNA molecule or strand, with the capacity to carry information. The possible letters are A, C, G, and T, representing the four nucleotide subunits of a DNA strand: adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine bases covalently linked to phospho-backbone.<P>DNA sequences undergo mutations during the evolution of species, which means that some letters are randomly replaced with others. Therefore, the DNA sequences of two closely related species are very similar, and the difference increases as the distance between the species increases. The mutations do not occur with uniform frequency throughout the sequence; typically there are fewer mutations at the biologically important parts, since even a single mutation can be lethal at such a place. On the other hand, if a part of the sequence does not carry any biologically relevant information, then mutations on this part have no effect. It follows that if we compare the DNA sequences of two species and a particular region of the sequence contains fewer than the average number of mutations, then most probably this part of the sequence plays an important biological role. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to identify such regions. More precisely, a <SPAN CLASS="textit">conserved region</SPAN> is a consecutive interval of the DNA sequence such that in this region at most <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> percent of the letters are different in the two sequences.

<P>After the very exciting 2006 ICPC finals in San Antonio (Texas), ACM has decided to start a new radio station that will broadcast news, music and useful programming tricks to the farmers in Texas. The radio station itself will not be in Texas; it will be located at Saratov State University (Russia), whose team won the 2006 finals. Who else could give better programming advice than the winners?<P>In order to reach every ranch in Texas, powerful antennas have to be installed at the radio station. These antennas are very expensive, and they can broadcast only at a limited angle. More precisely, the price of an antenna is proportional to the <SPAN CLASS="textit">square</SPAN> of the angle. The cheapest antenna can broadcast across a 1-degree range and costs 1 unit of money; the second cheapest broadcasts across a 2-degree range andcosts 4 units, etc. For example, if the radio station is at (0,0) and there are two ranches at (0, 2) and (2, 2), then a 45-degree antenna (costing 2025) can broadcast to both ranches at the same time, but a 44-degree antenna (costing 1936) can broadcast to at most one of the ranches. The angle of the antenna is always an integer, thus there are 360 different types of antennas.<P>Your task is to optimize the type and position of the antennas such that every ranch is reached and the total cost is minimized.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several blocks of test cases.

<P>Travelling in the Infinite Desert is very difficult, dangerous, and boring. Without roads and railway tracks, camel riding is the only form of travel that is available between the cities of the desert. The Desert Development Committee has decided to build a super fast train to connect the cities. The train is so fast that it can go only on a perfectly straight track; even the slightest turn would result in a catastrophe. Therefore, the train track that will be built should be one straight line segment, which means that not every city will be reached by the train. Your task is to design the track in such a way that the number of people who can use the train is maximized. The citizens of a city can only use the train line if the track goes 1 km or closer to the city centre.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several blocks of test cases.

When someone buys land, then the first thing they do is to plant grass on the land; everyone wants to make sure that their grass is greener than the neighbour's. Depending on the type of grass, planting it has a certain cost. The next thing to do is to build a fence around the land; the cost of the fence depends of the type of the fence (green or white, with or without barbed wire, electric or not, etc.) Everyone has a very particular idea about the type of grass and the type of fence they want. In fact, everyone firstly decided upon the type of grass and fence, and then bought the largest piece of land they could afford (i.e., they could buy the land, the grass, andthe fence). In Squareville, you can buy only square-shaped land, but you can buy any size you want. We assume that everyone plants grass across the whole area of land and everyone builds a fence around the full perimeter, i.e., on all four sides.<P>Having a larger garden means that you are more respected in Squareville.

<P>The ideal holiday for many people involves being on the white sand of a sunny beach on a tropical island, drinking cocktails under the palm trees and swimming, snorkelling and diving in the clear blue waves. The Algorithmic Archipelago is the ideal place for such a holiday as it consists of countless beautiful islands. Since many tourists spend their holidays (and money) on these islands, you decided to enter the tourism industry and buy an island.

<P>According to ancient legends, deep in the Forest of Walking Trees lies a mystical cave called the Cave of Infinite Wealth. In the middle of a huge cavern there is a lake surrounded by stalactites and stalagmites. The dark, cold water of the lake has magical properties; if anyone tosses a gold coin into the lake at midnight and spends the night in the cave, then he will find that he has more money in the morning than he had in the evening. More precisely, if he had <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> gold coins (after tossing one into the water), then hewill have <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/37/3722img1.png ALT="$ \alpha$"><I>x</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> gold coins in the morning.<P>The famous adventurer Gorgon Rattlesnake spent many years finding the cave.

In recent years it has become very fashionable to buy widgets and the demand for widgets increased above all expectations. In fact, the supply cannot keep up with the demand: every widgeteer is busy building widgets all day. The Association for Widget Production realized the problem and decided that new widgeteers have to be trained. Training widgeteers is a long process: a beginner's course on widgeteering lasts <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> days with a 2-hour training session on each day. Due to the lack of qualified teachers, only two group of students will be admitted to the course. To accommodate the different lifestyles of the students,the training sessions of the two groups take place at different times of the day. Each student is available only for a certain period of time on each day. Therefore, the assignment of the students into groups and the scheduling of the training sessions should be done in such a way that every student can attend every session.

Benjamin 
Go to the Regionals</A>&nbsp;</FONT></B></TABLE></CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is considering new rules 
for its regional programming contests, in part to solve some
software problems. For instance, the program that prints out the badges 
for each team was
designed so that the same font size is used to print all badges for 
that team. However,
this means that if one member of the team has a very long name, then a 
very small font will be
used to print all of the team's badges, and this wouldn't look very 
nice for someone with an
extremely short name like ``AL".

<P>
The initial solution proposed by the ACM was to put a limit on the 
length of contestants' names.
Someone pointed out that this would discriminate against teams from 
certain regions where
bigger names are more common (for instance, children in the home towns 
of well-known actors are
more likely to be named after that actor - imagine how many children 
in Oakland, California
have been named after the actor Mahershalalhashbaz Ali since he became 
one of the stars of the
television series <I>The 4400</I>). 

<P>
As a compromise, the ACM decided to change the rule to require that 
``no team member's name can have
length more than two away from the average length of all the team 
member's names." Using this
rule, a team consisting of ``MAHERSHALALHASHBAZ", ``AL", and ``BILL" 
would be disqualified
(average name length is 8, so AL and BILL are not within 2). However, 
``MAHERSHALALHASHBAZ",
``NEBUCHADNEZZAR", and ``BILLYBOBBENJAMIN" would be okay (average name 
length is 16, and all
team member names have length within 2 of this number). 

<P>
Given the names of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> students, determine whether or not they can be 
placed into teams of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>
members each so that each team meets the requirements of the new ACM 
rule.

<P>The Advancement of Collegiate Mastermind (hey, that's ACM again...weird!) is an organization which (among other things) holds classes for college students to improve their Mastermind skills. Recall that basic Mastermind is a two-player game which works as follows: The first player - the codemaker - creates a secret 4-color code, each color taken from one of six colors (we'll use A,B,C,D,E and F for the colors). The other player - the codebreaker - now must try to guess the codemaker's code. After each guess, the codemaker uses black and white pegs to tell the codebreaker two things: the number of correct colors in the correct positions (the black pegs), and the number of remaining correct colors that are in the wrong positions (the white pegs). For example, if the true code is ABCC, and the codebreaker makes the guess ACCD, then the response would be 2 black and 1 white; if the guess was CCAA, the response would be 3 white. the The codebreaker continues making guesses until he receives 4 blacks. More advanced versions of Mastermind increase both the length of the code and the number of colors to choose from.<P>The ACM's master instructor is Dee Sifer, and she has a unique ability: when given a set of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> guesses and responses, she can immediately determine what the best <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>n</I> + 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-st guess should be. For each possible <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>n</I> + 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-st guess, Dee calculates (in her head) the number of codes left for each possible response she could get to that guess. The maximum of these numbers over all responses is called the <EM>uncertainty</EM> of the guess. The ``best'' guess is the one with the minimum uncertainty. For example, suppose that you get to a point in a game where you've narrowed down the answer to only three possible codes: ABBB, ABBC or ABCB. If your next guess is ABBB, there would be two possible responses: 4 blacks (leaving 0 remaining possibilities left) or 3 blacks (leaving 2 remaining possibilities - ABBC and ABCB). However, if instead of ABBB you try ABBC, then there are 3 possible responses: 4 blacks (leaving 0 possibilities), 3 blacks (leaving 1 possibility - ABBB) and 2 blacks and 2 whites (also leaving 1 possibility - ABCB). Thus ABBC would be a better guess in this case, since the uncertainty it leaves is 1, whereas the uncertainty for ABBB is 2.<P>This is all well and good, except for one thing. You have been selected as Dee's successor, and you do NOT have Dee's ability to pick the minimum uncertainty guess. Dee has been dropping hints (in code) that she plans to retire soon, so you need a program to help you simulate her ability.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Input will consist of multiple test cases.

<P>The <EM>Knick Knack Plaque Shack</EM> designs plaques of unusual shapes.

Each day he is assigned the task of shipping all the plaques of a certain width to the various department stores which sell them. He has at his disposal boxes with a depth of 1 and a width equal to the plaques' width. As the plaques come off the assembly line, he fits them into the boxes one at a time. When placed in a box, each plaque will slide down until some part of it touches the topmost plaque already in the box (or the bottom of the box if it is the first plaque). For example, if the leftmost plaque above came off the assembly line first, followed by the middle and then the rightmost, they would stack up one on top of the other as shown on the left. If they came off the assembly line in reverse order, they would stack up as shown on the right.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="206" HEIGHT="190" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/37/p3728a.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p3728b.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>When a plaque comes off the assembly line which will not fit into the box (i.e., it sticks up over the top), Ben closes that box, ships it off, and starts a new box.

<P>Bill Eaves owns the <EM>Shingle Minded</EM> roofing company which is a sub-contracting firm specializing in putting roofs on buildings. Often, Bill will receive a design for a roof from some young hot-shot architect which, though it may have some aesthetic appeal, is totally impractical. In these cases, Bill will begin negotiations with the architect and the client to find a simpler design. Bill's only concern is that the roof be convex, to allow rain, snow and frisbees to roll off easily. The architect's main concern is that the maximum height between his original roof and the compromise roof be as small as possible. The client's main concern is to get out of this meeting as soon as possible and get back to watching TV.<P>The architect's plans for the roof come in the form of a series of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> points <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>i</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>i</SUB>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> specifying the outline of the roof as seen from the side of the house. The roofs are always symmetrical, so the architect only shows the front side of the roof (from its start at the front of the house to its peak). Once Bill gets these plans and a decision is made on how many sections the convex roof should have, he must decide how to place the sections so as to 1) make sure that all the original <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>i</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>i</SUB>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> points lie on or below the new roof, and 2) to minimize the maximum vertical distance between any of the original <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I><SUB>i</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>i</SUB>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> points and the new roof. All sections must lie on at least two of the initial points specified by the architect. An example is shown below. On the left are the initial points from the architect. The next two pictures show an approximation of the roof using only two sections. While both of these are convex, the second of the two is the one which minimizes the maximum distance.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="1083" HEIGHT="256" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/37/p3729.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p3729.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Input will consist of multiple test cases.

The designers at Gazillion Games Inc. have come up with a new, 
relatively simple game called ``Stake Your Claim".  Two players - 0 and 1 - initially 
select two values <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and an <!-- MATH
 $n \times n$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I>&#215;<I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> board is created with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> 0's 
and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> 1's randomly placed on the board.  Starting with player 0, each player puts his/her 
number in one of the empty squares on the board.  After the board is filled, 
each player's score is equal to the largest connected region on the board 
filled with that player's number (where a connected region is one where for 
any two squares in the region a path exists consisting of only N/S/E/W moves).  
The player with the highest score wins, and is
awarded the difference between his/her score and the score of the other 
player. Two examples of
finished games are shown below, with the largest connected regions for 
each player outlined.
Note in the second example that the two sections with 2 0's each are 
not connected.

In order to test how good this game is, the gang at Gazillion has hired 
you to write a program which can play the game.  Specifically, given any starting 
configuration, they would like a
program to determine the best move for the current player, i.e., the 
score which maximizes the points awarded to that player (or minimizes those awarded to the 
player's opponent).

Decimal numbers can be displayed using one or more seven-segment displays. The segments are arranged so that illuminating selected segments yields a pattern corresponding to a decimal digit. The patterns used in this problem are show below. There are three horizontal segments (each illustrated by two hyphens), and four vertical segments (each illustrated by a vertical stroke).

</DIV>

<P>
Each of the segments in a single display has an expected lifetime specified by the manufacturer. This lifetime is the minimum cumulative time each segment is expected to be capable of being illuminated, independent of how frequently it is turned on or off. 

<P>
In normal use, a display doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t always illuminate the same segments. That is, different digits are displayed with different frequencies. As a result, some segments might be illuminated longer than others, and thus the actual length of time the display can be expected to display the proper results is dependent on the values it displays. 

<P>
Given the values to be displayed, their probability of appearance, and the lifetime specified by the manufacturer, you are to determine the minimum time the display can be expected to display the proper values. 

<P>
Multiple single-digit displays may be required, the actual number of such depending on the largest value to be displayed. Values are displayed with leading zeroes, if necessary, to use all single-digit displays. The displays are entirely blank (no segments illuminated) if no value is displayed. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Examples</SPAN>

<P>
As a simple example, suppose the manufacturer specifies a particular display as having a 100 hour lifetime. If only the digits 0 and 1 are displayed, each with a 25 percent probability, then the display will require only a single digit, and it will be blank 50 percent of the time. During the remaining time, the rightmost two vertical segments will be illuminated, since they are ``on" during the display of 0 or 1. Given these conditions, the display will correctly operate for at least 200 hours. 

<P>
Suppose the values to be displayed are 0, 1, 10, and 11, each with a probability of 25 percent. If the display has the same manufacturer-specified lifetime, then two single-digit display units will be required, and the display will correctly operate for at least 100 hours. 

<P>
Finally, assume arbitrary decimal digits are to be displayed (with equal probability) 50 percent of the time. With a segment lifetime of 50 hours, the display can be expected to operate correctly for at least 111.11 hours. This is because no segment is illuminated in more than 90 percent of the digits displayed.

<P>
For this problem there are multiple cases. The input for each case begins with two integers. The first of these is the manufacturer-specified lifetime of a display, in hours; the second is the number of ranges of values to be displayed. For each of these ranges there follows a group of three integers that give the lowest and highest values in the range, and the probability that one of these values will appear. The largest value will never require a display with more than six digits. Input for the last case is followed by a single integer <TT>-1</TT>.

<P>Welcome to Discrete Math I. Forty percent of your final grade will be based on your homework assignments. Now everyone can have a bad day from time to time, so you will be allowed to drop the scores of up to three of these assignments, but you have to choose which assignment scores to drop. Each assignment may have a different maximum score. Choose carefully, as the final homework grade will be the percentage ratio of your total score to the maximum possible score for the retained assignments.<P>Your team is to write a program that, given a list of assignment results, will calculate the best homework percentage grade that can be obtained by dropping zero, one, two, and three of the assignments.

Every person's blood has 2 markers called ABO <SPAN  CLASS="textit">alleles</SPAN>. Each of the markers is represented by one of three letters: <TT>A</TT>, <TT>B</TT>, or <TT>O</TT>. This gives six possible combinations of these alleles that a person can have, each of them resulting in a particular ABO <SPAN  CLASS="textit">blood type</SPAN> for that person.

Likewise, every person has two alleles for the blood <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Rh factor</SPAN>, represented by the characters <TT>+</TT> and <TT>-</TT>. Someone who is ``Rh positive" or ``Rh+" has at least one <TT>+</TT> allele, but could have two. Someone who is ``Rh negative" always has two <TT>-</TT> alleles. 

<P>
The blood type of a person is a combination of ABO blood type and Rh factor. The blood type is written by suffixing the ABO blood type with the <TT>+</TT> or <TT>-</TT> representing the Rh factor. Examples include <TT>A+</TT>, <TT>AB-</TT>, and <TT>O-</TT>. 

<P>
Blood types are inherited: each biological parent donates one ABO allele (randomly chosen from their two) and one Rh factor allele to their child. Therefore 2 ABO alleles and 2 Rh factor alleles of the parents determine the child's blood type. For example, if both parents of a child have blood type <TT>A-</TT>, then the child could have either type <TT>A-</TT> or type <TT>O-</TT> blood. A child of parents with blood types <TT>A+</TT> and <TT>B+</TT> could have any blood type. 

<P>
In this problem, you will be given the blood type of either both parents or one parent and a child; you will then determine the (possibly empty) set of blood types that might characterize the child or the other parent. 

<P>
Note: an uppercase letter ``Oh" is used in this problem to denote blood types, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> a digit (zero).

The input consists of multiple test cases.

To improve readability, whitespace may be included anywhere on the line except inside a single blood type specification. 

<P>
The last test case is followed by a line containing the letters <TT>E</TT>, <TT>N</TT>, and <TT>D</TT> separated by whitespace.

Each conveyor belt moves to the right. Packages fall off the end of the conveyor and into some other sorting bin. Suppose that the conveyors are of widths 10", 20", and 30" as in the diagram shown to the right.<P>All the packages are ``simple six sided boxes" with three dimensions. The person doing the sorting places each box on the appropriate conveyor. The proper conveyor to use is the narrowest one which is still wide enough to hold the package. We wish to use as little conveyor length as possible. All packages will fit on at least one conveyor, and (for example) a 20" conveyor would hold up to and including a 20" distance on one side of the package. Packages are placed on the conveyor with no space between them. In order to select the conveyor, you need to consider all dimensions of the package.<P><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="textbf">Examples</SPAN><P>Suppose a certain box is <SPAN CLASS="MATH">15"&#215;21"&#215;4"</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The sorting process first considers using the minimal conveyor length, so we desire to put the box on a conveyor such that the 4" side is traveling in the conveyor direction to the right. We can thus place the box on a 4" <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&#215;</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> 21" side so that it is 15" high, or we can place it on a 4" <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&#215;</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> 15" side and the package will stand 21" high. Since we want to use the narrowest possible conveyor, we select conveyor ``B" since the 20" width of the conveyor will handle the 15" dimension of the box (``A" is too narrow, ``C" is excessively wide). At this point, conveyor ``B" moves to the right 4" to accommodate the box, and the box is placed on the far left end of the belt.<P>Another box arrives which is <SPAN CLASS="MATH">12"&#215;24"&#215;19"</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. We use the 12" dimension for the linear distance, and can either stand the box on a 12" <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&#215;</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> 19" surface so it is 24" high, or on a 12" <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&#215;</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> 24" surface so it is 19" high.

Conveyor ``B" moves to the right by 12" to accommodate the box, and we place it on the belt.<P>After the two boxes described above have been processed, conveyor ``B" will look like this, with the first box to the right of the second box.

Since package dimensions are given as integral numbers of inches, there is no need to check for 2.5".

This line will be followed by additional lines, one for each box, in the order they are placed on the conveyor belts. Each of these lines contains three positive non-zero integers giving the dimensions of a box. The first of these lines gives data for box 1, the second line for box 2, and so forth.

Many people recognize the ``birthday paradox." It states that given a group of 23 or more randomly chosen persons, the probability that at least two of them will have the same birthday is more than 50%. Actually it isnÃ¢Â€Â™t a paradox, but is so named because it contradicts what most people would intuitively expect. 

<P>
But what is the probability that at least three persons in a group of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> randomly chosen persons share the same birthday? 

<P>
For simplicity we will assume that there are exactly 365 days in a year, and require that your answer be correct only within one tenth of a percent. For example, with 88 people in a group, the probability that at least three of these people will have the same birthday is 51.1 percent (with the result rounded to one fractional digit). Your answer could be any of 51.0 percent, 51.1 percent, or 51.2 percent and still be considered correct.

<P>Your company is constructing a device for the International Criminal Protection Council ICPC). This device can be used to detect e-mail messages containing words that suggest the message relates to an illegal activity, and thus require further attention. Since e-mail is abundant, and the networks are fast, the device needs to detect these words very quickly.

To make the lookup fast, you have decided to use a perfect hash function where each suspect word maps to a unique location in the table.<P>A perfect hash function maps its input directly to a fully-occupied table.

<P>
The Dean of ACM University's School of Programming Contests is responsible for assigning faculty to university committees. He has found that if he assigns faculty from different departments to a committee, they wind up discussing the socioeconomic importance of the number of bits in a byte and similar matters of earth-shaking importance but they never get any work done. On the other hand, if the faculty are all from the same department, they wind up discussing department business instead of university business. 

<P>
So the Dean wants to know if there is a way of assigning faculty to committees so that a majority (more then 50%) of faculty on each committee are from the same department (not necessarily the same department for different committees), but not all faculty on a committee are from the same department. The Dean thinks faculty ought to serve on at least two committees, but faculty refuse to serve on more than three committees.

The edges of the square are numbered, starting with 1, as shown above. To compute deflection, as discussed below, the edges are treated as if they were squares adjacent to the board. Board positions are identified by the ordered sequence of smallest edge numbers; for example, the top left gray box is at position <TT>1,7</TT>. 

<P>
The remaining input lines describe what happens to search rays which enter the square from each side, proceed horizontally and/or vertically, and are either deflected or absorbed by the marbles.

A ray is absorbed if it hits a marble directly. A line describing an absorbed ray contains a single positive number identifying the edge position where the ray enters the square; in this case:

A ray is deflected if it hits one of the diagonal neighbors of a marble: it is turned 90 degrees away from the marble and from its current direction. A ray can be deflected more then once. A line describing a deflected ray contains two positive numbers identifying the edge positions where the ray enters and leaves the square (separated by white space); in this case:

Note that input and output edge of a ray can always be interchanged. 

<P>
The last line is a special case: the ray starts at <TT>18</TT> and this edge is considered the diagonal neighbor of the marbles at <TT>1,9</TT> and <TT>1,7</TT>. The ray starts out going to the right. The first neighbor turns the ray up, the second neighbor turns the ray to the left. In summary, the ray is deflected twice and returns to its starting point <TT>18</TT>. 

<P>
One would expect that the list of absorbed and deflected rays contains each edge at least once. However, this example shows that that need not be the case: A ray starting at <TT>16</TT> is turned from going right to going down and never even reaches the board. Similarly, a ray starting at <TT>20</TT> is immediately turned up and misses the board, too.

<P>The DNA in your cells contains the instructions that specify the proteins that are synthesized by your body. DNA consists of a sequence of 4 nucleotides which can be represented by the letters A, T, G, and C. For example the string GCTGCTCGCGATAATAATGAA would represent a short DNA sequence consisting of 21 nucleotides. A protein consists of a sequence of amino acids, and like nucleotides, each amino acid is represented by a letter. There are 20 amino acids and they are represented by the characters: G, A, V, L, I, M, F, W, P, S, T, C, Y, N, Q, D, E, K, R, and H. The string AARDNNE would represent a protein consisting of 7 amino acids.<P>Genes, which can be viewed as substrings of the DNA sequence, direct the synthesis of proteins. The nucleotides in a gene are read in sequential order in groups of three. Each group of three nucleotides encodes a particular amino acid. A genetic code indicates what three nucleotides encode each amino acid. A subset of a genetic code is given below:<P><P><BR><TABLE COLS=2><COL ALIGN=LEFT><COL ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>A</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>GCT GCG GCC GCA</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>R</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>CGT CGG CGC CGA AGG AGA</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>D</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>GAT GAC</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>N</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>AAT AAC</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>C</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>TGC TGT</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>E</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>GAG GAA</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>W</TD><TD VALIGN=BASELINE ALIGN=LEFT NOWRAP>TTT</TD></TR></TABLE><P><P><BR>Note that there can be multiple nucleotide triplets which encode a single amino acid. For example, in the genetic code subset above, only the amino acid W is encoded by a single triplet. Using this genetic code subset, the DNA sequence GCTGCTCGCGATAATAATGAA encodes the protein AARDNNE.<P>Unfortunately molecular biology is nowhere near as simple as we have just described. As it turns out the DNA in your cells contains over 3 billion nucleotides, and only a fraction of your DNA actually contains genes that encode proteins. This means that genes are often embedded in long sequences of nucleotides (which need not start with triplets). So for example, the DNA sequence<P><P><BR>AAATT<SPAN CLASS="textbf">GCAGCTGCTCGCGATAATAATGAA</SPAN>TTTCGCGCGCGCGCGC<P><P><BR>contains the gene that encodes the amino acid sequence AARDNNE.<P>To make matters even worse, DNA is actually double stranded, which means when you are working with a DNA sequence the gene might be coded in the forward direction (as in the example above) or in the reverse direction. Again for example, the DNA sequence<P><P><BR>CGCGCGCGCGCGCTTT<SPAN CLASS="textbf">AAGTAATAATAGCGCTCGTCG</SPAN>ACGTTAAA<P><P><BR>also encodes the amino acid sequence AARDNNE. This time the amino acid sequence is encoded by the reverse strand.<P>Given a strand of DNA, a protein sequence, and a genetic code, you are to determine if the complete protein sequence is encoded by all or some part of the DNA sequence.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input to your program will consist of a line containing a string that gives the DNA strand, for example:<P><P><BR><TT>AAATTGCAGCTGCTCGCGATAATAATGAATTTCGCGCGCGCGCGC</TT><P><P><BR>The second line will consist of a string of alphabetic characters that gives the protein sequence, for example:<P><P><BR><TT>AARDNNE</TT><P><P><BR>The remaining lines of input will give a subset of the genetic code.

Dezider works in a large factory as a box-mover. A box-mover's job is relatively simple: every day he is presented with a huge box which he can only push but not lift. His task is to push the box from its current position to a desired location. The factory floor is covered with square tiles and from a bird's perspective it would look like a grid. The box and Dezider each occupy exactly one square. As Dezider cannot lift the box, they cannot be in the same square at the same time. Apart from the box and Dezider, some squares contain unmovable obstacles, such as walls or very heavy furniture. Neither Dezider, nor a box can walk through or step on the obstacles. Dezider can move freely on the unblocked floor -- his possible moves are ``turn right", ``turn left", and ``make a step". If there is an obstacle in front of him while attempting to make a step, he simply bounces off the obstacle and lands at the same spot where he started doing the step. If there is a box in front of him while making a step and there is no obstacle in front of the box, Dezider pushes the box (as if the box made a step forward in sync with Dezider, so he ends up facing the box again but both moved). Dezider cannot pull the box -- it is too heavy and does not have any handles. 

<P>
Your task is to help Dezider to push the box to its target location. Dezider does not mind walking around the floor but pushing the box is a real pain in the neck. So he asks you to minimize the number of steps when he pushes the box. And -- Dezider is especially interested in finding out if it is possible to move the box to its target location at all! (Sometimes, after Dezider has pushed the box around for a few days, his boss wears a rather curious expression...)

<P>Kazimir is a trash-sorting robot. Everybody (humans, that is) think he is very useful: you come to him with a list of parts needed for your new invention and he then sits by a conveyor belt which transports trash and whenever he spots the next part on your list, he picks it up, cleans it to perfection, and attaches it to the already obtained parts. Of course, every object on the conveyor belt has a different level of dirtiness. Some things take only a minute to clean while others take an hour. The conveyor belt is behind a glass wall with a window at the very front, so Kazimir can see all the objects (and their level of dirtiness) but he can reach only the very first object.<P>Kazimir's problem is that he is allergic to dirt. He strongly suspects that his current program does not minimize his exposure to the dirt -- often he finds himself cleaning an object for an hour whereas if he only waited a few minutes, he could have gotten the same object in an almost clean condition. So he asked you to reprogram him so that he spends the least possible time cleaning the objects on people's lists.<P>Kazimir has a list of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> wanted parts which he has to get in the specified order.<P>The conveyor belt is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> feet long and every object occupies one foot on the belt.<P>The speed of the belt is one foot per minute.

After running a successful bakery for years and avoiding a tax audit last year, Arnie has discovered that he has accumulated billions of dollars. In the interest of trying new things Arnie has decided to start up a new airline ``Doggone Air" that caters exclusively to dogs. Arnie being the smart business dog has decided to hire greyhounds for sleek and speedy in-flight Beggin' Strip service, as well as seasoned pit bulls to maintain order, and limit his flights so that they all take off and land at locations in the same time zone and on the same day. 

<P>
When selecting a flight dogs, unlike humans, do not care about the actual time a flight departs or arrives at its destination, they only care about the total elapsed time of a flight plan consisting of one or more flights. Second, dogs cannot travel for more than 3 hours without taking a break. So, for destinations that are further than 3 hours away, the flight plan must include a layover of at least 30 minutes, to give the passengers time to stretch their legs and find suitable trees. Finally, dogs insist on leaving and arriving on the same day. 

<P>
You are to write a program that, given the flights offered by Doggone, along with a source and destination airport, will determine whether or not a flight plan exists that meets the selection criteria in the previous paragraph.

<P>The Confusion State University business office has a policy that requires all staff traveling on business to use the most cost-effective mode of transportation possible. Cost-effective does not necessarily mean cheapest, however, as the cost of the time spent traveling is also taken into account. The State of Confusion has fairly good airline coverage, and reasonable roads, but the bus and rail transporation network leaves much to be desired in terms of availability and timely performance. Therefore, most travel of any significant distance comes down to a fly-or-drive decision.<P>It became apparent during a recent review of staff travel expenses that in some cases, it is less expensive to rent a car from the approved rental agency and pay for fuel than it is to pay for staff members to drive their personal vehicles at the IRS-approved standard mileage rate. This provides a third alternative to consider when arranging travel. The business office has retained your team to develop a program that will select the most cost-effective mode of travel when arranging trips for staff members.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Input to your program will be a series of round-trip requests. Each round-trip request will contain the following information on three lines, with fields separated from each other by single spaces:<P><OL><LI>The first line will contain a trip name (a string of 1 to 31 upper and lower-case letters, digits, and hyphens), the total one-way road mileage as an integer, and the effective hourly pay rate for the staff member in dollars and cents. </LI><LI>The second line will contain flight information: the cost of the round-trip ticket (in dollars and cents), the total one-way flight duration (in whole minutes), the integer number of miles to the airport (in the event a traveler drives his/her personal car to the airport), the total cost of airport parking (in dollars and cents), and the cost of a round-trip shuttle as an alternative to driving to/from and parking at the airport (also in dollars and cents). </LI><LI>The third line will contain rental car costs: the total rental charges (in dollars and cents) and the per-gallon cost of gasoline (also in dollars and cents). </LI></OL><P>Your program is to compute the estimated total round-trip costs for flying, driving a rental car, and driving a personal vehicle (taking into account the cost of the time spent traveling in each case). Your program is to make the following assumptions:<P><UL><LI>When staff members drive on trips (other than to and from airports), their average speed is 55 miles per hour. </LI><LI>The IRS-approved reimbursement rate is 44.5 cents per mile. </LI><LI>For flying trips, the travel time each way will be the sum of the actual flying time, the time to get to/from the originating airport, and a two hour allowance. The two hour allowance covers the time spent at airports at each end of the trip along with destination ground transporation. </LI><LI>The travel time to/from the originating airport is to be calculated using an average in-city speed of 40 miles per hour. Originating airport travel time is the same whether a traveler drives and parks his/her personal car or if a shuttle is used.

<P>The reprographic center at Swamp County High School is a sorry collection of mimeographs and aging photocopiers. Just recently, it acquired a new laser printer that can print duplex (on both sides of the paper) and 2-up (two half-size pages on one side of a sheet of paper). To show off the new capabilities, the school wants to print this year's graduation program as a booklet rather than a bunch of 8.5 by 11 inch single-sided papers stapled together. A booklet is stack of 8.5 by 11 inch papers folded in half along the 5.5 inch midline, then stapled along the fold to make a simple spine.<P>Mr. Hack, the journalism teacher and a capable editor, was unable to determine the page print order necessary to produce a booklet from a document with sequentially ordered pages. He turned to your team, the webmasters for the school's underground website, to produce a program to reorder the pages for proper printing. Given the number of sequential pages in a document, produce the required number of sheets and proper page reordering for proper printing as a 2-up duplex booklet.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2>Input to your program will be a list of document sizes (in total pages), one per line, terminated by end-of-file.

For each document size, print the number of sheets of paper required in a booklet, followed by a colon, then the page numbers to print on each separate sheet of paper. For each sheet, print a space followed by four comma-separated page numbers (without embedded whitespace), where a page number of zero indicates a blank page. The laser printer prints pages in A,B,C,D order as indicated on the diagram at the end of this problem (see figure 1). Order the sheets such that laying the sheets down with the first two pages (6,3 in the seven-page sample) showing, then the next sheet's pages showing (0,1 in the seven-page sample) produce a stack of papers with page 1 on the facing (right hand) page, ready to be stapled from the top.<center><IMG SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/37/p3750.jpg NAME="Figure 1" ALT="Diagram for Figure 1"><br>Figure 1.</center><p>A recent donation of very lightweight paper combined with a heavy duty stapler has made it possible to staple up to 50 sheets of paper together to form a booklet.

<P>A seaport container terminal stores large containers that are eventually loaded on seagoing ships for transport abroad. Containers coming to the terminal by road and rail are stacked at the terminal as they arrive.<P>Seagoing ships carry large numbers of containers. The time to load a ship depends in part on the locations of its containers. The loading time increases when the containers are not on the top of the stacks, but can be fetched only after removing other containers that are on top of them.<P>The container terminal needs a plan for stacking containers in order to decrease loading time. The plan must allow each ship to be loaded by accessing only topmost containers on the stacks, and minimizing the total number of stacks needed.<P>For this problem, we know the order in which ships must be loaded and the order in which containers arrive. Each ship is represented by a capital letter between A and Z (inclusive), and the ships will be loaded in alphabetical order. Each container is labeled with a capital letter representing the ship onto which it needs to be loaded. There is no limit on the number of containers that can be placed in a single stack.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input file contains multiple test cases.

<P>
Swamp County College is embarking on an effort to improve the management of the College's data center. The college is adopting the ITIL (Information Technology Information Library) model for IT service management. Originally developed by the British Government, ITIL covers a wide spectrum of IT service, application, and infrastructure management best practices. ITIL is now being adopted widely in both the public and private sectors worldwide. 

<P>
The college IT department has determined that it needs to improve its understanding of the infrastructure within the data center. In accordance with the ITIL model, the IT managers want to build a Configuration Management Data Base (a CMDB) that contains information about the equipment in the data center, the connections between that equipment, and the databases and software applications that run on the equipment. The objective is to be able to identify the potential impact of downtime or maintenance of one infrastructure component on the databases and applications supported by the infrastructure. 

<P>
Building a full CMDB is a major undertaking. In order to get some value out of the process quickly, and gain executive support and funding for the full project, the college is asking your team to develop a proof-of-concept database and tool that will demonstrate the basic functions of a CMDB and help them when planning upgrades to their critical infrastructure. 

<P>
This proof-of-concept database will handle the following infrastructure components and the relationships between them: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Storage Arrays 
</LI>
<LI>Storage (Fibre Channel) Switches 
</LI>
<LI>Network (IP) Switches 
</LI>
<LI>Servers 
</LI>
<LI>Databases 
</LI>
<LI>Applications 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Each of these infrastructure components is referred to by ITIL as a configuration item (CI). The database will contain a type definition of each CI and a list of relationships between them. Each CI will be defined as one of the above types (storage array, storage switch, network switch, server, database, or application). CI names are strings of between 1 and 31 upper case letters and digits, with the first character being a letter. No two CIs will have the same name. 

<P>
Relationships will be defined as connections or usage relationships between CIs; for example, a storage array connects to a storage switch, a server connects to a network switch, a server may connect to a storage switch, an application runs on a server, an application may use a database, an application may use another application, and a server may use a storage array. Databases and applications that depend on each other may reside on different servers, communicating with each other over the IP network. 

<P>
Storage switches provide connections between a server and a storage array. Every path between a server and its external storage will pass through only one storage switch. However, connections to storage arrays may be redundantÃ¢Â€Â” that is, a given server may have independent connections to multiple switches, as may a storage array. This means that there may be multiple paths between a server and a storage array. These redundant paths are used to provide additional bandwidth and redundancy, so that if one storage switch fails or is taken down for maintenance, access to storage is not interrupted. 

<P>
Similarly, servers may have connections to multiple network switches, providing multiple paths for network traffic among databases and applications. Unlike storage, there may be multiple IP switches in a path between server network ports.

<P>
Your team is to write a program that will read CMDB entries, then use the CMDB entries to answer queries about the impact that a single down CI would have on database and application CIs. 

<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
Input to your program will be a series of CI definitions, followed by a series of CI relationships, and ending with a series of queries. Each definition, relationship, and query appears on a line by itself, with the fields separated from each other by one or more spaces. No input line will exceed 80 columns. 

<P>
Each CI will be defined on a line containing the string ``<TT>CI</TT>", the CI name, and the type: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>storage-array 
</LI>
<LI>storage-switch 
</LI>
<LI>network-switch 
</LI>
<LI>server 
</LI>
<LI>database 
</LI>
<LI>application 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Each relationship will be defined on a line containing the string ``<TT>RE</TT>", a CI, the type of relationship (as listed below), and another CI. The relationship definitions are as follows:

The CI relationships will be fully definedÃ¢Â€Â”there will be no missing paths between components. Each application and database runs on only one server. Any application may use the services of several other applications and databases. 

<P>
Queries to the CMDB will begin with ``<TT>??</TT>" followed by a CI that has failed or is scheduled for maintenance.

<P>
Your program is to print the CI being queried, followed by a list of database and application CIs that would be affected. The CI being queried is to be printed on a line with the string ``<TT>Query:</TT>" starting in the first column, followed by a single space and the name of the CI. The affected database CIs are to be printed next, each on a separate line that begins with ``<TT>Database:</TT>" followed by a single space and the affected CI name. Applications are to be listed last, using the same formatÃ¢Â€Â”each on a separate line that begins with ``<TT>Application:</TT>" followed by a single space and the affected CI name. The database and application CIs should be listed in ASCII lexical order. The lines containing affected CI names are to begin in the fourth column. If a CI is listed because it is in a degraded state, print an asterisk in the third column. 

<P>
A CMDB storage switch query is to report that the databases and applications running on a given server are running in a degraded state if the server can reach all its storage on one or more other paths. Should such a server lose all connectivity to a storage array it uses, all databases and applications running on that server will be down. If a server should lose a network connection that affects needed connectivity for applications that run on the server, those applications will be degraded or down (based on the availability of other network paths). 

<P>
Your proof-of-concept implementation is to have the capacity to handle 250 CI definitions and 1,000 CI relationships.

BigOh Corporation is expanding into Swamp County by building a new datacenter housing thousands of powerful server computers. Operating a datacenter requires a significant amount of electrical power, which is a particular challenge given Swamp County's poor infrastructure. Given Swamp County's sub-tropical location, one thing the county does have in large amounts is sunshine. BigOh, being an environmentally responsible company, is exploring the possibility of building and operating a completely solar-powered datacenter. Your task is to help estimate the feasibility of such a datacenter under various conditions. 

<P>
Given a four-day sunlight forecast, information about the solar panels and the servers, and a list of jobs to process, your team is to write a program that will determine if the requested jobs can be completed without running out of power. 

<P>
The four-day sunlight forecast consists of four input lines with one-day forecasts, each of which consists of a day name, sunrise time, sunset time, and cloud index floating point value between 0.000 and 1.000, separated from each other by whitespace. Times are specified on a 24-hour clock, so, for example, 1:00 PM would be written as 13:00. Day names will be single words of no more than 20 characters. 

<P>
The solar panels in the solar array are all flat, unobstructed, and aligned to be perpendicular to the sun at noon. On a day with exactly 12 hours of sunlight and a cloud index of 0.000, the solar panel array will collect 100 kilowatt hours (kWh). The amount of power collected scales linearly with the sunshine duration and cloud index. For example, on a day with 15-hours of sunshine and a cloud index of 0.5, the array would generate 62.5 kWh. No power at all is collected before dawn or after sunset. 

<P>
Power flows from the solar panel arrays to a high-capacity battery system. This battery system has a large capacity, but it is still limited to a given number of output kWh. The battery system also loses a certain percentage of the power put into it. For example, a battery system that has a maximum output capacity of 100 kWh and is 80<SPAN CLASS="MATH">%</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> efficient would have an output of 100 kWh if and only if the solar panel arrays generated at least 125 kWh that day. The battery system capacity in kWh and efficiency percentage will be specified on one input line after the forecast, separated by whitespace. 

<P>
To protect the capacity of the batteries over their lifetime, the entire battery system is completely drained just before dawn each day. To minimize overheating, the servers operate only during the cool late-night hours. The servers are fast enough to do all needed work between sunset and midnight, so the time needed to execute each job will not be a limiting factorÃ¢Â€Â”only the power consumed matters. 

<P>
Each processing job is a massively parallel task that all servers work on as a group, and only one job may be active at any moment in time. Each job must run to completion in a single night. Some jobs are independent of other jobs, while others can only be run after some other job has produced needed output. 

<P>

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
The program input may specify from one to ten jobs. Each job is described by one line with a unique upper-case letter ID, the kWh of power needed to complete the job as a floating point value, the IDs of zero or more prerequisite jobs, and a human-readable string inside quotation marks that describes the purpose of the job. These fields are separated from each other by whitespace.

<H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
Your program should determine a four-day job schedule. Your program's output is to be a single line with the job IDs in the order in which the jobs should be run, with the days separated from each other by vertical-bar characters. If there are multiple possible schedules, print the one which is lexigraphically first in ASCII. If there is no possible schedule that will allow all jobs to complete without running out of power, your program should instead print one line: ``<TT>Insufficent sunlight for requested jobs.</TT>" If the input specifies dependencies between jobs that contain a cycle or a dependency on a non-existent job, print the line ``<TT>Invalid job dependencies.</TT>"

<P>A web <SPAN CLASS="textit">template engine</SPAN> is a software that is designed to process web templates and content information to produce web documents.

<P>SAHARA is a two player board game played on a hexagon-shaped grid made out of 54 triangles as the one shown in Figure (a). Each player has 6 (tetraeder) pyramids, initially placed as seen Figure (b). Player one has the dark pyramids, player two has the lighter ones. The players take turns in moving one of their own pyramids. A pyramid is moved by tipping the pyramid on its side into an adjacent space. For example, a pyramid at location 11 can be moved to location 3, 10, or 12 (assuming the destination location is free.)<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="458" HEIGHT="447" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/37/3759img1.png ALT="\epsfbox{p3759a.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="460" HEIGHT="447" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/37/3759img1.png ALT="\epsfbox{p3759b.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>The objective of the game is to trap a pyramid of the opponent. A pyramid is trapped if it can't be moved. For example, a pyramid at location 11 is trapped if locations 3, 10, and 12 are all occupied (regardless of which player's pyramids occupy these locations.) Similarly, a pyramid at location 28 is trapped if both locations 17 and 29 are occupied. For example, in Figure (c) on the next page, player one can win the game by moving his pyramid from location 30 to location 29 and thus trapping the opponent's pyramid at location 28.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="458" HEIGHT="460" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/37/3759img1.png ALT="\epsfbox{p3759c.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="460" HEIGHT="447" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/37/3759img1.png ALT="\epsfbox{p3759d.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>Write a program that determines if the first player can trap an opponent's pyramid in a single move.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Your program will be tested on one or more test cases.

<P><SPAN CLASS="textit">Johnny hates Number Theory!</SPAN> Actually, back in 2002, we came to know that Johnny couldn't count and in 2005 we knew that Johnny couldn't yet add. (But we did know in 2003 that Johnny was street smart enough to solve difficult graph problems!) Why Johnny decided to study Number Theory is incomprehensible to us.<P>Anyhow, back to Johnny.

<P>A-to-Z is a game usually played by kids in elementary schools to help them improve their spelling skills and to enrich their vocabulary. The game comes with a set of words, each word written on a piece of plastic. Children challenge each other by picking two letters (let's call them <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) and then trying to <SPAN CLASS="textit">connect</SPAN> these letters by finding a sequence of one or more words (we'll refer to them as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>W</I><SUB>2</SUB>,..., <I>W</I><SUB>n</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) where the first word <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> starts with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and the last word <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I><SUB>n</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> ends with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Each two consecutive words in the sequence ( <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I><SUB>i</SUB>, <I>W</I><SUB>i+1</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) must overlap with at least two letters. Word <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> overlaps by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> letters with word <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> if the last <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> letters of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> are the same as the first <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> letters of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> .

<P>You must have heard of the great mathematician <SPAN CLASS="textit">Leonardo da Pisa Fibonacci</SPAN> (1170-1240). Among the many algorithms that he described in his <SPAN CLASS="textit">Liber Abaci</SPAN> book, (which was first published in 1202,) Fibonacci described the <SPAN CLASS="textit">Casting Out Nines</SPAN> procedure for checking out addition, subtraction, and multiplication. According to historians, the procedure was transmitted to Europe by the Arabs, but was probably developed somewhere on the Indian subcontinent and is therefore sometimes also called ``<SPAN CLASS="textit">the Hindu check.</SPAN>"<P>``<SPAN CLASS="textit">Casting out nines</SPAN>" is an elementary check of a multiplication which makes use of the congruence <SPAN CLASS="MATH">10<SUP>x</SUP> <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/37/3763img1.png ALT="$ \equiv$"> 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> (mod 9).

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>of a fully laden swallow? This fearful question was posed to the intrepid band of Grail searchers. Their response of ``African or European?" was partly correct. The air speed would most definitely depend on the sub-species of swallow. King Arthur, fearing more intense questioning in this vein, ordered his royal mathematicians to determine the air speed of a fully laden swallow Ã¢Â€Â“ both African and European. 

<P>
The mathematicians called upon the royal birders to capture a number of swallows of both types, lade them fully, and then release them from point A and time their arrival at point B. Since they didn't want to confuse their figures, the European and African swallows were each started from a different location, so that each group flew a different distance, but all swallows in the same group flew the same distance. They then asked the royal map-makers to determine the distance (measured in furlongs) between the two starting points and the finish point. Using 10 swallows of each type, the royal mathematicians would then compute the average air speed for each group. 

<P>
However, the royal mathematicians were somewhat lazy. After gathering all the data, they decided it was MUCH too hard to do all those nasty calculations by hand. So, they quickly constructed a time machine and have come into the future to enlist your help: they need you to write a program to do the calculations, which they will then take back into the past with them. Thus the searchers of the Grail will be saved from certain doom, (should this dastardly question be posed again), and you will go down in history as a hero. (Well, maybe not history, since they are from the past, so maybe you'll go down in futurory?) 

<P>
There's one tricky bit (you knew it was coming): the royal mathematicians cannot agree on exactly how the average should be calculated. Some believe that, for each group, one should add up all of the times and then divide the total distance covered by all the swallows of that type by the total time (this is method 1). Others are of the opinion that the average speed is determined by computing the speed for each swallow, summing those values and then dividing that total by the total number of swallows (this is method 2). Your program should compute the average both ways, to avoid a nasty falling out among the royal mathematicians. 

<P>
The input provided by the royal mathematicians is somewhat disorganized Ã¢Â€Â“ the two breeds' times have been intermixed and they weren't too careful about capitalization. But each entry is on a separate line and marked with an `<TT>A</TT>' or `<TT>a</TT>' or `<TT>E</TT>' or `<TT>e</TT>' to aid in identification. Each line begins with this single letter, followed by a single space. The final datum on the line is the elapsed time the swallow flew, expressed in hours. Since the time-keeping of the era wasn't very accurate, this value is simply a real number <SPAN CLASS="MATH">( &gt; 0)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> with a single level of precision, such as 1.5 (one and a half hours), or 0.4 (four-tenths of an hour).

Holy Hand Grenades have found multiple uses throughout history. Most notably, King Arthur did use a Holy Hand Grenade (HHG) to dispatch a vicious rabbit which was guarding the entrance to a cave. The instructions for its use are in the Book of Armaments (Chapter 2, verses 9-21), and are read as follows:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">``First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then, shalt thou count to three. No more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it." Amen.</SPAN>

<P>
Unfortunately, the Book of Armaments faileth to mention that the HHG must come to a complete stop (i.e. rest stably) before it can explodeth and blow a rabbit to tiny bits. As long as it rolleth or wobbeleth, it refuseth to explodeth. Unknown is the reason why the authors of the Book of Armaments neglected to mention this pertinent fact. Further complicating matters, different HHGs have different radii of destruction (<SPAN  CLASS="textit">RD</SPAN>). Once a HHG resteth stably, and explodeth, everything within or equal to its <SPAN  CLASS="textit">RD</SPAN> shalt be snuffed out. Presumably, this is what happened to the rabbit with big, pointy teeth; however, there remaineth some controversy over this matter. Because of this controversy, the king hath decreed a simulation to be run that may possibly answer this question. 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Your task is to determine the result of the grenade's explosion. 
</LI>
<LI>The grenade must always be at rest in order to detonate. All HHGs have a radius R=1 and a variable radius of destruction (RD). At the instant of detonation, the rabbit could be mid-leap, on the ground, or underground. 
</LI>
<LI>For each simulation the terrain remaineth unchanged. It consisteth of two intersecting curves, <!-- MATH
 $y = e^{-x}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I> = <I>e</I><SUP>-x</SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I> = <I>ln</I>(<I>x</I>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> as we have revealed unto you in the illustrious illustration. The curves reside in the plane formed by the rabbit, the grenade, and the center of the earth. The terrain is impervious to detonations, and changeth not between tests. 
</LI>
<LI>If a bunny's center of mass is strictly below the ground level (as denoted by the intersecting curves) when a HHG explodeth, that bunny shalt remaineth un-snuffedeth and thus shalt live to bite another day. 
</LI>
<LI>If the bunny resideth strictly outside of the range of a stably resting HHG's radius of destruction, that bunny shalt also remain un-snuffedeth out. 
</LI>
<LI>Each result shalt be dependent upon computations accurate even unto 8 significant figures. 
</LI>
<LI>There shalt not be an input value smaller even than 1.0E-15 or greater even than 1.0E+15. 
</LI>
<LI>Because the bunny's center of mass doth be its location, a bunny might possibly end up inside both the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">RD</SPAN> and the R=1 of a HHG. This simply means the bunny is curled around the grenade. If the center of mass of such a bunny be strictly inside the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">RD</SPAN> it shall most surely be snuffÃƒÂ©d out. Amen.

After each commission to install a shrubbery, Roger the Shrubber has to transport many empty planting boxes with a drawn cart. In this instance, a planting box is a wooden box with one open side. 

<P>
Given a set of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> planting boxes, compute the largest number of boxes that can be nested. Specifically, report the number of the largest subset of boxes which may be nested such that the smallest box of the subset fits within the second smallest, the second smallest of the subset fits within the third smallest, the third smallest of the subset fits within the fourth smallest, and so forth. 

<P>
A box <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I>(<I>b</I><SUB>i</SUB>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> fits into box <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I>(<I>b</I><SUB>j</SUB>)</SPAN>

If no boxes can be nested, then the size of the subset is just 1.<P>Naturally, each box in the set from which you can choose has three dimensions.

Lisa looked at the tables then said ``No no no, that's not right, I've done more." Bart pointed at the statistics and said, ``Numbers don't lie." Lisa said, ``But look, I've done 5 chores and you've only done 4. You just look good because you always run away before somebody asks you to do something. The total should give me 55% of the total chores done right." Bart laughed and ran away. Now Lisa needs your help to show the unfairness of these chore evaluations. She wants a program which computes the averages over the entire dataset and displays where the before and after averages support the opposite hypothesis than would be indicated by considering the total dataset. To be fair, she only wants to consider record keeping times when both she and Bart have chores assigned both before and after the record keeping.

In all the annals of knighthood, no personality trait has been in more dire need than the fortitude to withstand the diplomatically deleterious effects of a vicious, relentless taunting. Tasked with strengthening the mental endurance of Camelot's knights, King Arthur's court decided that instructional taunting must be applied, yet it could not be delivered by the chivalrous administration. Thus, Sir Lancelot commanded a local anarcho-syndicalist peasant to write a program that generates taunts (a.k.a. mudslinging) thereby producing a script to test the patience of knights in a training environment. To prevent unbridled creativity in taunting from spoiling the otherwise stately proceedings of a nobleman's education, the following rules designed by committee (The Round Table) must be adhered to:

<P>
<PRE>
&lt;taunt&gt; ::= &lt;sentence&gt; | &lt;taunt&gt; &lt;sentence&gt; | &lt;noun&gt;! | &lt;sentence&gt; 
&lt;sentence&gt; ::= &lt;past-rel&gt; &lt;noun-phrase&gt; | &lt;present-rel&gt; &lt;noun-phrase&gt; | &lt;past-rel&gt; &lt;article&gt; &lt;noun&gt; 
&lt;noun-phrase&gt; ::= &lt;article&gt; &lt;modified-noun&gt; 
&lt;modified-noun&gt; ::= &lt;noun&gt; | &lt;modifier&gt; &lt;noun&gt; 
&lt;modifier&gt; ::= &lt;adjective&gt; | &lt;adverb&gt; &lt;adjective&gt; 
&lt;present-rel&gt; ::= your &lt;present-person&gt; &lt;present-verb&gt; 
&lt;past-rel&gt; ::= your &lt;past-person&gt; &lt;past-verb&gt; 
&lt;present-person&gt; ::= steed | king | first-born 
&lt;past-person&gt; ::= mother | father | grandmother | grandfather | godfather 
&lt;noun&gt; ::= hamster | coconut | duck | herring | newt | peril | chicken | vole | parrot | mouse | twit 
&lt;present-verb&gt; ::= is | Ã¢Â€Âœmasquerades asÃ¢Â€Â� 
&lt;past-verb&gt; ::= was | personified 
&lt;article&gt; ::= a 
&lt;adjective&gt; ::= silly | wicked | sordid | naughty | repulsive | malodorous | ill-tempered 
&lt;adverb&gt; ::= conspicuously | categorically | positively | cruelly | incontrovertibly
</PRE><SMALL CLASS="FOOTNOTESIZE"> 
</SMALL>
<P>
Note that all phrases in double quotes are to be treated as one word for taunt simulation output. 

<P>
The number of taunts elicited at any given time is derived from the number of words spoken by the knight. For every three words (or fraction thereof) delivered by the knight, the generator produces one or more taunts in a theater-style script format. In the event that 2 taunts must be produced on a single line, they will be counted as 2 taunts towards the total required. By a mandate from the masses, a word will always contain at least one alphabetic character, and will be separated from other words by at least 1 space. 

<P>
In exception to the above rules, whenever the program finds the holy grail, which is to say, the letters t-h-e-h-o-l-y-g-r-a-i-l (case insensitive) in that order in a line of input, then the first taunt generated will be displayed by the program as ``(A childish hand gesture)". 

<P>
To ensure all royal quality assurance criteria are met, the program must be demonstrated by a simulation showing the taunts produced from a series of inputs. Each taunt is generated by applying the taunt generation rules until all of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&lt;...&gt;</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> have been replaced with appropriate words. In most cases, you will face a choice of alternate rules for expanding a phrase name. In these cases, you should make a choice as follows: Suppose that this is the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th such choice that you have faced for that rule since the start of program execution, and that you must choose one of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> rules for expanding a given kind of phrase. Let the rules for that phrase be numbered from <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1...<I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> in the order of appearance above, and then choose rule number <!-- MATH
 $((k-1) \bmod n) + 1$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">((<I>k</I> - 1) mod <I>n</I>) + 1</SPAN>

<P>
Candy and his friends found a treasure map. With the help of the map, they successfully found the treasure inside an ancient cave, but just as they took the large treasure box, the cave started to collapse! 

<P>
Candy must find a way out, but the rocks are falling down so quickly that it's impossible to run out with bare feet. After carefully examined the treasure box, they found a digit panel, a button, and a small piece of paper. ``I am not an ordinary treasure box, I am a mini-spaceship, your last hope to escape. Use the digit panel to setup my speed, then press the button to launch. I'll fly from left to right, until I reach the exit. The trouble is: I am very weak. I'll explode immediately when hit by any falling rock, but if I'm just touching one, it's ok. When flying, I burn the treasures inside. The higher my speed is, the more treasures I will burn. Thus, be sure to find an appropriate speed before starting your journey. The last thing you need to know is: don't be too slow. The exit will be blocked after a while."

<P>When a student is too tired, he can't help sleeping in class, even if his favorite teacher is right here in front of him. Imagine you have a class of extraordinarily tired students, how long do you have to wait, before all the students are listening to you and won't sleep any more? In order to complete this task, you need to understand how students behave.<P>When a student is awaken, he struggles for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> minutes listening to the teacher (after all, it's too bad to sleep all the time). After that, he counts the number of awaken and sleeping students (including himself). If there are strictly more sleeping students than awaken students, he sleeps for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> minutes. Otherwise, he struggles for another <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> minutes, because he knew that when there is only very few sleeping students, there is a big chance for them to be punished! Note that a student counts the number of sleeping students only when he wants to sleep again.<P>Now that you understand each student could be described by two integers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the length of awaken and sleeping period. If there are always more sleeping students, these two periods continue again and again. We combine an awaken period with a sleeping period after it, and call the combined period an awaken-sleeping period. For example, a student with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I> = 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I> = 4</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> has an awaken-sleeping period of awaken-sleeping-sleeping-sleeping-sleeping.

<P>Gargoyles can trace their history back many thousands of years to ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome.

<P>
If you're not familiar with music, take a look at the picture above. The vertical position of a note determines its name, which is one of C, D, E, F, G, A and B, in this problem (yes, you don't have to consider notes in other octaves). Consecutive lines in the staff have the same vertical distances. We call it one standard distance (sd), which is always between 1.0 and 5.0. For example, C and E are 1sd apart, and D and B are 2.5sd. The horizontal order of the notes determines how the sequence is played (or sung). The exact horizontal positions do not matter, as long as the relative order is preserved. But since I never write down ugly scores, you can safely assume that the horizontal distance of an arbitrary pair of neighboring notes is at least 1sd and at most 5sd.

<P>Iceman was in a room in Iceland. He wants to get out of it, but it's not as easy as it seems. To help him, you need to know something about Iceland and Iceman.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="294" HEIGHT="319" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/37/p3789.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p3789.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">Fig 1. The iceman in the room</DIV><P>The room could be described by an <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> <TT>*</TT> <I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> grid, so there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> rows numbered 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> from top to bottom, each with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> squares numbered 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> from left to right. Each square may be empty, icy or rocky. An empty square is denoted by `<TT>.</TT>', while a rocky square is denoted by `<TT>X</TT>'. Ice squares are a bit complex, so we talk about it later. The first and last rows and columns are all rocky. The iceman's initial location is always an empty square at the beginning, denoted by `'. His destination is also empty at the beginning, denoted by `<TT>#</TT>'. What's more, the destination is always directly above a rocky square. Though the iceman looks bigger than a square, he always occupies exactly one single empty square.<P>The iceman has four kinds of moves: go left (<TT>L</TT>), go right (<TT>R</TT>), magic wind left (<code>&lt;</code>) and magic wind right (<code>&gt;</code>). Suppose the iceman is at <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I>, <I>c</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, then `<code>&lt;</code>' move operates on the iceman's bottom-left square <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I> + 1, <I>c</I> - 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. If the square is rocky, the move does nothing; if the square is empty, it becomes icy; if the square is icy, it becomes empty. There are four kinds of icy squares: ice with two free-ends (<TT>O</TT>), ice with left free-end (<TT>[</TT>), ice with right free-end (<TT>]</TT>), ice with no free-end (<TT>=</TT>). Here `free' means `not connected'. If an icy square is created by a magic-wind move, it connects to its left/right neighbor, provided the corresponding neighboring square is not empty (rocky or icy). The connections between neighboring squares are symmetric, so squares that are connected to each other behave as a whole. Connections could be created only by magic moves, and there are no vertical connections. We call the whole an ice bar. If an icy bar (no matter how many squares does it contain) has two free ends, we call it a free ice bar. Free ice bars immediate drop down vertically when all its supporting squares (squares directly below it) are empty. When an icy square is cleared, all connections of it (if any) are destroyed. Because rocky squares are fixed, if an ice bar connects to one or two rocky squares, it never drops down until its connections to rocky squares are all destroyed. The `<code>&gt;</code>' move is symmetrical.<P>The `<TT>L</TT>' move is a little bit complex, compared to what you might expect. Again, suppose the iceman is located at <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I>, <I>c</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. If <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I>, <I>c</I> - 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is an empty square, the iceman go there. Now he stands on the square <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I> + 1, <I>c</I> - 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, which might be empty. If this is true, he falls down until the square under him is not empty. The iceman can launch a move only when he's standing on a rocky or icy square, so when falling down, he cannot do anything. Now consider the second case, i.e. <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I>, <I>c</I> - 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is rocky. Obviously the iceman cannot move to that square, so he checks the square above it and the square above himself (i.e the squares <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I> - 1, <I>c</I> - 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I> - 1, <I>c</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>). If both are empty, he climbs to <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I> - 1, <I>c</I> - 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, otherwise he remains at <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I>, <I>c</I>)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The third and last case holds when <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I>, <I>c</I> - 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is icy. In this case, the iceman tries to push it. The Iceman is not so powerful, so he can only push single <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(1&#215;1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> icy squares. That is, if only if <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I>, <I>c</I> - 2)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is empty, the ice at <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I>, <I>c</I> - 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is pushed left. It continues to move left until it is blocked by a rocky or icy square, or the square directly below is empty. In the latter case, the ice drops down, as stated before. Note that when stopped dropping, the ice does not move left again. Don't forget that when the ice is pushed away successfully, some free ice bars may drop down. The iceman does not move until everything stopped moving or dropping. If the ice at <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>r</I>, <I>c</I> - 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> cannot be pushed, it is treated as a rocky square, so the iceman may climb on it.<P>Write a program to move the iceman to the destination with minimum number of moves.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of several test cases.

<P>Barry Bennett, the coach of the Bings football team, wants to arrange his team for an important match against the Bangs. He decides on the formation he wants to play, for example 4-4-2, meaning that there will be four defenders, four midfielders, and two strikers (and of course, one goalkeeper). Your task is to determine the players who will play. For each available player, we know his role (e.g. midfielder). For each role, the players are selected in ascending order of their numbers. When the players are selected, you must determine the captain too, who is the player with the longest record in the team play. In case two players have the same record, the one with bigger number is chosen. Note that the captain is chosen among the players that are selected in the arrange.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input consists of multiple test cases.

<P>The rules for calculating the taxi fares are quite complex. Many factors are to be considered in computing the taxi fares, including the length of the trip, the time of the day, the speed, etc. Every morning Bianca Bennett uses taxi to get to her office, she thinks if taximeters are programmed correctly. One day, she decided to write a program to calculate the taxi fares to check this.<P>Imagine a taxi passes through a sequence of streets <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>S</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>S</I><SUB>2</SUB>,..., <I>S</I><SUB>n</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> in order.

Back to year 3024, humans finally developed a new technology that enables them to conquer the alien races. The new technology made it possible to produce huge spaceships known as Saber Tooth spaceships as powerful as the aliens' defending mammoths. At that time, humans ruled several planets while some others were under control of the aliens. Using Saber Tooth ships, humans finally defeated aliens and this became the first Planet War in history. Our goal is to run a simulation of the ancient war to verify some historical hypotheses. 

<P>
Producing each spaceship takes an amount of time which is constant for each planet but may vary among different planets. We call the number of spaceships each planet can produce in a year, the <!-- MATH
 $production \  rate$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>production</I>&nbsp;<I>rate</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> of that planet. Note that each planet has a number of spaceships in it initially (before the simulation starts). The planets start producing  ships when the simulation starts, so if a planet has <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> ships initially, and has the production rate <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, it will have <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> + <I>p</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> ships at the beginning of year 1, and <!-- MATH
 $n + i \times p$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> + <I>i</I>&#215;<I>p</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> ships at the beginning of year <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (years are started from zero).

<P>
Bradley Bennett, the commander in chief of the human armies, decided a strategy for the war. For each alien planet A, he chooses a corresponding human planet P, and produces spaceships in P until a certain moment at which he sends all spaceships in P to invade the planet A. No alien planet is invaded by two human planets and no human planet sends its spaceships to two different alien planets. 

<P>
The defense power of the alien planets comes from their powerful mammoths. Each alien planet contains a number of mammoths initially and produces a number of mammoths each year (called the production rate of the planet). When a fight between spaceships and mammoths takes place, the side having the greater number of troops is the winner. If the spaceships win, the alien planet is defeated. In case the number of mammoths and spaceships are equal, the spaceships win.

<P>
The difficulty with planning this strategy is that it takes some time for the spaceships to reach the alien planets, and during this time, the aliens produce mammoths. The time required for spaceships to travel from each human planet to each alien planet is known. The ships can leave their planets only at the beginning of years (right after the ships are produced) and reach the alien planets at the beginning of years too (right after the mammoths are produced). 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
As an example, consider a human planet with two initial spaceships and production rate three invading an alien planet with two initial mammoths and production rate two. The time required to travel between the two planets is two years and the ships are ordered to leave at year one. In this case, five ships leave the human planet. When they reach the alien planet, they confront eight mammoths and will be defeated during the fight.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Bennett decided to prepare a plan that destroys every alien planet in the shortest possible time. Your task is to write a program to generate such a plan. The output is the shortest possible time (in years) in which every alien planet is defeated.

Another boring Friday afternoon, Betty the Beetle thinks how to amuse herself. She goes out of her hiding place to take a walk around the living room in Bennett's house. Mr. and Mrs. Bennett are out to the theatre and there is a chessboard on the table! "The best time to practice my chessboard dance," Betty thinks! She gets so excited that she does not note that there are some pieces left on the board and starts the practice session! She has a script showing her how to move on the chessboard. The script is a sequence like the following example:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<!-- MATH
 $\epsfbox{p3796a.eps}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="255" HEIGHT="243" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/37/p3796a.jpg
 ALT="\epsfbox{p3796a.eps}">
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>
</DIV>

<P>
At each instant of time Betty, stands on a square of the chessboard, facing one of the four directions (up, down, left, right) when the board is viewed from the above. Performing a ``move <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>" instruction, she moves <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> squares forward in her current direction. If moving <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> squares goes outside the board, she stays at the last square on the board and does not go out. There are three types of turns: turn right, turn left, and turn back, which change the direction of Betty. Note that turning does not change the position of Betty.

<P>
If Betty faces a chess piece when moving, she pushes that piece, together with all other pieces behind (a tough beetle she is!). This may cause some pieces fall of the edge of the chessboard, but she doesn't care! For example, in the following figure, the left board shows the initial state and the right board shows the state after performing the script in the above example. Upper-case and lower-case letters indicate the white and black pieces respectively. The arrow shows the position of Betty along with her direction. Note that during the first move, the black king (r) falls off the right edge of the board!

The square from which Betty starts dancing is specified by one of the four characters <TT>&lt;</TT>, <TT>&gt;</TT>, <code>^</code>, and <TT>v</TT> which also indicates her initial direction (left, right, up, and down respectively). Note that the input is not necessarily a valid chess game status.

<P>
The script comes immediately after the board. It consists of several lines (between 0 and 1000). In each line, there is one instruction in one of the following formats (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>

There is going to be a voting at FIPA (Federation Internationale de Programmation Association) to determine the host of the next IPWC (International Programming World Cup). Benjamin Bennett, the delegation of Diamondland to FIPA, is trying to seek other delegation's support for a vote in favor of hosting IPWC in Diamondland. Ben is trying to buy the votes by diamond gifts. He has figured out the voting price of each and every country. However, he knows that there is no need to diamond-bribe every country, since there are small poor countries that take vote orders from their respected superpowers. So, if you bribe a country, you have gained the vote of any other country under its domination (both directly and via other countries domination).  For example, if C is under domination of B, and B is under domination of A, one may get the vote of all three countries just by bribing A. Note that no country is under domination of more than one country, and the domination relationship makes no cycle. You are to help him, against a big diamond, by writing a program to find out the minimum number of diamonds needed such that at least <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> countries vote in favor of Diamondland. Since Diamondland is a candidate, it stands out of the voting process.

A hash sign (<code>#</code>) which can appear only on the boundary of the map indicates a gate without a dynamite pack. An uppercase letter on the boundary shows a gate with a pack of dynamites. The letter A shows there is one dynamite in the pack, B shows there are two dynamite in the pack and so on. All other characters on the boundary of the map are asterisks. Corridors are indicated by dots (<TT>.</TT>). There is a blank line after each test case. The width and the height of the map are at least 3 and at most 100 characters. The last line of the input contains two dash characters (<TT>-</TT>).<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>For each test case, write a single line containing a number showing the minimum number of days it takes Bob to reach the treasure, if possible.

<P>Players in the Hermes sports complex are wearing jerseys imprinted with natural numbers. There are even number of players. During their practice session they were asked to form a circular chain. The players have done so but with a mathematical charm.

<P>Mickie likes snowboarding. That's not very surprising, since snowboarding is really great. The bad thing is that in order to gain speed, the area must slope downwards. Another disadvantage is that when you've reached the bottom of the hill you have to walk up again or wait for the ski-lift.<P>Mickie and his friend Minnie are on a snowboarding adventure. Minnie offers to pay Mickie in thousands of dollars equivalent to the number of points he covers. But she poses a constraint: during his ride he should not choose a point whose height value is co-prime to the current point's height. (Two integers are co-prime if they do not have a common factor e.g. 14 and 15.)<P>Mickie has urgently called you over phone and pleads you to help him in his challenge. He would like to know how long the longest run in an area is. That area is given by a grid of numbers, defining the heights at those points. Look at this example:<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"></DIV><PRE>

A popular word puzzle asks you to punctuate the following word sequence so that it makes sense. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
``James while John had had had had had had had had had had had a better effect on the teacher."

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The answer is: James, while John had had ``had", had had ``had had"; ``had had" had had a better effect on the teacher. 

<P>
Similarly, number sequences that don't make sense by themselves can be made into correct equations by the addition of appropriate arithmetic operators and the = sign. 

<P>
For example, 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
5 7 4 = 3 is more meaningful when written as 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
5 + 7 / 4 = 3. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
We would like you to write a program to insert appropriate operators (<SPAN CLASS="MATH">+</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">-</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>*</TT></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>) into the integer sequences supplied by us so that each sequence is transformed into a mathematically correct equation. 

<P>
Each number in the input sequence must be used exactly once, but each operator may be used zero to many times. The expression should be read from left to right, with the output of the first operation being input of the second and so on, to calculate the target number. It is possible that no expression can generate the target number. It is also possible that many expressions can generate the target number. In this case, the 'correct' solution will be the one where the operator sequence is in `alphabetic' order, where + comes first, then -, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>*</TT></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and / in that order. E.g. 1 + 1 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><TT>*</TT></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> 1 comes before 1 + 1 / 1.

<P>
There are three restrictions on the composition of the mathematical expression:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>the numbers in the expression must appear in the same order as they appear in the input. 
</LI>
<LI>you are only allowed to use / in the expression when the result of the / operator will give a remainder of zero. Division by 0 is not allowed.
</LI>
<LI>you are only allowed to use an operator in the expression if its result after applying that operator is an integer from <!-- MATH
 $(-32000 \ldots +32000)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(- 32000...+ 32000)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The outer limits of this interval are not allowed.

<P>One of the greatest epics in Indian history is Mahabharat. In this epic, Shakuni plays a key role by intimidating Dhuryodhana to go against the Pandavas resulting in the Great War. The story that still remains hidden is what causes Shakuni to intimidate Dhuryodhana resulting the down fall of Dhuryodhana. Shakuni himself unfolds the story for us:<P>I was born along with one hundred brothers and enjoyed a huge amount of wealth. Dhuryodhana had an eye over my wealth and wanted to capture it, so he imprisoned me and my brothers. He provided food and water sufficient for only one person. Since, I was the most intelligent of the lot and was keen to take revenge on him, I decided to make sure that I got the food needed to survive. So I framed an idea to get the food.<P>The idea was to form a circle consisting of me and my brothers and then eliminating the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th person from the circle stating he will not be eligible for the food. The last person still left in the circle would get the food and water. I always made sure that I got the food and water. Also, I wanted to make sure that none of my brothers recognize the pattern of elimination, so I kept changing the value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> every day.<P>Assume yourself to be the modern-world Shakuni equipped with computers, write a program to obtain the food for yourself given the number of brothers (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) and the elimination number (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>).<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The standard input consists of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> (at most 5) test cases.

In this problem, you will compute how many water packets you need to purchase for a trip across the jungle on foot. 

<P>
At your starting location, you can purchase water packets at the general store and you can buy an unlimited amount of fruits available at the general store. The jungle contains trees with edible fruits only in specific locations. At each such location, you can collect as many fruits as you like and you can store water packets for later use. You can also purchase water packets for later use from the store. You will be given the coordinates of the store (starting location), location of trees that have edible fruits, and your destination in a two-dimensional coordinate system where the unit distance is one mile. 

<P>
For each mile that you walk, you must consume one packet of water and one fruit. 

<P>
Assume that these supplies are consumed continuously, so if you walk for a partial mile you will consume partial units of water and fruit. You are unable to walk unless you have supplies of both water and fruit. You must consume the supplies while you are walking, not while you are resting under the tree. Of course, there is a limit to the total amount of water packets and fruits that you can carry. This limit is expressed as your carrying capacity in total units (1 water packet or 1 fruit is 1 unit). At no time can the sum of the water packets and the fruits that you are carrying exceed this capacity. 

<P>
You must compute minimum number of water packets you need to purchase at the store in order to reach the destination. 

<P>
You need not have any water packet or fruit left when you arrive at the destination. Since the general store has only one million water packets available, the amount of water you should buy will be an integer greater than zero and less than or equal to one million.

<P>Peg solitaire is a classical puzzle (originating in France in the late 17th century) commonly played on a 33-hole cross-shaped board (also called ``the English Board") .In England it is known as ``Solitaire", but in the U.S. most people think of this as a card game so it is usually called ``Peg Solitaire". Other people know it as ``Hi-Q" because a popular version of the game sells under that trade name.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">=6in <IMG WIDTH="971" HEIGHT="639" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/3805img1.png ALT="\epsfbox{p3805.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>The basic game consists of a cross-shaped board, usually made of wood, together with a set of 32 pegs. To start the game, one fills the board with pegs except for the central hole. A jump consists of jumping one peg over another into an empty spot in the board, removing the peg jumped over from the board. Diagonal jumps are not allowed (in the standard version of the game). The goal is to choose a sequence of jumps and finish with as few pegs as possible, ideally a single peg in the center.<P>Starting with the centermost hole open, players move the pegs by jumping one peg over another, either in a horizontal or vertical direction and removing each peg that is jumped over. The objective for players is to remove as many pegs from the board as possible. This problem involves writing a program that will automatically play Peg-Solitaire so that we can investigate how the game might unfold based on various opening arrangements of pegs.<P>Problem Statement: There is a peg board with the following shape and with holes numbered from 1 to 33 as follows:<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"></DIV><PRE>

</PRE><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"></DIV><P><P><BR>An instance of the game begins with some holes having pegs in them and the rest of the holes being empty. The game proceeds by jumping one peg over another, either horizontally or vertically, with the peg that is jumping landing in an empty hole, and the peg being jumped over being removed from the board. For example, if 9 is empty and 10 and 11 are not, then the peg in 11 can be ``moved" to 9 with the peg in 10 being removed. After this move, 10 and 11 would both be empty but 9 would have a peg in it.<P>Given a specific board configuration your program will pick and model a specific move, over and over, until no more moves are available. Your program will then report the number of holes that still have pegs in them and their positions on the board. At any point during the game there may be more than one possible move available. In such a case always model the move with the target hole of the moving peg as large as possible. If there is more than one move available to the largest possible target hole, then choose from those moves the one with the larger source hole.<P>For example, if the board looks like this, with <TT>X</TT> representing a peg and <TT>O</TT> representing a hole:<P><P><BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"></DIV><PRE>

Baaaam! Another deadly gas bomb explodes in Manhattan's underworld. Rats have taken over the sewage and the city council is doing everything to get the rat population under control. 

<P>
As you know, Manhattan is organized in a regular fashion with streets and avenues arranged like a rectangular grid. Waste water drains run beneath the streets in the same arrangement and the rats have always set up their nests below street intersections. The only viable method to extinguish them is to use gas bombs like the one which has just exploded. However, gas bombs are not only dangerous for rats. The skyscrapers above the explosion point have to be evacuated in advance and so the point of rat attack must be chosen very carefully. The gas bombs used are built by a company called American Catastrophe Management (ACM) and they are sold under the heading of ``smart rat gas". They are smart because Ã¢Â€Â” when fired Ã¢Â€Â” the gas spreads in a rectangular fashion through the under street canals. The strength of a gas bomb is given by a number d which specifies the rectangular ``radius" of the gas diffusion area. For example, Figure shows what happens when a bomb with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I> = 1</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> explodes.

<P>A packet-switching network handles information in small units, breaking long messages into multiple packets before routing. Although each packet may travel along a different path, and the packets comprising a message may arrive at different times or out of order, the receiving computer reassembles the original message correctly.<P>The receiving computer uses a buffer memory to hold packets that arrive out of order. You must write a program that calculates the minimum buffer size in bytes needed to reassemble the incoming messages when the number of messages (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>), the number of packets (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>), the part of the messages in each packet, the size of each message, and the order of the incoming packets are given.<P>When each packet arrives, it may be placed into the buffer or moved directly to the output area. All packets that are held in the buffer are available to be moved to the output area at any time. A packet is said to ``pass the buffer" when it is moved to the output area. A message is said to ``pass the buffer" when all of its packets have passed the buffer.<P>The packets of any message must be ordered so the data in the sequence of packets that pass the buffer is in order. For example, the packet containing bytes 3 through 5 of a message must pass the buffer before the packet containing bytes 6 through 10 of the same message. Messages can pass the buffer in any order, but all packets from a single message must pass the buffer consecutively and in order (but not necessarily at the same time). Note that unlike actual buffering systems, the process for this problem can look ahead at all incoming packets to make its decisions.<P>The packets consist of data and header. The header contains three numbers: the message number, the starting byte number of data in the packet, and the ending byte number of data in the packet respectively. The first byte number in any message is 1.<P>For example, the figure below shows three messages (with sizes of 10, 20, and 5 bytes) and five packets. The minimum buffer size for this example is 10 bytes. As they arrive, packet #1 and packet #2 are stored in the buffer. They occupy 10 bytes. Then packet #3 passes the buffer directly.

<P>You have agreed to help a roofer estimate the amount of material required to protect the surface of a roof from sun damage by computing the surface area of the roof that can be seen when viewed from directly above.<P>The geometry of a roof is defined by the vertices of the triangles that enclose the plane surfaces of the roof. The <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> coordinates of a vertex are determined from an aerial view of the roof, and the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> coordinate is the height of the vertex above the ground, assuming that the ground is level (which we do). For example, a line segment with vertices (10,10,10) and (10,20,10) is parallel to the ground, and is 10 units long. A line segment with vertices (10,10,10) and (10,18,16) slopes from 10 units to 16 units above the ground; in the aerial view of the roof it is 8 units long, but the actual length is 10 units.<P>In an aerial view of a roof, one region of the roof can sometimes obscure a lower region.

<P>The Aqua Container Management company manages water storage facilities. They are considering a system of storing water in a series of connected vertical tanks. Each tank has a horizontal cross-sectional area of one square meter, but the tanks have different heights. The base of each tank is at ground level. Each tank is connected by a pipe to the previous tank in the series and by another pipe to the next tank in the series. The pipes connecting the tanks are level and are at increasing heights (that is, the pipe connecting tank <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to tank <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> + 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is at a higher level than the pipe connecting tank <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> to tank <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I> - 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.) Tank 1 is open so that air and water can flow into it freely at the top. All the other tanks are closed so that air and water can flow in and out only through the connecting pipes. The connecting pipes are large enough that water and air can flow through them freely and simultaneously but small enough that their dimensions can be ignored in this problem.<P>The series of tanks is filled by pouring water slowly into the top of tank 1, continuing until the water level reaches the top of tank 1. As the water level rises above the connecting pipes, water flows among the tanks.<P>Aqua Container Management needs a program to compute the cubic meters of water that can be poured into the series of tanks before the water level reaches the top of tank 1.<P>The figure below illustrates a simple case involving only two tanks. After the filling procedure is completed, the air in the upper part of the second tank is compressed (its air pressure is greater than one atmosphere), so the water level in the second tank is lower than the water level in the first tank.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/p3810.jpg ALT="\epsfbox{p3810.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>The following physical principles are helpful in solving this problem (some of these are approximations that are acceptable for the purposes of this problem):<P><UL><LI>Water flows downhill. </LI><LI>In an open space, the air pressure is equal to one atmosphere. </LI><LI>Air is compressible (the volume occupied by a given amount of air depends on pressure).

<P>
Curses! A handsome spy has somehow escaped from your elaborate deathtrap, overpowered your guards, and stolen your secret world domination plans. Now he is running loose in your volcano base, risking your entire evil operation. He must be stopped before he escapes! 

<P>
Fortunately, you are watching the spy's progress from your secret control room, and you have planned for just such an eventuality. Your base consists of a complicated network of rooms connected by non-intersecting tunnels. Every room has a closed-circuit camera in it (allowing you to track the spy wherever he goes), and every tunnel has a small explosive charge in it, powerful enough to permanently collapse it. The spy is too quick to be caught in a collapse, so you'll have to strategically collapse tunnels to prevent him from traveling from his initial room to the outside of your base. 

<P>
Damage to your base will be expensive to repair, so you'd like to ruin as few tunnels as possible. Find a strategy that minimizes the number of tunnels you'll need to collapse, no matter how clever the spy is. To be safe, you'll have to assume that the spy knows all about your tunnel system. Your main advantage is the fact that you can collapse tunnels whenever you like, based on your observations as the spy moves through the tunnels.

<P>
Executive of the ACM (Australian Crikey Masters) club has recently decided to switch into a new rating system in their tournaments. The new rating system is based on a combination of match result, the players' rating, the pieces that remain on the board at the end of the game, as well as a handicap for the white player's advantage for playing first (Just in case you are curious about the game of Crikey. It is a two player board game that uses black and white pieces. The list of rules is lengthy and sometimes vague. One day I shall list them.). But it is complex and requires a lot of time to calculate in a tournament with a large number of participants. A task that must be completed between matches as the result of each match changes the players' ratings. The executive wants to speed-up the process of updating the players' ratings between matches through automation and you have been asked to implement this new rating system. 

<P>
I shall now explain the updating process along with an example of a game between Alice and Bob, whose current club ratings happen to be 76.91 and 76.36 respectively in the following steps: 

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Alice, who is scheduled to play white, will be treated as though she is three (3) points stronger than her current rating. This gives Alice a rating of 79.91 against Bob's rating of 76.36, and thus a rating gap of 3.55 in favor of Alice. The rating gap is defined as the higher-rated player's rating minus the lower-rated player's rating. 
</LI>
<LI>Calculate core exchange CE as ``rating gap / 10" (rounded to 2 decimals), which is 0.355 (rounded to 0.36) in Alice vs Bob game. In case you have forgotten, the digits 5 to 9 are rounded up and the digits 1 to 4 are rounded down. 
</LI>
<LI>Calculate the rating points exchange (RPE) based on the match result as follows: 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>a.</DT>
<DD>If the player with the higher rating (in this case, Alice) wins, then the RPE is calculated as ``1 - CE". The winner's rating will go up by the RPE (in this case 0.64) and loser's rating down by the RPE.
</DD>
<DT>b.</DT>
<DD>If the player with the lower rating (in this case, Bob) wins, then the RPE is calculated as ``1 + CE". The loser's rating will go down by the RPE (in this case 1.36) and the winner's rating will go up by the RPE. 
</DD>
<DT>c.</DT>
<DD>If the game is drawn, then the RPE is calculated as ``CE". The higher-rated player's rating (in this case Alice's rating) will go down by the RPE (in this case 0.36) and the lower-rated player's rating will go up by the RPE. If both players have the same rating (after applying the handicap rule), then their ratings will not change. 
</DD>

Darts (Some historical records suggest that the first standard dartboards were the bottoms of wine casks, hence the game's original name of ``butts".) is a very popular game in which darts are thrown at a circular target (<SPAN  CLASS="textit">dart board</SPAN>) hung on a wall. Dart boards are usually made of sisal fibers or boar bristles, low quality boards are sometimes made of paper. A regulation board is 45.72 cm in diameter, and is divided into sectors. Each sector is lined with metal wire. The numbers indicating the various scores of sectors on the dart board are normally made of wire, especially on tournament-quality boards, but may be printed on the board instead. In the standard game, the dart board is hung so that the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">bulls-eye</SPAN> is 1.73 m from the floor, eye-level for a six foot person. The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">oche</SPAN>, the line behind which the player must stand, is 2.37 m from the face of the board. When playing darts players often aim at the high scoring sectors, but for ordinary players it is hard to land a dart on the desired sector. The risk of aiming at a sector can thus be measured by the difference between the scores of adjacent sectors, where two sectors are said to be adjacent if they share an edge or an arc. A large such difference increases the risk and makes the game more challenging. The total risk of a dart board is the sum over the risks between all adjacent sectors. We have been asked by the sponsor of a programming competition to design a new, and challenging, dart board to occupy the touchy coaches during the contest.

<html><head><title>Problem A: Tree Grafting</title> </head><body><h1>Problem A: Tree Grafting</h1><p><b>Input</b>: <tt>graft.in</tt><br><b>Output</b>: <tt>graft.out</tt></p>Trees have many applications in computer science. Perhaps the most commonly used trees are rooted binary trees, but there are other types of rooted trees that may be useful as well. One example is ordered trees, in which the subtrees for any given node are ordered. The number of children of each node is variable, and there is no limit on the number. Formally, an ordered tree consists of a finite set of nodes T such that<ul><li>there is one node designated as the root, denoted root(T);<br></li><li>the remaining nodes are partitioned into subsets T1, T2, ..., Tm, each of which is also a tree (subtrees).</li></ul>Also, define root(T1), ..., root(Tm) to be the children of root(T), with root(Ti) being the i-th child. The nodes root(T1), ..., root(Tm) are siblings.</p><p>It is often more convenient to represent an ordered tree as a rooted binary tree, so that each node can be stored in the same amount of memory. The conversion is performed by the following steps:</p><ol><li>remove all edges from each node to its children;</li> <li>for each node, add an edge to its first child in T (if any) as the left child;</li> <li>for each node, add an edge to its next sibling in T (if any) as the right child.</li></ol><p>This is illustrated by the following:<blockquote><pre>
         0                             0
       / | \                          /
      1  2  3       ===&gt;             1

                                       5
</pre></blockquote>In most cases, the height of the tree (the number of edges in the longest root-to-leaf path) increases after the conversion. This is undesirable because the complexity of many algorithms on trees depends on its height.</p><p>You are asked to write a program that computes the height of the tree before and after the conversion.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input is given by a number of lines giving the directions taken in a depth-first traversal of the trees. There is one line for each tree. For example, the tree above would give dudduduudu, meaning 0 down to 1, 1 up to 0, 0 down to 2, etc. The input is terminated by a line whose first character is #. You may assume that each tree has at least 2 and no more than 10000 nodes.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each tree, print the heights of the tree before and after the conversion specified above. Use the format:<blockquote><pre>
Tree t: h1 =&gt; h2
</pre></blockquote>where t is the case number (starting from 1), h1 is the height of the tree before the conversion, and h2 is the height of the tree after the conversion.</p><h2>Sample Input</h3><pre>

The prizes are determined by the number of tiles covered by the coin when it comes to rest: the more tiles it covers, the better the prize. In the following diagram, the results from five coin tosses are shown:</p><p><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/p3824.png></p><p>In this example:</p><ul><li>coin 1 covers 1 tile<br></li><li>coin 2 covers 2 tiles<br></li><li>coin 3 covers 3 tiles<br></li><li>coin 4 covers 4 tiles<br></li><li>coin 5 covers 2 tiles</li></ul><p>Notice that it is acceptable for a coin to land on the boundary of the playing area (coin 5). In order for a coin to cover a tile, the coin must cover up a positive area of the tile. In other words, it is not enough to simply touch the boundary of the tile. The center of the coin may be at any point of the playing area with uniform probability. You may assume that (1) the coin always comes to a rest lying flat, and (2) the player is good enough to guarantee that the center of the coin will always come to rest on the playing area (or the boundary).</p><p>The probability of a coin covering a certain number of tiles depends on the tile and coin sizes, as well as the number of rows and columns of tiles in the playing area. In this problem, you will be required to write a program which computes the probabilities of a coin covering a certain number of tiles.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input is an integer specifying the number of cases to follow. For each case, you will be given 4 integers m, n, t, and c on a single line, separated by spaces. The playing area consists of m rows and n columns of tiles, each having side length t. The diameter of the coin used is c. You may assume that 1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 5000, and 1 &lt;= c &lt; t &lt;= 1000.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each case, print the case number on its own line. This is followed by the probability of a coin covering 1 tile, 2 tiles, 3 tiles, and 4 tiles each on its own line. The probability should be expressed as a percentage rounded to 4 decimal places. Use the format as specified in the sample output. You should use double-precision floating-point numbers to perform the calculations.

<html><head><title>Problem E: Vacation Rentals</title> </head><body><h1>Problem E: Vacation Rentals</h1><p><b>Input</b>: <tt>vacation.in</tt><br><b>Output</b>: <tt>vacation.out</tt></p><p>The Fifth Season Resort consists of a number of condominiums which are frequently occupied by their owners. At other times, however, they are available as vacation rentals. Since the resort has no more than 26 condominiums, they are identified by upper case letters.</p><p>One day the resort manager's telephone rings. She receives a reservation request for a vacation rental with an arrival date of December 2 and a departure date of December 9. She looks at the table of reservations, but doesn't find a condominium that would be available for the entire period. Most of the existing reservations were made by the owners of the respective condominiums (who want to stay in their own units), so it is not desirable to move an existing reservation from one unit to another. As she continues to scrutinize the table of reservations, however, she has an idea and says: "I can put you up in unit B for the first three nights, and transfer you to unit F for the rest of your stay. Will that work?" The person agrees and the reservation is made. Notice that reservations are done by "nights", so that a one night reservation implies that the guest departs one day after the arrival.</p><p>The goal of this problem is to satisfy such reservation requests (without changing existing reservations), with a minimum number of transfers (from one unit to another) during the requested period.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of a number of cases. The first line of each case contains two positive integers M and N. M is the number of consecutive days for which the resort's manager has a reservation table, and N is the number of units (condominiums) in the resort. The units are labeled by upper case letters starting at 'A'. There are at most 100 days and at least 3 rooms in the reservation table. The days are numbered 1, 2, ..., M for simplicity.</p><p>The reservation table is given in the next M lines. Each line (row) of the table refers to a particular day (in the order 1, 2, 3, etc.), and each column of the table to a particular unit of the resort (in the order 'A', 'B', 'C', etc.). An entry of 'X' means that the corresponding unit is reserved for that day, while an 'O' means that the unit is available.</p><p>The reservation table is followed by one line of input, the reservation request, consisting of two integers: the arrival date and the departure date. The arrival date is in the range 1..M. The departure date is greater than the arrival date and less than or equal to M+1.</p><p>The end of input is indicated by M = N = 0.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, first print the case number followed by a colon and a blank line. If the reservation request can be met, the output will show a reservation schedule with a minimum number of transfers (from one unit to another) during the stay at the resort. Each line of the schedule corresponds to a consecutive stay in the same unit, and should be printed in the following way:<pre>
&lt;unit&gt;: &lt;start date&gt;-&lt;end date&gt;
</pre>where <tt>&lt;unit&gt;</tt> is the unit, <tt>&lt;start date&gt;</tt> is the date on which the guests moves into the unit, and <tt>&lt;end date&gt;</tt> is the date on which the guests moves out of the unit. The lines in the schedule should be ordered in ascending order by the start date.</p><p><b>Tie breaking rule.</b> There may be several schedules with a minimum number of transfers. In these cases, choose the schedule which uses the lowest "unit label" in the first day (so unit A is given preference to unit B). If there is still a tie, choose the schedule with the lowest unit number in the second day, and so on.</p><p>If the reservation request cannot be met, print the line:<pre>
Not available
</pre>instead of the schedule.</p><p>Separate the output of consecutive cases by a blank line.</p><h2>Sample Input</h2><pre>

<html><head><title>Problem F: Baseball</title> </head><body><h1>Problem F: Baseball</h1><p><b>Input</b>: <tt>baseball.in</tt><br><b>Output</b>: <tt>baseball.out</tt></p><p>Baseball is a game full of statistics. But what good are these statistics? Maybe they can be used to predict the outcome of a game.</p><p>A baseball game consists of 9 innings. If the game is tied after 9 innings, one additional inning is played at a time until the game is no longer tied at the end of the additional inning. Each inning is divided into two halves, in which one team "attacks" and the other team "defends". The visiting team attacks in the first half, while the home team attacks in the second half. If the home team is leading at the start of the second half of the 9th inning, the game ends because the winner has already been determined.</p><p>Each team submits a "batting order" at the beginning of the game indicating the order in which its 9 players will bat during the attack half of the inning. In each half of an inning, the players in the attacking team bat according to the batting order. The first batter in the first inning is the first one in the batting order. Each subsequent batter is the next batter in the batting order. If the previous batter is the last player in the batting order, the next batter is the first player in the batting order again. In each subsequent inning, the first player to bat is the player following the last player who has batted in the batting order.</p><p>When a player is successful at bat (a hit), the player at bat advances to the first base, and any other players already on base advance by one base (in real games a player may advance by multiple bases, but we will not consider this case in this problem). A player must advance to first base, second base, third base, and finally the home base in order to score a run. When a player reaches the home base, he is returned to the bench to wait for his next opportunity to bat. The half of an inning continues indefinitely until 3 attacking players are unsuccessful at bat (each unsuccessful batter is an "out"). When this happens, any players left on first, second, or third base return to the bench and do not score. The team that scores the most runs at the end of the game wins.</p><p>In certain situations, a player may "sacrifice" himself in order to advance the players already on base. If a sacrifice is successful, the player at bat is out but each player already on base is advanced by one base. A player advancing to the home base this way scores a run, unless the sacrificed batter is the third out of the inning. In the latter case, the half of the inning is over and no run is scored. If a sacrifice is unsuccessful, the batter is out and none of the players advances. A batter will attempt to sacrifice whenever there is a player on second base with zero out, or when there is a player on third base with at most one out.</p><p>One of the most commonly cited statistics for players is the "hit percentage" (between 0 and 1) for each player, indicating the proportion of time the player is successful at bat. Similarly, the "sacrifice percentage" of a player is the proportion of time the player is successful at a sacrifice. In this problem, you will be given the hit percentage and the sacrifice percentage of each of the 9 players in a team as well as a batting order. You will be asked to simulate a baseball game. Random numbers are required in a simulation, and you will use the following random number generator:<pre>
x(n+1) = (x(n) * 25173 + 13849) % 65536
</pre>where <code>x(n)</code> is the previous random number and <code>x(n+1)</code> is the next random number. The calculations above should be performed using 32-bit integers. You should start with the "seed" <code>x(0) = 1</code>; the first random number generated by your program is <code>x(1)</code>. Each time the simulation needs to determine if a hit or a sacrifice is successful, it should generate the next random number. A hit (or a sacrifice) is successful if<pre>
random_number / 65536 &lt;= hit (or sacrifice) percentage
</pre>The division in this formula is floating-point division. Do not reset the random number generator (i.e. resetting the seed to 1) except at the beginning of each game.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of a number of games. The first line of the input file specifies the number of games to follow. Each game contains the batting order of the visiting team followed by the batting order of the home team. The batting order of each team starts with a line specifying the team name (at most 15 upper and lower case letters). The next 9 lines specify the 9 players, listed in the order they bat. Each of these lines contains the player's name (at most 15 upper and lower case characters), a space, then a floating-point number (to 3 decimal places) specifying his hit percentage, a space, and finally his sacrifice percentage (to 3 decimal places). You may assume that all hit percentages are between .200 and .400, and all sacrifice percentages are between .300 and .750. You may assume that no game will last more than 200 innings.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each game, print the game number as well as the visiting and home team names in the first line, as follows:<pre>
Game &lt;x&gt;: &lt;visiting&gt; vs. &lt;home&gt;
</pre>This is followed by a blank line.</p><p>Next print the players who score hits and runs, separately, for each inning in the order they occur in the game. Use the format as follows:<pre>
Inning 1:
Hits:
  &lt;player1&gt; &lt;team&gt;
  &lt;player2&gt; &lt;team&gt;

Runs:
  &lt;player3&gt; &lt;team&gt;
  &lt;player4&gt; &lt;team&gt;

</pre>Indent the list of players by two spaces. Print the player name and the team name right-justified in a field width of 15 (in addition to the indentation before the player's name and one space separation between the player's name and team name). If no one scores a hit or a run, print the single line<pre>
  none
</pre>(indented by two spaces) in the appropriate section instead of a list of players. Print a blank line after the output for each inning.</p><p>At the end of the game, print a summary on the number of runs and hits scored for each team, starting with the visiting team:<pre>
End of Game:
  &lt;visiting&gt; &lt;x&gt; runs, &lt;x&gt; hits
  &lt;home&gt; &lt;x&gt; runs, &lt;x&gt; hits
</pre>The summary should be indented by two spaces. Print the team name right-justified in a field width of 15 (in addition to the indentation).</p><p>Separate the output of consecutive games by a line containing 60 '=' signs.</p><h2>Sample Input</h2><pre>

<html><head><title>Problem G: Team Work</title> </head><body><h1>Problem G: Team Work</h1><p><b>Input</b>: <tt>teamwork.in</tt><br><b>Output</b>: <tt>teamwork.out</tt></p><p>A certain programming contest coach is frustrated with the lack of team work in his teams. He decided to demonstrate to his students the importance of team work by using the following well-known analogy: it is very easy to take a single piece of stick and snap it into two halves. But if you bundle three sticks together (i.e. the three members of the team) you now have to apply a lot more force to snap the sticks. The coach is certain that his teams will understand the importance of team work after this demonstration.</p><p>So the coach went out to the forest to collect the sticks. The coach knows that a demonstration should always be rehearsed to debug any problems. He ensures that it is practically impossible to snap three sticks bundled together and that it is very easy to snap individual sticks. Oh no! Every stick he has carefully collected snapped into smaller pieces. He can go out to collect more sticks, but how would he know that the sticks would work with the demonstration?</p><p>The coach came up with a clever idea: just glue the pieces back together to form larger sticks! It appears that every piece can be glued together securely with any other piece even if the two pieces came from different sticks originally. Thus, he can reconstruct sticks by putting two or more pieces together. The reconstructed sticks have the added advantage that each individual stick is really easy to snap at the connection point. However, if two sticks have a connection point at the same location, the two sticks will snap just as easily when bundled together. Therefore, he must reconstruct three sticks in such a way that none of the connection points coincide. Furthermore, it is desirable for the reconstructed sticks to be as long as possible. Finally, the three reconstructed sticks must have the same length---the coach does not want to imply that one team member is better than another. It is acceptable to leave some pieces unused. Each piece can only be used once, of course.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of a number of cases. Each case is specified on one line. The first number specifies the number of pieces (N). Each of the following N numbers is a positive integer specifying the length of each piece. There are at most 13 pieces, and the length of each piece is at most 25. The end of input is specified by a case in which N = 0.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each case, print the case number followed by a colon, followed by the longest possible length of the three reconstructed sticks on a single line. If it is impossible to reconstruct three sticks satisfying the constraints stated, then 0 is the longest possible length of the reconstructed sticks.</p><h2>Sample Input</h2><pre>

<html><head><title>Problem H: Wavelet Compression</title> </head><body><h1>Problem H: Wavelet Compression</h1><p><b>Input</b>: <tt>wavelet.in</tt><br><b>Output</b>: <tt>wavelet.out</tt></p><p>The discrete wavelet transform is a popular tool for signal compression. In this problem, your job is to write a program to decompress a one-dimensional signal (a list of integers) that has been compressed by a simple wavelet transform.</p><p>To understand how this simple wavelet transform works, suppose that we have a list of an even number of integers. We compute the sum and difference of each pair of consecutive samples, resulting in two lists of sums and differences each having half the original length. Formally, if the original samples are<pre>
a(1),..., a(n)
</pre>the i-th sum <code>s(i)</code> and difference <code>d(i)</code> are computed as:<pre>
for i = 1,...,n/2:
  s(i) = a(2*i-1) + a(2*i)
  d(i) = a(2*i-1) - a(2*i)
</pre>This is then rearranged to give the transformed signal by first listing the sums and then the differences. For example, if the input signal is:<pre>
  5, 2, 3, 2, 5, 7, 9, 6
</pre>Then the sum and difference signals are:<pre>
   s(i) = 7, 5, 12, 15
   d(i) = 3, 1, -2, 3
</pre>Thus, the transformed signal is:<pre>
  7, 5, 12, 15, 3, 1, -2, 3
</pre></p><p>The same process is applied recursively to the first half of the transformed signal, treating <code>s(i)</code> as the input signal, until the length of the input signal is 1. In the example above, the final transformed signal is:<pre>
   39, -15, 2, -3, 3, 1, -2, 3
</pre>It is assumed that the length of the original input is a power of 2, and the input signal consists of integers between 0 and 255 (inclusive) only.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of a number of cases. Each case is specified on a line, starting with an integer <code>N</code> (1 &lt;= <code>N</code> &lt;= 256) indicating the number of samples. The next <code>N</code> integers are the transformed samples. The end of input is indicated by a case in which <code>N</code> = 0.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, output the original samples on a single line, separated by a single space.</p><h2>Sample Input</h2><pre>

Sadly, it is not uncommon to see university students who cannot do simple arithmetic without electronic aids. Professor Peano has had enough. He has decided to take the matter into his own hands and force his students to become proficient in the most basic arithmetic skill: addition of non-negative integers. Since the students do not have a good foundation in this skill, he decided to go back to the basics and represent non-negative integers with set theory.</p><p>The non-negative integers are represented by the following sets:</p><p></p><ul><li>0 is represented by the empty set {}.<br></li><li>For any number n &gt; 0, n is represented by a set containing the representations of all non-negative integers smaller than n.</li></ul><p>For example, the first 4 non-negative integers are represented by:<br></p><pre><br>  0 =&gt; {}<br>  1 =&gt; {{}}<br>  2 =&gt; {{},{{}}}<br>  3 =&gt; {{},{{}},{{},{{}}}}<br></pre><br>and so on. Notice that the cardinality (size) of the set is exactly the integer it represents. Although the elements of a set are generally unordered, Professor Peano requires that the elements of a set be ordered in increasing cardinality to make the assignments easier to grade. As an added advantage, Professor Peano is sure that there are no calculators or computer programs that can deal with numbers written in this notation.<p>Not surprisingly, many students cannot cope with this basic task and will fail the course if they do not get help soon.

<P>Alpha-Triangle is the unique equilateral triangle that is formed by joining each and every word contained in a given set of words. Like all triangles, an Alpha-Triangle has three vertices and three sides. A point with no dimension represents a vertex in the triangle.<P>A side in an Alpha-Triangle has an identity, a length and a direction. It begins with a vertex, continues with a string of letters and ends up with another vertex. The string of letters identifies the side as well as defines the direction from the beginning to the end of the string. It is made up of a sequence of one or more words belonging to the given set. A word, say <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, in the sequence is linked to the word appearing next, say <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>; the last letter of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the first letter of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>; however the common letter appears in the string only once. The total number of letters in the string defines the length of the side. Like all equilateral triangles three sides of an Alpha-Triangle are of equal length.

Since there are only four suits, the five cards selected by the viewer contain at least two cards of the same suit. The assistant gives one card of the same suit to the viewer, call it the hidden card and one another card of the same suit to the magician, and call it the base card. The base card indicates the suit of the hidden card so that the magician is required to know only the rank of the hidden card. Since the rank of the base card is known, the unknown rank of the hidden card can have one of the 12 ranks not known yet. The assistant plays a trick. She selects the hidden card and the base card so that the rank of the hidden card can be obtained by adding at most 6 to the rank of the base card. If the sum after addition turns out to be greater than 13 then the sum (mod 13) is considered to be the rank, otherwise the sum itself is considered as the rank. Since cards are totally ordered the three remaining cards can be identified by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>: Lowest, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>: Medium and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>: Highest ranked cards.

<P>Barracks in a garrison are structured in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> rows and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> columns with certain security arrangements at each row-column position. Most of the positions are well guarded; however certain positions remain weakly guarded. All positions on the boundary, either well guarded or weakly guarded, are considered vulnerable. With respect to a given vulnerable weakly guarded position, positions appearing next to it column-wise/ row-wise/ diagonally, are considered vulnerable. Thus for a given vulnerable weakly guarded position there are at most eight vulnerable positions. Positions, which are neither vulnerable nor weakly guarded, are considered strongly secured. You are required to write a program to find all strongly secured positions in the garrison.<P>Let a zero `<TT>0</TT>' identify a weakly guarded position and a one `<TT>1</TT>' identify a wellguarded position.

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"><html><head><meta name="generator" content="HTML Tidy for Windows (vers 12 April 2005), see www.w3.org"><title>Typesetting</title> <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=us-ascii"><meta name="Author" content="Ron Pacheco"></head><body style="background-color: white;" lang="EN-US"><p>Modern fonts are generally of two varieties: outline fonts, whose glyphs (the individual character shapes) are specified mathematically as a set of curves, and bitmap fonts, whose glyphs are specified as patterns of pixels. Fonts may also include embedded information such as kerning pairs (adjusting the spacing between certain pairs of glyphs, such as "AW", so that they appear spaced correctly), tracking hints (for managing inter-glyph spacing), antialiasing hints (smoothing of pixellated edges), and much more. To be sure, modern fonts are more than a simple collection of shapes, and displaying them properly is a common programming challenge.</p><p>For this problem we will concern ourselves with bitmapped fonts and a simple form of typesetting called glyph packing. Essentially, the idea is to pack the glyphs as tightly as possible while maintaining at least one horizontal pixel of separation between glyphs. For example, consider the glyphs shown to the left below for the Roman characters "P" and "J". The figure to the right shows them after glyph packing. Note that they are as close as possible without touching horizontally.</p><p><img alt="PJ" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/p3846a.png></p>Here's another example. In this case, notice that the final glyph cannot be packed at all.<p><img alt="Fiji" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/p3846a.png></p>After packing, pixels from distinct glyphs may be adjacent diagonally or vertically, but not horizontally. The following example shows that pixels may be adjacent diagonally. The "Love" test case in the example input section shows that they may be adjacent vertically.<p><img alt="two slashes" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/p3846a.png></p>Glyph packing has the nice property that it's easy to build "fancy" glyphs into the font so that glyph packing creates special effects with no extra work. Look at the "Toy" example below. The same simple packing process has been applied to these glyphs as to the ones above, but the result is more dramatic:<p><img alt="Toy" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/p3846a.png></p>Glyph packing has a few caveats, however, one of which we must concern ourselves with for this problem. Consider the example on the left below where a glyph for a hyphen is followed by a glyph for an underscore. Based on our one horizontal pixel of separation rule, how would this pack? Clearly something more is needed, and that something more is hinting within the glyphs themselves. Recall that in actual practice, fonts contain kerning pairs, tracking hints, etc. For our purposes, our hinting will be limited to "invisible" pixels that count as a pixel for the purpose of packing, but not for display. The center image below represents invisible pixels as open dots instead of closed dots. Now the two glyphs can be properly packed, resulting in the output shown on the right.<p><img alt="hidden pixels" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/p3846a.png></p><p>Now for the formal definition of a proper packing: (1) Glyphs are packed as close as possible without allowing any pixels from different glyphs to be immediately horizontally adjacent; (2) Given two glyphs, they may not be packed in such a way that any pixel of the leftmost glyph at a given height ends up positioned to the right of any pixel at the same height in the rightmost glyph.</p><p>Condition (2) above is easily understood by visualizing two glyphs sitting side by side, separated by a small space. If you "squeeze" them together, condition (2) says that their pixels are not allowed to "pass through" one another. Consider the example to the left below. The center image is not the proper packing, because it violates condition (2) of the formal definition. The image on the right is the proper packing of these glyphs.</p><p><img alt="hooks" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/p3846a.png></p><p><b>Input:</b> The input for this problem is sets of glyphs to be packed. In a given test case, all glyphs are the same height, and an integer, N, on the first line of the test case specifies this height. The next N lines contain the glyphs to be packed. Empty pixels in a glyph are represented by a dot '.' character. Non-empty pixels are represented by a hash mark '#' for visible pixels, and a zero '0' for invisible pixels. Glyphs are separated by a single column of space characters. The input will always consist of more than one glyph, at least one of which will always contain at least one visible pixel. A glyph will always have at least one non-empty pixel in its leftmost and rightmost column, and every glyph will have at least one non-empty pixel at the same height as at least one other glyph in the input. The minimum dimension of a glyph is 1 x 1, the maximum dimension is 20 x 20, and the maximum number of glyphs that will appear in any test case is 20. Test cases continue until a value of zero is specified for N.</p><p><b>Output:</b> For each test case, first output the number of that test case (starting with 1) on a line by itself. Then output the proper packing of the input glyphs, using the dot '.' character for empty pixels and for invisible pixels, and the hash mark '#' character for visible pixels. Omit leading and trailing empty columns (columns with no visible pixels) so that both the leftmost and rightmost output columns contain at least one visible pixel.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="10"><thead><tr><td><b>Example Input:</b></td><td><b>Example Output:</b></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="font-family: monospace; letter-spacing: 2px;">8<br>###. ...#<br>#..# ...#<br>#..# ...#<br>###. ...#<br>#... ...#<br>#... ...#<br>#... #..#<br>#... ####<br>8<br>############# .... .............<br>..#.......... .... .............<br>..#.......... .##. .........#..#<br>..#.......... #..# .........#..#<br>..#.......... #..# .........#..#<br>..#.......... .##. ..........###<br>............. .... ............#<br>............. .... ############.<br>8<br>############# .............<br>..#.......... .............<br>..#.......... .........#..#<br>..#.......... .........#..#<br>..#.......... .........#..#<br>..#.......... ..........###<br>............. ............#<br>............. ############.<br>5<br>0..0 0..0<br>0..0 0..0<br>#### 0..0<br>0..0 0..0<br>0..0 ####<br>5<br>#.... .###.<br>#.... #...#<br>#...# #...#<br>#...# ....#<br>.###. ....#<br>3<br>### 0.0 ###<br>#.# 0.0 #.#<br>### 0.0 ###<br>3<br>0.0 ### 0.0<br>0.0 #.# 0.0<br>0.0 ### 0.0<br>8<br>#.... .... ..... ....<br>#.... .... ..... ....<br>#.... .##. #...# .##.<br>#.... #..# .#.#. #..#<br>#.... #..# .#.#. #..#<br>#.... #..# .#.#. ###.<br>#.... .##. ..#.. #...<br>##### .... ..#.. .###<br>0<br></td><td style="font-family: monospace; letter-spacing: 2px;" valign="top">1<br>###..#<br>#..#.#<br>#..#.#<br>###..#<br>#....#<br>#....#<br>#.#..#<br>#.####<br>2<br>#############<br>..#..........<br>..#..##..#..#<br>..#.#..#.#..#<br>..#.#..#.#..#<br>..#..##...###<br>............#<br>############.<br>3<br>.....#############<br>.......#..........<br>.......#.#..#.....<br>.......#.#..#.....<br>.......#.#..#.....<br>.......#..###.....<br>............#.....<br>############......<br>4<br>.........<br>.........<br>####.....<br>.........<br>.....####<br>5<br>#......###.<br>#.....#...#<br>#...#.#...#<br>#...#.....#<br>.###......#<br>6<br>###.....###<br>#.#.....#.#<br>###.....###<br>7<br>###<br>#.#<br>###<br>8<br>#..............<br>#..............<br>#..##.#...#.##.<br>#.#..#.#.#.#..#<br>#.#..#.#.#.#..#<br>#.#..#.#.#.###.<br>#..##...#..#...<br>#####...#...###<br></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

Slitherlink puzzles are gaining momentum, and books of Slitherlink puzzles have started showing up around the world. The puzzles are simple to understand, but can be challenging to solve. The puzzle is simply a rectangular grid of dots that forms a collection of cells, every cell being either blank or containing an integer from zero to three. The challenge is to connect the dots with line segments to form a cycle (a connected path such that every vertex has precisely two incident edges), in such a way that every cell with a value has exactly the number of incident edges as the digit it contains. Cells with no value may have any number of incident edges. A valid Slitherlink puzzle always contains sufficient non-empty cells to guarantee a unique solution. Below is an example from the Nikoli web site of a Slitherlink puzzle and its solution.</p><p><img alt="slitherlink example" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/p3848a.png></p><p>It was shown by Takayuki Yato at the University of Tokyo that the general Slitherlink problem is NP-complete. (If you are not familiar with this concept, informally it means there is no "efficient" algorithm to solve the problem.) With a slight modification and some simple heuristics, however, programmatic solutions are possible. Our new puzzle, which we will term Slink, differs from Slitherlink only in that the puzzle may not have empty cells. That is, every cell must specify the number of incident edges. Below is the Slitherlink puzzle above converted to Slink (the added numbers are shown in gray). Note that the solution does not change, only the information given in the puzzle itself.</p><p><img alt="slink example" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/p3848a.png></p><p>The heuristics for solving Slink arise from the nature of the puzzle itself. For example, consider a cell containing a zero. There must be no incident edges, therefore all edges incident to all zeros can be immediately removed from consideration as part of the solution path. Consider a three next to a zero. Because all the edges incident to the zero will be eliminated, the common edge shared with the three is also eliminated. But that leaves only three edges around the three, and therefore those three edges must be part of the solution path. The following table specifies the heuristic rules that must be properly applied to solve a Slink puzzle. The "x" characters between vertices mark edges that are not part of the solution path, while line segments between vertices mark edges that form part of the solution. Grey elements are the pattern the rule is based on, black elements indicate the additional edges that should be included or excluded if the rule is matched. Note that the pictured examples are for demonstration purposes only and do <i>not</i> illustrate every possible arrangement of the stated rule!</p><table border="1" cellpadding="3"><tr><th>Examples</th><th>Rule Specification</th><td bgcolor="#CCCCCC">Â </td><th>Examples</th><th>Rule Specification</th></tr><tr><td><img alt="case 1" src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/p3848a.png></td><td>The easiest and most obvious of all the rules.

In general a sequence is specified by integers A, B, C, and S, where 1 &#8804; A &lt; 32768, 0 &#8804; B &lt; 65536, 2 &#8804; C &lt; 65536, and 0 &#8804; S &lt; C. S is the first element (the <dfn>seed</dfn>) of the sequence, and each later element is generated from the previous element. If X is an element of the sequence, then the next element is</p><blockquote>(A*X + B) % C</blockquote><p>where '%' is the remainder or modulus operation. Although every element of the sequence will be a 16-bit unsigned integer less than 65536, the intermediate result A*X + B may be larger, so calculations should be done with a 32-bit <i>int</i> rather than a 16-bit <i>short</i> to ensure accurate results.</p><p>Some values of the parameters produce better sequences than others. The most embarrassing sequences to WhatNext Software are ones that never change one or more bits. A bit that never changes throughout the sequence is <dfn>persistent</dfn>. Ideally, a sequence will have no persistent bits. Your job is to test a sequence and determine which bits are persistent.</p><p>For example, a particularly bad choice is A = 2, B = 5, C = 18, and S = 3. It produces the sequence 3, (2*3+5)%18 = 11, (2*11+5)%18 = 9, (2*9+5)%18 = 5, (2*5+5)%18 = 15, (2*15+5)%18 = 17, then (2*17+5)%18 = 3 again, and we're back at the beginning. So the sequence repeats the the same six values over and over:</p><table style="text-align: left; width: 200px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td style="font-family: monospace;" align="center" valign="middle">Decimal</td><td style="font-family: monospace;" align="center" valign="middle">16-Bit Binary</td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: monospace;" align="center" valign="middle">3</td><td style="font-family: monospace;" align="center" valign="middle">0000000000000011</td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: monospace;" align="center" valign="middle">11</td><td style="font-family: monospace;" align="center" valign="middle">0000000000001011</td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: monospace;" align="center" valign="middle">9</td><td style="font-family: monospace;" align="center" valign="middle">0000000000001001</td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: monospace;" align="center" valign="middle">5</td><td style="font-family: monospace;" align="center" valign="middle">0000000000000101</td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: monospace;" align="center" valign="middle">15</td><td style="font-family: monospace;" align="center" valign="middle">0000000000001111</td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: monospace;" align="center" valign="middle">17</td><td style="font-family: monospace;" align="center" valign="middle">0000000000010001</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle">overall</td><td style="font-family: monospace;" align="center" valign="middle">00000000000????1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The last line of the table indicates which bit positions are always 0, always 1, or take on both values in the sequence. Note that 12 of the 16 bits are persistent. (Good random sequences will have no persistent bits, but the converse is not necessarily true. For example, the sequence defined by A = 1, B = 1, C = 64000, and S = 0 has no persistent bits, but it's also not random: it just counts from 0 to 63999 before repeating.)

Given their violent, fun-loving nature, keeping their leaders alive is of serious concern. Part of the Gorelian security plan involves changing the traffic patterns of their cities on a daily basis, and routing all Gorelian Government Officials to the Government Building by the fastest possible route.</p><p>Fortunately for the Gorelian Minister of Traffic (that would be you), all Gorelian cities are laid out as a rectangular grid of blocks, where each block is a square measuring 2520 rels per side (a rel is the Gorelian Official Unit of Distance). The speed limit between two adjacent intersections is always constant, and may range from 1 to 9 rels per blip (a blip, of course, being the Gorelian Official Unit of Time). Since Gorelians have outlawed decimal numbers as unholy (hey, if you're the dominant force in the known universe, you can outlaw whatever you want), speed limits are always integer values. This explains why Gorelian blocks are precisely 2520 rels in length: 2520 is the least common multiple of the integers 1 through 9. Thus, the time required to travel between two adjacent intersections is always an integer number of blips.</p><p>In all Gorelian cities, Government Housing is always at the northwest corner of the city, while the Government Building is always at the southeast corner. Streets between intersections might be one-way or two-way, or possibly even closed for repair (all this tinkering with traffic patterns causes a lot of accidents). Your job, given the details of speed limits, street directions, and street closures for a Gorelian city, is to determine the fastest route from Government Housing to the Government Building. (It is possible, due to street directions and closures, that no route exists, in which case a Gorelian Official Temporary Holiday is declared, and the Gorelian Officials take the day off.)</p><div align="center"><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/p3850.png alt="Gorelian city"></div><p>The picture above shows a Gorelian City marked with speed limits, one way streets, and one closed street. It is assumed that streets are always traveled at the exact posted speed limit, and that turning a corner takes zero time. Under these conditions, you should be able to determine that the fastest route from Government Housing to the Government Building in this city is 1715 blips. And if the next day, the only change is that the closed road is opened to two way traffic at 9 rels per blip, the fastest route becomes 1295 blips. On the other hand, suppose the three one-way streets are switched from southbound to northbound (with the closed road remaining closed). In that case, no route would be possible and the day would be declared a holiday.</p><p><b>Input:</b> The input consists of a set of cities for which you must find a fastest route if one exists. The first line of an input case contains two integers, which are the vertical and horizontal number of city blocks, respectively. The smallest city is a single block, or 1 by 1, and the largest city is 20 by 20 blocks. The remainder of the input specifies speed limits and traffic directions for streets between intersections, one row of street segments at a time. The first line of the input (after the dimensions line) contains the data for the northernmost east-west street segments. The next line contains the data for the northernmost row of north-south street segments. Then the next row of east-west streets, then north-south streets, and so on, until the southernmost row of east-west streets. Speed limits and directions of travel are specified in order from west to east, and each consists of an integer from 0 to 9 indicating speed limit, and a symbol indicating which direction traffic may flow. A zero speed limit means the road is closed. All digits and symbols are delimited by a single space. For east-west streets, the symbol will be an asterisk '*' which indicates travel is allowed in both directions, a less-than symbol '&lt;' which indicates travel is allowed only in an east-to-west direction, or a greater-than symbol '&gt;' which indicates travel is allowed only in a west-to-east direction. For north-south streets, an asterisk again indicates travel is allowed in either direction, a lowercase "vee" character 'v' indicates travel is allowed only in a north-to-south directions, and a caret symbol '^' indicates travel is allowed only in a south-to-north direction. A zero speed, indicating a closed road, is always followed by an asterisk. Input cities continue in this manner until a value of zero is specified for both the vertical and horizontal dimensions.</p><p><b>Output:</b> For each input scenario, output a line specifying the integer number of blips of the shortest route, a space, and then the word "blips". For scenarios which have no route, output a line with the word "Holiday".</p><table border="1" cellpadding="10"><thead><tr><td><b>Example Input:</b></td><td><b>Example Output:</b></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="font-family: monospace;">2 2<br>9 * 9 *<br>6 v 0 * 8 v<br>3 * 7 *<br>3 * 6 v 3 *<br>4 * 8 *<br>2 2<br>9 * 9 *<br>6 v 9 * 8 v<br>3 * 7 *<br>3 * 6 v 3 *<br>4 * 8 *<br>2 2<br>9 * 9 *<br>6 ^ 0 * 8 ^<br>3 * 7 *<br>3 * 6 ^ 3 *<br>4 * 8 *<br>0 0<br></td><td style="font-family: monospace;" valign="top">1715 blips<br>1295 blips<br>Holiday<br></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

Document security is handled via <dfn>access control lists</dfn> (ACLs). An ACL defines a set of entities that have access to the document, and for each entity defines the set of rights that it has. Entities are denoted by uppercase letters; an entity might be a single individual or an entire division. Rights are denoted by lowercase letters; examples of rights are <i>a</i> for <i>append</i>, <i>d</i> for <i>delete</i>, <i>e</i> for <i>edit</i>, and <i>r</i> for <i>read</i>.</p><p>The ACL for a document is stored along with that document, but there is also a separate ACL <dfn>log</dfn> stored on a separate log server. All documents start with an empty ACL, which grants no rights to anyone. Every time the ACL for a document is changed, a new entry is written to the log. An entry is of the form <i>ExR</i>, where <i>E</i> is a nonempty set of entities, <i>R</i> is a nonempty set of rights, and <i>x</i> is either "+", "&#8211;", or "=". Entry <i>E</i>+<i>R</i> says to grant all the rights in <i>R</i> to all the entities in <i>E</i>, entry <i>E</i>&#8211;<i>R</i> says to remove all the rights in <i>R</i> from all the entities in <i>E</i>, and entry <i>E</i>=<i>R</i> says that all the entities in <i>E</i> have exactly the rights in <i>R</i> and no others. An entry might be redundant in the sense that it grants an entity a right it already has and/or denies an entity a right that it doesn't have. A log is simply a list of entries separated by commas, ordered chronologically from oldest to most recent. Entries are cumulative, with newer entries taking precedence over older entries if there is a conflict.</p><p>Periodically the Tyrell corporation will run a security check by using the logs to compute the current ACL for each document and then comparing it with the ACL actually stored with the document. A mismatch indicates a security breach. Your job is to write a program that, given an ACL log, computes the current ACL.</p><p><b>Input:</b> The input consists of one or more ACL logs, each 3&#8211;79 characters long and on a line by itself, followed by a line containing only "#" that signals the end of the input.

Bluewater has found that clients are interested in having guards posted where they can see everything that is valuable merely by turning their heads, and also like guards to be posted particularly close to particularly valuable items. A sample site layout is shown above. Ignore the three black dots for now. Various locations are labeled and assigned values. For instance location A at coordinates (0,8) is the position of an item with value 4. Locations showing a value 0, like G, do not have a valuable item. The straight lines indicate corridors. For simplicity, corridors are modeled as line segments withÂ 0 width. A guard at an intersection point of several corridors can see and therefore guard the items on each of the corridors. If Bluewater wereÂ contracted to supply 3 guards, they mightÂ choose to post them at the positions indicated with the small black dots. The guard not at an already labeled position is at (15.5, 6). To model the desire for guards to be closer to items of higher value, Bluewater calculates the <span style="font-style: italic;">risk</span> to a valuable item to be the value of the item times the minimum distance to a guard that can <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> the item. Even if a guard is close to an item that is around a corner, that guard does <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> affect the risk to the item, since the guard cannot see around a corner. In the diagram shown, the risks to the items are A:Â 4x5=20, C:Â 4x2.5=10, D:Â 2x0=0, .... The largest risks are forÂ H:Â 50x7.5=375 and I:Â 50x7.5=375, so the maximumÂ risk to any one item is 375. With this site layout, no arrangement of 3 guards would provide a lower maximum risk, so this arrangement of 3 guards minimizes the maximum risk. Bluewater would like to be able to tell any client who requests a particular number of guards for a particular site layout, what the minimized maximum risk will be.</p><p><b>Input:</b> TheÂ input will consistÂ of one to sixteen data sets,Â followed by a line containing only 0. On each line the data will consist of blank separated tokens.</p><p>The first line of a dataset containsÂ integers <span style="font-style: italic;">p c g</span>, where <span style="font-style: italic;">p</span> is the number of points specified, <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span> is the number of corridors, and <span style="font-style: italic;">g</span> is the number of guards to be placed. Constraints are 1<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt; p</span> &lt; 12; 0 &lt; <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span> &lt; 12; 0 &lt; <span style="font-style: italic;">g</span> &lt; 5. Â </p><p>Next in the dataset are a total of <span style="font-style: italic;">p</span> groups of four tokens, each consisting of a capital letter and three nonnegativeÂ integers <span style="font-style: italic;">L</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">x y v</span> indicating the point (<span style="font-style: italic;">x</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">y</span>) with label <span style="font-style: italic;">L</span> contains an item with value <span style="font-style: italic;">v</span>. If <span style="font-style: italic;">p</span> is no greaterÂ than 6, these groups will all be on one line. If <span style="font-style: italic;">p</span> is greater than 6, then the seventh and further groups will be on the next line. Labels will be consecutive letters starting from A. All the numbersÂ are less than 1000. Each of the points is unique. A value of 0 forÂ <span style="font-style: italic;">v</span> means there is no item of value there. The number of locations with items of value will be at least as large as the number of guards.Â </p><p>The lastÂ line of a dataset contains <span style="font-style: italic;">cÂ </span>strings of letters, one for each corridor. For each corridor theÂ letters are labels for points along the corridor, in order along the line segment from one end to the other, including both endpoints, all intersection points with other corridors,Â and all locations on the corridor with a valuable item. Each of the points given in the dataset will lie on at least one of the corridors. Â </p><p><b>Output:</b> There is one line of output for each data set.

The goal is to throw a rock so that it skips as many times as possible; the exact rules for determining the winner are given below. To make the competitions interesting, the IRSL often chooses lakes with logs, sandbars, and other obstacles. You are provided with a side-view, water-level "map" of the lake as shown in the top line of the example below. (The numbers 0..29 below the map are just for reference.) A period (".") indicates clear water, where a rock will skip; any other character indicates some kind of obstacle that will stop a rock.</p><blockquote><tt>...=...**..#...@....:.:.:..=..</tt><br><tt>______________________________</tt><br><tt>Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  11111111112222222222</tt><br><tt>012345678901234567890123456789</tt></blockquote><p>You stand at the left end of the lake. You can throw a rock so that it lands at any position in the lake, and then skips at any fixed interval thereafter. So a throw can be defined as a pair (<i>i</i>,<i>d</i>), where <i>i</i> &ge; 0 is the initial landing position and <i>d</i> &gt; 0 is the distance between skips. Note that <i>d</i> must be positive. The <dfn>count</dfn> of a throw is the number of times that it skips on the water. The <dfn>length</dfn> is the position of its last contact with either the water or an obstacle. To rank two distinct throws, use the following criteria, in order, until a winner is determined: count (highest wins); length (greatest wins); initial position (greatest wins); distance between skips (smallest wins).</p><p>For the map shown above, throw (27,2) hits the obstacle at position 27; it has count 0 and length 27. Throw (16,1) skips at positions 16, 17, 18, and 19, then hits the obstacle at position 20; it has count 4 and length 20, so it beats throw (27,2). Throw (2,7) skips at positions 2, 9, 16, and 23, then skips over the lake; it has count 4 and length 23, so it beats throw (16,1).

The list below shows which letters they used and what numeric value each of those letters represents:</p><p></p><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td align="right">I</td><td></td><td>=</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td align="right">V</td><td></td><td>=</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td align="right">X</td><td></td><td>=</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td align="right">L</td><td></td><td>=</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td align="right">C</td><td></td><td>=</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td align="right">D</td><td></td><td>=</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td align="right">M</td><td></td><td>=</td><td>1000</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Using these seven numerals, any desired number can be formed by following the two basic <i>additive</i> and <i>subtractive</i> rules. To form a number using the additive rule the Roman numerals are simply written from left to right in descending order, and the value of each roman numeral is added together. For example, the number MMCLVII has the value 1000 + 1000 + 100 + 50 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 2157. Using the addition rule alone could lead to very long strings of letters, so the subtraction rule was invented as a result. Using this rule, a smaller Roman numeral to the left of a larger one is subtracted from the total. In other words, the number MCMXIV is interpreted as 1000 Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ 100 + 1000 + 10 Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ 1 + 5 = 1914.</p><p>Over time the Roman number writing system became more standardized and several additional rules were developed. The additional rules used today are:</p><p></p><ol><li>The I, X, or C Roman numerals may only be repeated up to three times in succession. In other words, the number 4 must be represented as IV and <i>not</i> as IIII. </li><li>The V, L, or D numerals may never be repeated in succession, and the M numeral may be repeated as many times as necessary. </li><li>Only one smaller numeral can be placed to the left of another. For example, the number 18 is represented as XVIII but <i>not</i> as XIIX. </li><li>Only the I, X, or C can be used as subtractive numerals. </li><li>A subtractive I can only be used to the left of a V or X. Likewise a X can only appear to the left of a L or C, and a C can only be used to the left of a D or M. For example, 49 must be written as XLIX and <i>not</i> as IL. </li></ol><p>Your goal is to write a program which converts Roman numbers to base 10 integers.</p><p><b>Input:</b></p><p>The input to this problem will consist of the following:</p><ul><li>A line with a single integer "<i>N</i>" (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 1000), where <i>N</i> indicates how many Roman numbers are to be converted. </li><li>A series of <i>N</i> lines of input with each line containing one Roman number.

Of course before you spend one billion dollars building the thing, you want to run some simulations first to make sure everything will work as designed. For this phase of the project, you will be simulating part of the aiming system which uses mirrors and other optics to change the direction of the laser beam.</p><p>The simulation consists of a flat square table with mirrors, beam splitters, and beam detectors arranged on the tabletop, and with each object represented by a one dimensional line segment. The list below describes each of the object types in detail:</p><ul><li><i>mirror</i> : A mirror object will reflect any laser beam striking its surface. The reflected beam leaves at the same angle of incidence as the incoming beam. Note that <b>both sides of a mirror object are reflective</b>. </li><li><p><i>detector</i> : A detector is an opaque object which absorbs any laser beam striking it. The simulation must also keep track of which detectors are struck by a laser for program output purposes. Note that a laser beam strike on either side of a detector counts as a "hit".</p></li><li><p><i>splitter</i> : When a laser beam strikes a splitter, it divides into two beams. One of the new beams will reflect from the splitter surface (as with a mirror), and the other beam will pass through the splitter without changing direction. A splitter will function the same way regardless which side of it is struck by a laser beam.</p></li></ul><p>See the figures below for examples of a laser beam's interaction with each of the possible object types:</p><p></p><table class="example" noborder="" align="center"><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/p3856a.png> </td><td><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/p3856a.png></td><td><img src="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/p3856a.png></td></tr><tr><td><i>Mirror Object</i></td><td><i>Splitter Object</i></td><td><i>Detector Object</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>For each simulation, a single laser beam enters the tabletop area. The program must compute the path taken by the laser beam (including secondary beams due to splitters), and it must determine which detectors are struck by a laser beam.</p><p>You can make the following assumptions in the program:</p><ol><li>The tabletop surface is a 100 by 100 square, and unless otherwise specified all coordinates in the program's input are given as integers within the tabletop area (i.e. between 0 and 100 inclusive). </li><li>There will be no overlaps between the line segment objects. </li><li>The laser which enters the tabletop area always starts from the edge of the table. </li><li>The simulation of each data set ends when all laser beams have either exited the table top area or have terminated at a detector. </li><li>For each data set there will be no more than 100 total reflections among all laser beams in that data set. </li><li>A laser beam will never intersect any object on a vertex and will never be collinear with an object's line segment. </li><li>Each data set will contain at least one detector object. </li></ol><p><b>Input:</b></p><p>Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of data sets. Each data set consists of the following components:</p><ul><li>A single line with four numbers "<i>x,y i,j</i>" where <i>x,y</i> is a point along the table edge at which the laser beam enters, and <i>i,j</i> is a vector with integer components (- 1024 &le; <i>i,j</i> &le; 1024) specifying the direction of the incoming laser beam, where <i>i</i> corresponds to the x-axis direction and &nbsp;<i>j</i> corresponds to the y-axis direction. </li><li>A line with a single integer <i>P</i> (1 &le; <i>P</i> &le; 100) giving the total number of objects in this data set. </li><li>A series of <i>P</i> lines, each representing one object, with the first line describing object 1, the second line describing object 2, and so on. Each line begins with a single letter specifying the object type where a "<tt>M</tt>" indicates a mirror object, "<tt>S</tt>" a splitter, and "<tt>D</tt>" a detector. This is followed by two coordinate pairs of the form "<i>x,y</i>", specifying the two end points of the object's line segment. </li></ul><p><b>Output:</b></p><p>For each data set in the input, output the heading "<tt>DATA SET #<i>k</i></tt>" where <i>k</i> is 1 for the first data set, 2 for the second, etc. If in this data set none of the detector objects are struck by any laser beams, output the message "<tt>NO BEAMS DETECTED</tt>". Otherwise, output the object number, one per line, of each detector struck by a laser beam. The list of detectors should be sorted by their object numbers and output in ascending order.

<p>While the Romans may have had a fancy number system, the Visigoths (led by Alareiks, known now as Alaric I) managed to take Rome on August 24, 410. This was the first time that Rome had been taken by foreign troops in eight hundred years.</p><p>You will simulate a considerably less bloody (and less realistic) rout of soldiers by a potentially overwhelming force.</p><p>Consider a group of invaders of strength <i>I</i>, and an opposing force of strength <i>J</i>, with distance <i>D</i> between them and a defensive stronghold of strength <i>S</i>. The Routing Force <i>F</i> of the invaders can be calculated as their strength times the distance:</p><p><i>F</i> = <i>ID</i></p><p>and the Blocking Force <i>B</i> of the defenders can be calculated as their strength times the <b>square</b> of their defenses:</p><p><i>B</i> = <i>JS</i><sup>2</sup></p><p>If <i>F</i> is less than or equal to <i>B</i>, the invaders' rout fails, and they are driven off. If <i>F</i> is greater than <i>B</i>, the rout is successful, all defenders of the stronghold are driven off, and the invaders can continue. However, their strength is reduced by removing a fraction equal to the ratio of the defenders' Blocking Force to their Routing Force for that attack. The resulting number should be rounded <b>up</b> to the nearest integer, to ensure that a successful rout leaves at least one soldier:</p><p><i>I<sub>new</sub></i> = &#8968; <i>I</i>(1 - <i>B</i>/<i>F</i>) &#8969;</p><p>If the invaders make it through a stronghold, its location is considered the starting point for calculations regarding the next group of defenders, and so on, until either the invading force makes it all the way through the defenders or is completely routed.</p><p>Your goal is to determine whether or not a given invading force can make it through a particular gauntlet of defenders.</p><p>For the purposes of simplification, all defending strongholds in this simulation are considered to be in a straight line from the starting position of the invaders, and must be encountered in order from nearest to furthest away.

These files generally have a canonical location, known as the <i>absolute path</i> (such as <tt>/usr/games/bin/kobodl</tt>), which can be used to refer to the file no matter where the user is on a system.</p><p>Most operating system environments allow you to refer to files in other directories without having to be so explicit about their locations, however. This is often stored in a variable called <b><tt>PATH</tt></b>, and is an ordered list of locations (always absolute paths in this problem) to search for a given name. We will call these <i>search paths</i>.</p><p>In the brand-new <tt>crash</tt> shell, paths are handled somewhat differently. Users still provide an ordered list of locations that they wish to search for files (their search paths); when a particular filename is requested, however, <tt>crash</tt> tries to be even more helpful than usual. The process it follows is as follows:</p><ul><li>If there is an exact match for the filename, it is returned. Exact matches in locations earlier in the list are preferred. (There are no duplicate filenames in a single location.)</li> <li>If there are no exact matches, a filename that has a single <i>extra</i> character is returned. That character may be at any point in the filename, but the order of the non-extra characters must be identical to the requested filename. As before, matches in locations earlier in the list are preferred; if there are multiple matches in the highest-ranked location, all such matches in that location are returned.</li> <li>If there are no exact matches or one-extra-character matches, files that have <i>two</i> extra characters are looked for. The same rules of precedence and multiple matches apply as for the one-extra-character case.</li> <li>If no files meet the three criteria above, no filenames are returned. Two characters is considered the limit of "permissiveness" for the <tt>crash</tt> shell.</li></ul><p>So, for example, given the two files <tt>bang</tt> and <tt>tang</tt>, they are both one character away from the filename <tt>ang</tt> and two from <tt>ag</tt>. (All characters in this problem will be lowercase.) In the sample data below, both <tt>cat</tt> and <tt>rat</tt> are one character away from <tt>at</tt>.</p><p>Given a complete list of locations and files in those locations on a system, a set of users each with their own ordered lists of search paths, and a set of files that they wish to search for, what filenames would <tt>crash</tt> return?</p><p>For the purposes of simplification, all locations will be described by a single alphabetic string, as will filenames and usernames. Real operating system paths often have many components separated by characters such as slashes, but this problem does not. Also note that users may accidentally refer to nonexistent locations in their search paths; these (obviously) contain no files.</p><p><b>Input:</b></p><p>All alphabetic strings in the input will have at least one and at most 20 characters, and will contain no special characters such as slashes or spaces; all letters will be lowercase.</p><p>Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100) indicating the number of data sets.

While the clock may state that it is, say, thirty minutes until liftoff for a rocket or shuttle, there are built-in <i>holds</i> where the clock is stopped for a set amount of time. For example, there may be a 15-minute hold when the countdown reaches the 8-minute mark. The end result is that more time passes from the beginning of the countdown to the end than the numbers on the clock would imply.</p><p>LAI-BACH uses a simple "command file" format to manage holds for their countdowns on their computer systems. All commands start with a positive integer no greater than 1440 (countdowns longer than a day make Doctor Doom angry), followed by a directive. The format of the commands is as follows:</p><p></p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><tt><i>t</i> START</tt></td><td><i>t</i> is the start time on the countdown clock, in minutes.</td></tr><tr><td><tt><i>t</i> HOLD <i>n</i></tt></td><td>A mandatory hold for <i>n</i> minutes at countdown clock time <i>t</i>.</td></tr><tr><td><tt><i>t</i> HOLD <i>n</i> IF <i>condition</i></tt></td><td>A hold at countdown clock time <i>t</i> for <i>n</i> minutes if <i>condition</i> is true.</td></tr><tr><td><tt><i>t</i> HOLD <i>n</i> IF NOT <i>condition</i></tt></td><td>A hold at countdown clock time <i>t</i> for <i>n</i> minutes if <i>condition</i> is <b>not</b> true.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>All conditions are represented by short strings of lowercase letters, no more than 20 characters long; their actual values are not provided in the command structure, as they are determined by actual conditions during the launch (whether the fuel tanks have been topped off, whether the Fantastic Four is currently fighting Doctor Doom, and so on), but they are always either true or false and do not change during the course of a single countdown. A hold time <i>n</i> is a positive integer no more than 60 (minutes), as long delays also irritate Victor.</p><p>Given a particular command file, you are to determine both the shortest possible time and the longest possible time that the countdown can run. The commands may be present in any order, but there will always be one and only one <tt>START</tt> directive; there will be precisely as much whitespace on each line as dictated by the format given above.

<P>
In this problem you'll have to implement the Abacus Sort algorithm, also known as the Bead Sort algorithm. 

<P>
This abacus includes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> poles, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the largest number to be sorted. Unlike conventional abacuses, a number is  represented by a corresponding number of beads on a  separate row, starting at the left (pole 1), and moving towards the right.

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

 ALT="\epsfbox{p3863a.eps}">
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>
</DIV>

<P>
Once all numbers have been placed on their own row, we tilt the abacus and let the beads fall. In this case, four beads move downward. 

<P>
At this point, the top row of the abacus will represent the smallest number, and we can read off all the numbers, in sorted order, by reading the values on the various rows, from the top down.

When reading input, the first item read will be the item at the top of the abacus when it is tilted and the last item read will be the item at the bottom. 

<P>
The end of input will be indicated by end of file.

</H2>

<P>
For each test case in the input file, you should produce the listing of the sorted values in ascending order. Each value should be displayed in its own row of text, with an <TT>X</TT> representing a pole with a bead and a hyphen representing a pole without a bead. There should be exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> poles represented for each integer, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the largest number to be sorted in the set. At the end of the row, have a blank, a greater than (`<code>&gt;</code>') sign, a blank, and the integer being represented.

<P>
At the end of the final depiction of the abacus, have a line telling how many beads moved as a result of doing the sort. For example, in the example above (the first example in the sample input), 4 beads move. Your statement should have the form: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<TT>A total of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>xx</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> beads slid during the sort.</TT> 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
where <TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>xx</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark></TT> is replaced by the number of beads that move. You should not change ``<TT>beads</TT>" to ``<TT>bead</TT>" in the case of 1 bead sliding. 

<P>
Have a blank line between output from each input set.

</H1><P>Your little sister Annie has just learned about different number bases. When you ask her what time it is, she tells you it's 5. ``Five?" you ask. ``Yes," she explains, since the clock shows ``1:01" which, she proudly explains, ``is 5 in base-2." Since you have to live with your sister and know she's going to learn more bases, you decide to write a program to make sense of her answers.<P>Your program should find all the times in an inclusive range that could be considered to valid numbers in a given base (ignoring the colon).

<P>Dr. Hain and Dr. White have decided to retire from judging the regional programming contest and instead want to become dog show judges. Unfortunately, dog shows use different criteria from programming contests (dogs very seldom have compiler errors, although some may have wrong output), so they need a way to ensure they are judging the dogs consistently. Since they are still the chief judges of this contest, they have asked you to write a program to check the consistency of their dog judging.<P><P><BR>Your program should create charts showing the consistency between the two judges.

<P>Run length encoding (RLE) of text strings replaces sequences of characters by a number (the number of repetitions of the character) followed by the character that is repeated. Thus, the string <TT>AAAAABAAABBCEEEEE</TT> would be replaced by <TT>4AB3ABBC5E</TT>. Note that <TT>BB</TT> is not replaced by <TT>2B</TT> since that is no shorter.<P>Under some circumstances, modified run length encoding (MRLE) can do better by replacing repeated adjacent substrings in a similar way. We now need a pair of numbers associated with a repeated substring: the number of repetitions, and the length of the substring. The string <TT>ABABAB</TT> (length 6) can be written (To be able to unambiguously display sequences of numbers (which may have more than one decimal digit), we will always display a number followed by a space.) as <TT>3 2 AB</TT> (length 4 (For simplicity, we will only consider cases where a number can be encoded in a byte, as well as being distinguishable from characters.)), being 3 repetitions of a length-2 substring (<TT>AB</TT>).<P>From longest to shortest substring length, the algorithm will scan the target string from left to right looking for sequences of substrings of that length. When a repetition of a substring is found, it is replaced the two numbers associated with the substring, followed by the substring itself. This process is repeated until finally all length-1 substrings have been considered.<P>For example, the string <TT>BABABABAABABABAB</TT> is first reduced to <TT>B2 7 ABABABAB</TT> (the longest repeating substring is <TT>ABABABA</TT>; the <TT>ABABABAABABABA</TT> is replaced by <TT>2 7 ABABABA</TT>). This reduced string is then further reduced to <TT>B2 7 2 4 ABAB</TT> (the longest repeating substring after the first reduction is <TT>ABAB</TT>; the <TT>ABABABAB</TT> is replaced by <TT>2 4 ABAB</TT>). No further reductions in the length of the compressed string can be made (The replacement of <TT>ABAB</TT> by <TT>2 2 AB</TT> does not reduce the length).<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Each target string may be spread over several lines.

Jane has just bought three rectangular Persian carpets that she wants to show off in the new house that she's building. She wants to put all the carpets into a square room, such that none of the carpets overlap, and that all carpet edges are parallel to the room walls. Given the sizes of the carpets, she wants to know the dimensions of the smallest room that will hold the carpets. For example, if the carpets are sized <!-- MATH

You want to produce flash cards having pronounceable (but perhaps meaningless) words for children to practice their phonetics. Here we define a pronounceable word as one having interleaved consonants and vowels. However, there are also 2-letter compound consonants (e.g., ``ch", ``th", ``st"), and 2-letter compound vowels (having a vowel sounds such as ``ea", and ``ou").

There is no requirement as to how many times each vowel may/must be used. If there are more than 100 words in the output, write just the first 100 words. Words should be written 10 per line for all lines of output (except possibly the last). Leave a blank line between output for each data set.

In the spirit of congeniality, players at a round table poker game decide to even out their winnings after a game ends. The scheme involves sharing their winningÃ¢Â€Â”each player divides his money into three parts according to a specified pattern <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I> : <I>M</I> : <I>R</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> indicates the part he shares with his neighbor on the left, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> indicates the part he keeps for himself, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> indicates the part he shares with his neighbor on the right. However, if the left or right portion contains loose change (i.e., partial dollars), the player keeps that, and only gives whole dollar amounts to his/her neighbors. 

<P>
For example, suppose there are four players seated counterclockwise around the table with winnings of $60, $60, $120, and $90, respectively. If the sharing scheme is <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2 : 3 : 1</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, each shares <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1/3</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (that is, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2/6</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>) of his money with the player on the left, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1/6</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> of his money with the player on his right, and keeps the rest of his money for himself. After sharing, the money is distributed in the following amounts: $65, $80, $100, and $85. The players may decide to repeat this scheme more than once. If they share a second time, the money is distributed in these amounts: $74, $84, $92, and $80. 

<P>
Your job is to find how the money is finally distributed among the players after sharing is complete:

When you use a spell checker, and the lookup word is wrong, it usually makes suggestions. Our task is, given a list of correctly spelled words (dictionary words) and a possibly misspelled lookup word, which of the dictionary words is/are closest to the lookup word. By ``closest" we mean that the lookup word has lowest penalty value relative to the dictionary word. Penalty values are calculated for the following errors:

<P>
Almost everyone is familiar with the ``seven puzzle." The puzzle board has <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> rows and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> columns of squares, each square (except one) containing a tile marked with a letter or digit or symbol, and one empty square. In each move, any one of the tiles neighboring the empty square can be moved (by sliding it) from its square into the empty square giving a different puzzle configuration. 

<P>
In this problem each of the tiles in such a puzzle is marked with a binary digit (0 or 1). After you make exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> moves of the tiles, treat each row as a separate <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-digit binary number (treating the empty location as if it contained zero). What we want to know is the maximum number of unique binary integers that can possibly be created in this manner, considering all possible sequences of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>K</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> moves. 

<P>
Let's consider a simple example. Suppose the initial puzzle configuration looked like that shown below, and that you make exactly one move. There are three possible choices for that move. The first choice is to move the 0 on the first row right; this yields the binary numbers 001 and 010 (treating the empty square as if it contained zero). The second choice is to move the 1 on the first row left. This yields the binary number 010 on each row. The third choice is to move the 1 on the second row up, yielding 011 and 000. So making one move could yield at most four binary numbers: 001, 010, 011 and 000.

The City of Octavia is one of the most orderly and well-organized cities in the world. The traffic in Octavia flows on 8 major avenues, named A through H and 8 major streets, numbered 1 through 8, all of which are two-way. The avenues stretch in the East/West direction and are perpendicular to the streets, which go North/South. Each street and each avenue has a speed limit Ã¢Â€Â“ either 20 or 30 miles per hour (Octavia is not known to be fast-paced). The city infrastructure is so well designed that the distance between any two consecutive streets or avenues is exactly 1 mile. Thus, Octavians live in large city blocks that are each one square mile each (as illustrated in the diagram below), but drive only on the 8 streets and 8 avenues. Each intersection in Octavia is labeled with the name of the avenue and street that meet at that point; for example H8 is in the southeast corner of the city, while D5 is near the center. 

<P>
The Octavia City Council is conducting a traffic study and wants to install traffic lights on some (or all) intersections in Octavia. The city has already contracted Imperial Light Machines (ILM) to deliver the traffic lights. The ILM traffic lights are very simple: they only have red and green signals and are designed to cycle from green to red and back to green every 4 minutes, showing green for 2 minutes, then showing red for another 2 minutes. While this is adjustable, the Octavian Traffic Committee (OTC) has determined that 4 minutes is precisely the cycle time that they would need to control all the traffic in the city. Each traffic light is reset at a particular time every 24 hours and starts alternating from that point on, giving a green light to the North/South direction first. The city council is concerned with optimizing the traffic flow and wants to calculate the time it would take an average citizen to travel from their home to their work place, given a particular configuration of the ILM traffic lights.

<P>
You have been contracted by the OTC to provide key simulation data that will help the Octavia City Council determine the number and placement of the ILM Traffic Lights. To do that, you will be given a series of test cases that include speed limit data, the proposed location of traffic lights, the initial reset time of each traffic light, a starting point and time, and a destination point for a driving test (both points are intersections). You are to determine the minimum time it would take an
Octavian driver to traverse the major streets and avenues from the starting point to the destination point with the given configuration. Remember that Octavians are very strict and lawabiding citizens Ã¢Â€Â“ they always drive at exactly the speed limit and always obey traffic lights. Keep in mind that no left or right turns are permitted on a red light in the City of Octavia.

In a remote area of Canada, a bridge between two islands is being repaired. During the repair process the bridge can only take traffic in one lane. The bridge runs east and west, and there is a flag person with a radio at each end of the bridge to control the traffic flow. 

<P>
Cars may arrive at the east end of the bridge with their driver wishing to go west. Cars may also arrive at the west end of the bridge with their drivers heading east. This being Canada, all drivers obey the speed limit exactly Ã¢Â€Â“ it takes precisely 60 seconds to cross the bridge in either direction. 

<P>
Of course, when the traffic flow is from east to west, any cars arriving on the west end must wait; similarly, if the traffic is moving across the bridge from west to eat, cars arriving at the east end must wait. The very instant that the last car going a certain direction (say, west to east) has crossed the bridge, the traffic can then run in the opposite direction (east to west). 

<P>
The input data for this problem consists of a sequence of arrival events, each event identifying the time a car arrives and at which end of the bridge it arrives. Your task is to determine when the last of the cars to arrive has left the bridge.

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Example</SPAN>

It is possible to have more than one car waiting at either end of the bridge.

Mr. Horologia's House of Clocks contains various cuckoo clocks that customers have brought in for repair. Since they are in the clock shop, one might rightly assume that these clocks don't quite run as they should. In fact, a fast clock may take 3,500 seconds to advance one hour, instead of 3,600 seconds. A slow clock might take 3,750 seconds. Each clock makes a sound like a cuckoo once each hour, precisely on the hour. That is, a clock will ``cuckoo" when it displays 12:00, 1:00, 2:00, and so forth. Of course, the displayed time when it cuckoos will not necessarily correspond to the real time, since the clock may be running fast or slow. 

<P>
Every midnight on Sunday morning, Mr. Horologia sets all clocks to exactly 12:00. He has sufficient assistants awake at that hour that all clocks can be set simultaneously. Some time later, possibly that same day but quite possibly several days later, all clocks in the room will cuckoo at precisely the same instant in time. (All clocks initially would chime when they are set at midnight on Sunday, but the initial cuckooing does not count.) What is the first day, hour, minute, and second when all clocks simultaneously go off? The time might be several days in the future; also, midnight on the next Sunday morning might come around again before they ever cuckoo simultaneously. In this latter case, Mr. Horologia will set them all again, and the correct answer would be ``<TT>Never</TT>".

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Example</SPAN>

<P>
An easy example involves two clocks, one that advances an hour every 3,000 seconds, and a second clock that advances an hour every 4,500 seconds. For simplicity, note that these represent 50 minutes and 75 minutes, respectively. The first clock would reach 1:00 AM after 50 minutes, then 2:00 AM after 100 minutes, and 3:00 AM after 150 minutes. The second clock would reach 1:00 at 75 minutes and 2:00 at 150 minutes. Thus, 150 minutes after midnight, clock number one and clock number two both cuckoo. The correct answer is thus ``<TT>Sunday at 2:30:00 AM</TT>". 

<P>
A second example might involve four clocks, all of which are extremely fast. They advance at 600, 1200, 1800, and 600 seconds. After 30 minutes, all of them cuckoo except for the second clock. After 60 minutes, all will cuckoo. Thus the answer here is ``<TT>Sunday at 1:00:00 AM</TT>". 

<P>
Finally, suppose we have four clocks with speeds of 3601, 3559, 3600, and 3700. The answer in this case is ``<TT>Never</TT>" -- the next Sunday will occur before all clocks cuckoo.

<P>Genes are DNA sequences that cause certain traits in living organisms. For example, a specific DNA sequence, called the sickle cell gene, manifests itself in Sickle Cell Anemia, a deadly disease of the blood. Similarly, other genes are responsible for traits like blue or brown eyes, blond or brunette hair, and so on (admittedly, this is an oversimplification of the structure and function of genes, but it will do for this problem). The human DNA code, called the human genome, has already been extensively studied and fully mapped out to genes. Thus, it is possible to collect a DNA sample from a person and predict some of the traits in that individual, caused by genes found in the sample.<P>Your task is to locate and identify a number of pre-defined genes in several given DNA sequences. All DNA molecules, as well as any gene, are sequences composed from only four distinct chemicals, called nucleotides (Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine), which are labeled with the following letters: <TT>A</TT>, <TT>C</TT>, <TT>G</TT>, and <TT>T</TT>. From biology, we know a DNA molecule forms a right-handed double-helix structure where each base from one of the strands connects to exactly one corresponding base from the second strand. The bases always form <TT>A</TT>-<TT>T</TT> or <TT>C</TT>-<TT>G</TT> pairs (or, reflexively, <TT>T</TT>-<TT>A</TT>, and <TT>G</TT>-<TT>C</TT>) and thus, any gene sequence always has its complement in the pairing strand. Due to the method of collecting and examining DNA material, any given gene DNA sequence may be found in the DNA sample in either its original sequence, or in reverse, or in its complement image, or its reverse complement image. For example:<P><P><BR>The gene <TT>ACTTAGAAGGT</TT> may be found as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="105" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/3879img1.png ALT="$ \left\{\vphantom{ \begin{array}{l}

\mbox{\texttt{TGA...
... reversed)} \\
\mbox{\texttt{ACCTTCTAAGT} (reversed complement)}
\end{array}$"></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark><P><P><BR>Further, even though unlikely, some genes, or one of their alternative sequences, may be fragments of other, larger genes. Finally, the same gene may be found in the same DNA sample in multiple locations, either in its original, or one of its alternative sequences. You will be given a set of genes, one gene per input line, each labeled with a simple name. The name and the gene sequence will be separated by a colon (``<TT>:</TT>"). For example:<P><P><BR><TT>Blue_eyes:ACTTAGAAGGT</TT><P><TT>Blond_hair:CTTAAGGGCGGGCTTCTTTA</TT><P><TT>...</TT><P><P><BR>The list of genes will be followed by one or more sample DNA sequences, which are submitted to you for your evaluation. Your program must display the list of genes present in each sample DNA sequence and the location (counting from 1) of the first base of the that gene, in the order in which those genes were encoded by the sequence. For example, the sequence<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TT>ACCTTACC<SPAN ID="txt73">CTTAAGGGCGGGCTTCTTTA</SPAN>GTGCTTGAGG<SPAN ID="txt74">ACCTTCTAAGT</SPAN></TT></DIV><P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TT>TTACGGAATAACG<SPAN ID="txt75">ATTTCTTCGGGCGGGAATTC</SPAN>CAAGTCCCGGATCGA</TT></DIV><P>encodes Blond_hair , Blue_eyes, and Blond_hair at locations 9, 39, and 63, respectively. If the DNA sequence does not encode any of the known genes, simply output ``<TT>none</TT>".<P>Gene matches may overlap in a DNA sequence. For example, if a gene is <TT>ACA</TT> and the sample is <TT>ACACACA</TT>, your program should report three matches, one at index 1, one at index 3, and one at index 5.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The first line of input will contain a single integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>NG</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> indicating the number of genes that are supplied.

<P>In this problem you are given a piece of graph paper with one-inch squares.

<P>Adding hexadecimal numbers is not too difficult, but you must remember the carries! Like adding decimal numbers, carries of 1 are generated when the sum of two digits and the carry from the right exceeds the maximum value that can be represented in a single digit (15, of course, for hexadecimal digits). In this problem you will be given a pair of non-negative hexadecimal numbers and asked to determine the number of non-zero carries that are involved in adding these numbers. We don't care about the sum.<P>For example, suppose the numbers to be added are <TT>1A2B</TT> and <TT>D6E4</TT>. The following steps would be used to determine the number of carries.<P><UL><LI><TT>B</TT> (decimal 11) and <TT>4</TT> are added, yielding a sum of 15 (there is no carry into the low-order position). Since this is less than 16, no carry is generated. </LI><LI><TT>2</TT> and <TT>E</TT> (decimal 14) are added (with no carry from the preceding step), yielding a sum of 16. Since this is too large for a single hexadecimal digit (it's larger than 15), a carry is generated to the next step. </LI><LI><TT>A</TT> (decimal 10) and <TT>6</TT> are added, along with the carry from the previous step. The sum is 10 + 6 + 1 = 17, and a carry is generated. </LI><LI>Finally, <TT>1</TT> and <TT>D</TT> (decimal 13) and the carry from the previous step are added yielding 1 + 13 + 1 = 15, and no carry is generated. </LI></UL><P>So a total of 2 carries were generated, and this is the answer for this case.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>There will be multiple cases to consider, each numbered sequentially starting with 1.

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. From this state, remove stones one by one following the rules explained below, until only one remains. In step 1, remove stone <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. In step 2, locate the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th next stone clockwise from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and remove it. In subsequent steps, start from the slot of the stone removed in the last step, make <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> hops clockwise on the remaining stones and remove the one you reach. In other words, skip <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>k</I> - 1)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> remaining stones clockwise and remove the next one. Repeat this until only one stone is left and answer its number. 

<P>
For example, the answer for the case <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> = 8</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> = 5</SPAN>

<P>Here is a very simple variation of the game backgammon, named ``Minimal Backgammon". The game is played by only one player, using only one of the dice and only one checker (the token used by the player).<P>The game board is a line of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>N</I> + 1)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> squares labeled as 0 (the start) to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> (the goal). At the beginning, the checker is placed on the start (square 0). The aim of the game is to bring the checker to the goal (square <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>). The checker proceeds as many squares as the roll of the dice. The dice generates six integers from 1 to 6 with equal probability.<P>The checker should not go beyond the goal.

You are constructing a triangular pyramid with a sheet of craft paper with grid lines. Its base and sides are all of triangular shape. You draw the base triangle and the three sides connected to the base on the paper, cut along the outer six edges, fold the edges of the base, and assemble them up as a pyramid. 

<P>
You are given the coordinates of the base's three vertices, and are to determine the coordinates of the other three. All the vertices must have integral X- and Y-coordinate values between -100 and +100 inclusive. Your goal is to minimize the height of the pyramid satisfying these conditions. Figure 3 shows some examples.

There are several spanning trees for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>G</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Four of them are depicted in Figure 6(a)Ã¢ÂˆÂ¼(d). The spanning tree <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>a</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> in Figure 6(a) has three edges whose weights are 3, 6 and 7. The largest weight is 7 and the smallest weight is 3 so that the slimness of the tree <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>a</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is 4. The slimnesses of spanning trees <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>b</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>c</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>d</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> shown in Figure 6(b), (c) and (d) are 3, 2 and 1, respectively. You can easily see the slimness of any other spanning tree is greater than or equal to 1, thus the spanning tree <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I><SUB>d</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> in Figure 6(d) is one of the slimmest spanning trees whose slimness is 1. 

<P>
Your job is to write a program that computes the smallest slimness.

<P>You are working for an amusement park as an operator of an <SPAN CLASS="textit">obakeyashiki</SPAN>, or a haunted house, in which guests walk through narrow and dark corridors. The house is proud of their lively ghosts, which are actually robots remotely controlled by the operator, hiding here and there in the corridors. One morning, you found that the ghosts are not in the positions where they are supposed to be. Ah, yesterday was Halloween. Believe or not, paranormal spirits have moved them around the corridors in the night. You have to move them into their right positions before guests come. Your manager is eager to know how long it takes to restore the ghosts.<P>In this problem, you are asked to write a program that, given a floor map of a house, finds the smallest number of steps to move all ghosts to the positions where they are supposed to be.<P>A floor consists of a matrix of square cells. A cell is either a wall cell where ghosts cannot move into or a corridor cell where they can.<P>At each step, you can move any number of ghosts simultaneously. Every ghost can either stay in the current cell, or move to one of the corridor cells in its 4-neighborhood (i.e. immediately left, right, up or down), if the ghosts satisfy the following conditions:<P><P><BR><OL><LI>No more than one ghost occupies one position at the end of the step. </LI><LI>No pair of ghosts exchange their positions one another in the step. </LI></OL><P><P><BR>For example, suppose ghosts are located as shown in the following (partial) map, where a sharp sign (`<TT>#</TT>') represents a wall cell and `<TT>a</TT>', `<TT>b</TT>', and `<TT>c</TT>' ghosts.<P><P><BR><PRE>

<P>
The main land of Japan called Honshu is an island surrounded by the sea. In such an island, it is natural to ask a question: ``Where is the most distant point from the sea?" The answer to this question for Honshu was found in 1996. The most distant point is located in former Usuda Town, Nagano Prefecture, whose distance from the sea is 114.86 km. 

<P>
In this problem, you are asked to write a program which, given a map of an island, finds the most distant point from the sea in the island, and reports its distance from the sea. In order to simplify the problem, we only consider maps representable by convex polygons.

<P>One of the tasks students routinely carry out in their mathematics classes is to solve a polynomial equation. It is, given a polynomial, say <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I><SUP>2</SUP> - 4<I>X</I> + 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, to find its roots <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(2&#177;<IMG WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/38/3891img1.png ALT="$ \sqrt{{3}}$">)</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.<P>If the students' task is to find the roots of a given polynomial, the teacher's task is then to find a polynomial that has a given root.

She wanted to make higher-degree equations whose solutions are a little more complicated. As usual in problems in mathematics classes, she wants to maintain all coefficients to be integers and keep the degree of the polynomial as small as possible (provided it has the specified root).

<P>Recently retired rascal Al acquired a nifty new notion which will wonderfully pique past passions: For a modest contribution he designs monumental business names, or rather, he'll use your program in his noble endeavor.<P>As a business name he takes the possessive version of either the client's first or last name, followed by as many different attributes as possible (each selected from a separate list of synonyms), and terminated by the product name or one of its equivalents. He only accepts those business names where each attribute and the product start with the same letter, irrespective of upper or lower case, and if at all possible even the selected first or last name of the client must start with that same letter.<P>Al gets a kickback from the sign companies -- the longer the sign the more of a kick. Therefore, to serve at Al's pleasure your program must compute the maximum number of non-blank characters (including the possessive quote) for each of Al's monumental business names.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The first line of input contains a positive integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

<P>Mobile phones prevail in everyday life. Every mobile phone has a number pad for users to dial the telephone number. Figure 1 shows a typical layout of number pads, which can be represented as 4 by 3 rectangular cells. We know that some mobile phone numbers are easy to memorize, since entering in sequence of digits implies an easy-to-remember geometric figure.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="232" HEIGHT="330" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/39/p3903a.png ALT="\epsfbox{p3903a.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>For each phone number, we can make a corresponding geometric figure, Phone Plot, which is a sequence of connected line segments. Assume that a phone number with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> digits is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I><SUB>1</SUB>&nbsp;<I>d</I><SUB>2</SUB>&nbsp;<I>d</I><SUB>3</SUB>...<I>d</I><SUB>n-1</SUB>&nbsp;<I>d</I><SUB>n</SUB></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

If the Phone Plot is reduced to a single point for a number (e.g., 0000000000), then MNDS of such a point Phone Plot is defined 0.<P>We want to classify the phone number into three disjoint classes; <TT>EXCELLENT</TT>, <TT>GOOD</TT> and <TT>BAD</TT> by the complexity of Phone Plot. Thus if the MNDS of Phone Plot is at most 3, then this number is classified to <TT>EXCELLENT</TT>. If MNDS is exactly 4, then this number is classified to <TT>GOOD</TT>.

The city of Songpa is now carrying out a project to build a bicycle transportation system called Ã¢Â€Â˜green Songpa.Ã¢Â€Â™ By the end of this year, citizens and visitors alike will be able to pick up and drop off bicycles throughout the city. Recently, it was decided to attach a number tag to each bicycle for management use. The bicycles will be under control of the cityÃ¢Â€Â™s traffic system. 

<P>
The number tag contains a tile code of length <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>

<SPAN CLASS="MATH">2&#215;5</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> plate and a tile code of length 5 are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. The code will always be read from left to right. However, there is no distinction between the top side and the bottom side of the code. The code may be turned upside down. The code shown in Figure 3 is essentially the same code as in Figure 2.

<P>Let DC (direct current) circuits be given. Each DC circuit generates a set of output signals. The DC circuits consist of a set of devices connected in parallel or in serial but they have no feedback loops. Each device generates a specific signal and the set of output signals of a circuit is determined by the kinds of devices and the topology of the device connection.

You are going to draw a figure on a monitor using a keyboard of a computer. The figure which you want to draw is a polygonal chain which consists of horizontal or vertical line segments only. In order to draw the figure, you should press some keys successively. A sequence of keys consists of pairs of a direction key and a digit key. The direction keys consist of four keys which are labeled as `<TT>N</TT>', `<TT>S</TT>', `<TT>E</TT>', and `<TT>W</TT>'. The symbols `<TT>N</TT>', `<TT>S</TT>', `<TT>E</TT>', and `<TT>W</TT>' represent North, South, East, and West respectively. The digit keys consist of 10 keys which are labeled as `<TT>0</TT>', `<TT>1</TT>' , <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, `<TT>9</TT>'.

<P>
Initially, the cursor is located at the center of a monitor screen. If you will enter ``<TT>S4E3</TT>", i.e. youÃ¢Â€Â™ll press the keys `<TT>S</TT>', `<TT>4</TT>', `<TT>E</TT>', and `<TT>3</TT>' in order, an L-shaped chain will appear on the monitor. When you first press the two keys `<TT>S</TT>' and `<TT>4</TT>', a vertical line segment with length 4 from the current cursor position, i.e. the center of the screen, to the south is drawn and the cursor is located at the endpoint of that segment. When you press next the two keys `<TT>E</TT>' and `<TT>3</TT>', a horizontal line segment with length 3 from the current cursor position to the east is drawn. 

<P>
Your computer program always keeps the polygonal chain simple. In other words, the polygonal chain on the monitor doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t have either a cycle or an overlapped segment. Whenever the program finds a cycle or an overlap in the drawing, it instantly gets rid of it. For example, if you enter ``<TT>E6S2W5S2E2N7</TT>", two intersection points <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> occur in order by the last segment (see Figure 1). The program first gets rid of the cycle <!-- MATH
 $(p, d, e, f)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>p</I>, <I>d</I>, <I>e</I>, <I>f</I> )</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> containing the intersection <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, then the cycle <!-- MATH
 $(q, b, c, p)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>q</I>, <I>b</I>, <I>c</I>, <I>p</I>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> containing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> as shown in Figure 1. Hence, the resulting chain on the monitor is the same as the chain by ``<TT>E3N3</TT>". If you enter ``<TT>E4S2W3S2E6N6W4S7</TT>", the program gets rid of the cycle <!-- MATH
 $(p, b, c, d, e, f, g, h)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>p</I>, <I>b</I>, <I>c</I>, <I>d</I>, <I>e</I>, <I>f</I>, <I>g</I>, <I>h</I>)</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> created by the first intersection point <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> as shown in Figure 2 (a). After removing this cycle, the other intersections disappear. The resulting chain is the same as that by ``<TT>E3S5</TT>". If you enter ``<TT>N5S9</TT>"(resp. ``<TT>!
 N9S5</TT>"), the resulting chain is identical to that by ``<TT>S4</TT>"(resp. ``<TT>N4</TT>") as shown in Figure 2 (b).

<P>The cook at the <SPAN CLASS="textit">Frobbozz Magic Pancake House</SPAN> sometimes falls asleep on the job while cooking pancakes. As a result, one side of a stack of pancakes is often burned.

<P>
Deep in the Amazon jungle, exceptionally tall trees grow that support a rich biosphere of figs and juniper bugs, which happen to be the culinary delight of brown monkeys. 

<P>
Reaching the canopy of these trees requires the monkeys to perform careful navigation through the tall tree's fragile vine system. These vines operate like a see-saw: an unbalancing of weight at any vine junction would snap the vine from the tree, and the monkeys would plummet to the ground below. The monkeys have figured out that if they work together to keep the vines properly balanced, they can <SPAN  CLASS="textit">all</SPAN> feast on the figs and juniper bugs in the canopy of the trees. 

<P>
A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">vine junction</SPAN> supports exactly two sub-vines, each of which must contain the same number of monkeys, or else the vine will break, leaving a pile of dead monkeys on the jungle ground. For purposes of this problem, a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">vine junction</SPAN> is denoted by a pair of matching square brackets <TT>[ ]</TT>, which may contain nested information about junctions further down its <SPAN  CLASS="textit">sub-vines</SPAN>. The nesting of vines will go no further than 25 levels deep.

<P>Just when you thought we had run out of model rocket height problems<SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark><P>Yet another method used to determine the height achieved by a model rocket is the vertical line method. Two observers A and B are spaced <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> feet apart along a base line along one edge of the flat test field. The launch platform is equidistant from observers A and B and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> feet from the base line. Each observer has a theodolite or some other device for measuring angle above the horizontal (elevation angle) of a distant object and the azimuth angle (the angle the vertical plane of the sight line makes with the line from A through B measured counter-clockwise). Each measuring device is on a stand. A's device is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>HA</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> feet above the level of the launch platform and B's device is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>HB</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> feet above the level of the launch platform. When a rocket is fired, near the top of its flight, it deploys a parachute and emits a puff of smoke. Each observer measures the elevation angle and azimuth angle of the puff of smoke from their location. If the peak location is on the wrong side of the baseline or outside the lines determined by A and B perpendicular to the base line, it is out of bounds and disqualified. From this information, the height of the rocket may be determined as follows:<P>Each sight line determines a vertical plane. These two planes intersect in a vertical line (thus the name of the method). Each sight line intersects this vertical line in a point. If these points are more than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>ERRDIST</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> feet apart, an error is assumed and the flight is rejected. Otherwise, the point halfway between the two points where a sight line intersects the vertical line is computed.

The conventional western musical scale is based on 12 tones: 

<P>
<TT>A A# B C C# D D# E F F# G G#</TT> 

<P>
The sequence repeats indefinitely - the next note higher than <TT>G#</TT> is also called <TT>A</TT>. 

<P>
Each step from one note to another in this sequence is called a half-step. The <TT>#</TT> symbol is called a ``sharp" and actually means ``raised a half step". Hence ``<TT>A#</TT>" is ``A raised a half-step". There is a similar symbol ``Ã¯Â¬Â‚at" meaning ``lowered a half-step" that we will render as ``<TT>b</TT>" in this problem, though it is normally written as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/39/p3919.png
 ALT="$ \flat$"></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

<P>
Given that meaning for <TT>#</TT> and <TT>b</TT>, it is possible for notes to actually be referred to by more than one name. <TT>A#</TT> and <TT>Bb</TT> refer to the same note. <TT>B#</TT> means the same as <TT>C</TT>. <TT>Fb</TT> means the same as <TT>E</TT>. 

<P>
A common task for musical arrangers is to transpose a work of music - to raise or lower the entire work by some number of half-steps in order to fit better into the range of a particular singer or musical instrument. A proper transposition will preserve the number of half-steps between any two successive notes in the work.

You fell asleep at your desk (again!) and were awakened by the sound of the newly installed security-cam robots rolling out into the office corridors. You know youÃ¢Â€Â™ll be in big trouble if any of these robots manages to record your image. Luckily, you are able to quickly call up on your desktop computer the route each robot is programmed to follow. You need to plan your own movements to stay out of a direct line of sight of any of the robots. 

<P>
The robots move in discrete steps of unit size, moving either to the north, east, west, or south. You may move, also in discrete steps of unit size, in one of these same directions (walls permitting), but you also have the option of remaining in place for a step. You and all robots move simultaneously. 

<P>
Neither you nor the robots may move through walls, nor can either you or the robots move outside the building. 

<P>
The robots take a photograph in each of the <TT>NSEW</TT> directions immediately after moving. To be captured in a photo, you would have to be directly along a <TT>NS</TT> or <TT>EW</TT> line from a robot with no walls between you. You are also considered to have been spotted if, at the end of any movement, you are directly on top of a robot.

Dear Mom, 

I just wanted to let you know that I am alive and well. Jane is 
well also. IÃ¢Â€Â™m glad they were able to relocate us. My 
only complaint is that I wish they could have found someplace 
more exciting than Kansas for us to live in! If you really need 
to contact us, you can do so by telephone. The number is

Frederico de Vinci (one of LeonardoÃ¢Â€Â™s less talented cousins) is a budding alchemist who spends his days mixing a variety of chemicals hoping to stumble upon the formula to change lead into gold. Near his worktable, he keeps a cheap ceramic jar where he deposits the useless and rather noxious results of his failed experiments. 

<P>
He has had a few accidents with cracked and shattered disposal jars because of the heat produced by the reacting chemicals he has dropped in there. 

<P>
Frederico has worked up a table of the amount of the temperature changes produced by various pairs of chemicals he has previously put into his disposal jars. (He believes that simultaneous interactions of 3 or more chemicals are insignificant.)

Write a program to read this information and a list of what he is planning to dispose into the jar, and to print the maximum temperature change that may be produced.

You are competing with another company for a city contract to fill potholes in the city streets. 

<P>
The city has set up a contest in which you will compete in a rectangular parking lot containing a large number of potholes to see which company can work faster. 

<P>
You are to stretch a rope from one end of the lot to the other, dividing the lot into two rectangles. Your opponent will then choose which side of the lot they wish to work in, while you work in the other side. Obviously, then, you need to try can divide the lot so that the amount of work to be done (total area of all potholes) on each side is as nearly equal as possible. 

<P>
For the purposes of this problem, potholes will be modeled as circles. Potholes do not overlap one another or the edges of the parking lot. Your chosen placement of the rope may not cross a pothole. Potholes may, however, be tangent to one another, to the edges of the lot, or to the rope.

<P>An extensive area of research in computer science is the field of communications. With computer networks being part of everyday life of many people, the development of ways for making networks faster, more reliable and secure is constantly needed. This practical need motivates an extensive research activity in the theory behind communications.<P>The very first thing needed to establish any kind of communication is a common code. A code is a way of changing the <SPAN CLASS="textit">form</SPAN> of a piece of information into some other form, in general to make it possible to convey that piece of information from one place to another. Flag codes used by boats and the Morse code used in telegraphy are examples of codes for translating letters into different forms to enable communication over different media.<P>More formally, a code is a set of strings composed of symbols from one alphabet. Each string defined in the code is called a code word. A message is then composed concatenating a set of code words to convey the information needed. For example, in Morse code the alphabet is composed of the symbols hyphen and dot; letter ``<TT>S</TT>" is represented by the code word ``<TT>...</TT>", letter ``<TT>O</TT>" is represented by the code word ``<TT>--</TT>", and therefore the distress message ``<TT>SOS</TT>" in Morse code is ``<TT>...--...</TT>".<P>Codes for communication can have many desirable and undesirable properties such as ambiguity, entropy, redundancy, and many more. In this problem we will focus on ambiguity as a key property.<P>A code is <SPAN CLASS="textit">ambiguous</SPAN> when there exists a message using that code that can be partitioned into different sequences of code words. In other words, in an ambiguous code a message may have more than one meaning. For example, consider the binary alphabet, composed of symbols {<TT>0</TT>,<TT>1</TT>}. For the code composed of the words {<TT>10</TT>, <TT>01</TT>, <TT>101</TT>} the message <TT>10101</TT> can be understood as <TT>10-101</TT> or <TT>101-01</TT> and therefore the code is ambiguous. On the other hand, for the code composed of the words {<TT>01</TT>, <TT>10</TT>, <TT>011</TT>} no ambiguous message exists and therefore the code is unambiguous.<P>As a part of the computer science community, you are required to develop a tester that checks if codes are ambiguous. In case a code is indeed ambiguous, you are also required to report the length (i.e. the number of symbols) of the shortest ambiguous message for that code.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>Each test case will consist on several lines.

The ICPC world finals will be held in a luxurious hotel with a big ballroom. A buffet meal will be served in this ballroom, and organizers decided to decorate its walls with pictures of past champion teams. 

<P>
In order to avoid criticism about favouring some of those teams over others, the organizing commitee wants to make sure that all pictures are appropiately illuminated. The only direct way they've found for doing this is ensuring each picture has at least one lightbulb that directly illuminates it. 

<P>
In this way, the perimeter of the ballroom wall can be divided into illuminated parts (in which pictures may be placed) and dark parts (which are not suitable for placing the pictures). 

<P>
The ballroom has the shape of a box and contains several lightbulbs. Each lightbulb emits light in all directions, but this light can be blocked by columns. All columns in the ballroom have cylindrical shape and go from the floor to the ceiling, so light cannot pass over or above them. Columns are of course placed so that its circular section is parallel to the ballroom floor. Any given point <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> on the perimeter wall is said to be illuminated if there exists a line segment (a light ray) which starts on a lightbulb, ends in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and does not touch or pass through any column.

<P>Martin and Isa are very competitive. The newest competition they have created is about looking at the plates of the cars. Each time one of them sees a car plate in the streets, he or she sends to the other an SMS message with the content of that plate; the one who has seen the newest plate is in the lead of the game. As the Automobile Car Management (ACM) office assigns the plates sequentially in increasing order, they can compare them and find out who is the winner.<P>Martin has a very smart eye and he has stayed on the lead for several weeks. Maybe he keeps looking at the streets instead of working, or maybe he stays all day in front of car selling companies waiting for new cars to go out with new plates. Isa, tired of being always behind, has written a program that generates a random plate, so the next time Martin sends a message to her, she will respond with this generated plate. In this way, she hopes to give Martin a hard time trying to beat her.<P>However, Martin has grown suspicious, and he wants to determine if Isa actually saw a car with the plate she sent or not. This way, he will know if Isa is in the lead of the game.<P>He knows some facts about the plates assigned by the ACM:<P><P><BR><UL><LI>Each plate is a combination of 7 characters, which may be uppercase letters (A-Z), or digits (0-9). </LI><LI>There exists two kinds of plate schemes: the old one, used for several years, and the new one which has been in use for some months, when the combinations of the old one were exhausted. </LI><LI>In the old scheme, the first three characters were letters, and the last four were digits, so the plates run from AAA0000 to ZZZ9999. </LI><LI>In the new scheme, the first five characters are letters, and the last two are digits. Unfortunately the chief of ACM messed up with the printing system while he was trying to create a poster for his next campaign for mayor, and the printer is not able to write the letters A, C, M, I, and P. Therefore, in this new scheme, the first plate is BBBBB00, instead of AAAAA00. </LI><LI>The plates are assigned following a sequential order. As a particular case, the last plate from the old scheme is followed by the first plate from the new scheme. </LI></UL><P><P><BR>As Isa is not aware of all of this, she has just made sure that her random generator creates a combination consisting of seven characters, where the first three characters are always uppercase letters, the last two characters are always digits, and each one of the fourth and fifth characters may be an uppercase letter or a digit (possibly generating an illegal combination, but she has not much time to worry about that).<P>Of course, Martin will not consider Isa the winner if he receives an illegal combination, or if he receives a legal plate, but equal to or older than his. But that's not all of it. Since Martin knows that new plates are not generated too fast, he will not believe that Isa saw a car with a plate newer than the one he sent, but sequentially too far. For example, if Martin sends DDDDD45, and receives ZZZZZ45, he will not believe that Isa saw a car with that plate, because he knows that the ACM couldn't have printed enough plates to get to ZZZZZ45 in the time he received that answer.<P>So, Martin has decided to consider Isa the winner only if he receives a legal plate, newer than his, and older than or equal to the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th consecutive plate after the one he sent. He calls <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> his <SPAN CLASS="textit">confidence number</SPAN>. For example, if Martin sends ABC1234, and his confidence number is 6, he will think that Isa is the winner only if he receives any plate newer than ABC1234, but older than or equal to ABC1240.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several test cases.

<P>
The inhabitants of a small Caribbean island in the region known as Bermuda's Triangle love to spend their warm summer nights playing cards. As a tribute to the region where they live, all of their card games have some connection to triangles. One of the most popular games in the island is known as Triples, and has very simple rules. 

<P>
The game is played between two players, with a set of standard playing cards. Cards are distinguished only by their values, from 1 (Ace) to 13 (King). The cards are shuffled and placed as a pile in the center of the table, face down. This pile is called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">stock</SPAN>. The two players take turns at playing. At each turn, a player 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>draws the top card from the stock, adding it to her/his hand; and 
</LI>
<LI>decides whether she/he wants to ``drop some triples". 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Dropping a triple consists of choosing three cards (a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">triple</SPAN>) from the hand and placing them on the table, face up. The dropped triples stay on the table until the end of the game. Only some sets of three cards form a valid triple. There are two types of valid triples: 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Perfect triples</SPAN> are made of three cards whose values represent the length of sides of an equilateral triangle; 
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Common triples</SPAN> are made by three cards whose values represent the length of sides of any other (not equilateral) triangle. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The figure below shows examples of perfect triples (a), common triples (b), and invalid triples (c).

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>
</DIV>

<P>
Only valid triples can be dropped, but a player may drop any number of triples at a given turn. In particular, since players know the number of cards in the stock at every turn, a player may decide to drop all triples in her/his last turn. Some players, however, normally drop some triples during the game, to maintain as few cards in their hands as possible. 

<P>
The game finishes when the stock is empty. The winner is the player that dropped the largest number of perfect triples. If both players dropped the same number of perfect triples, the winner is the player that dropped the largest number of common triples. If both players dropped the same number of perfect triples and the same number of common triples, the result is a tie. 

<P>
Given the description of the cards in the stock, write a program that determines the winner of a game of Triples, considering both players play as best as possible.

Emoticons are used in chat and e-mail conversations to try to express the emotions that printed words cannot. This may seem like a nice feature for many, but a lot of people find it really annoying and wants to get rid of emoticons. 

<P>
George is one of those people. He hates emoticons so bad, that he is preparing a plan to remove all emoticons from all e-mails in the world. Since you share his visionary plans, you are preparing a special program to help him. 

<P>
Your program will receive the list of emoticons to proscribe. Each emoticon will be a string of characters not including any whitespace. You will also receive several lines of text. What you need to do is change some characters of the text into spaces to ensure no emoticon is left on the text. For an emoticon to be considered to appear in the text it has to appear in a single line and be made of consecutive characters. 

<P>
To help George's plan remain secret as long as possible, you need to do your job with the minimum possible amount of character changes.

<P>
The famous witch is back. After killing an incredible amount of monsters in order to find a hidden treasure, Zak Galou decided to buy vineyards in Burgundy and retired. Everything was calm in his new life, until the day that his farm tractor stopped working. 

<P>
His tractor's engine works based on a mechanism of gears. The engine can be represented by a bidimensional grid. At most one gear can be attached to each position of the grid. All the gears are identical and can mesh with adjacent gears. In this grid, a gear can have up to six other adjacent gears, see figure below:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<IMG
 WIDTH="575" HEIGHT="294" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/39/p3933a.jpg
 ALT="\epsfbox{p3933a.eps}">
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>
</DIV>

<P>
Under normal utilization, when the tractor is started, some of the gears are initially activated and try to turn clockwise. When a gear tries to turn in one direction, all the adjacent gears try to turn in the opposite direction. 

<P>
When Zak Galou opened his engine he noticed that it had been sabotaged (probably by a jealous treasure hunter who was not able to find the treasure). Some of the gears were removed from the engine and others have been added to it. As a consequence, some of the gears were immobile. A gear can be immobile either if it is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">free</SPAN> or if it is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">blocked</SPAN>. A gear is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">free</SPAN> when it is not an initially activated gear and no adjacent gear is trying to turn. A gear is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">blocked</SPAN> when it is trying to turn in both directions at the same time. For example, consider that there are three gears in the engine as shown in the figure below. If any of the gears is initially activated when the tractor is started, all of them will be blocked. If none of the gears are initially activated, all of them will be free.

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>
</DIV>

<P>
As a part of the work of fixing his tractor, Zak Galou asks for your help to solve the following problem. Given the description of the engine and the gears that are initially activated in the clockwise direction, he wants to know for each gear, what is its state when the tractor is started: turn clockwise, turn counter-clockwise, free or blocked.

<P>Charles is the contest director for the ICPC Tumbolian regional contest. His responsibility is ensuring the contest flows smoothly, that the contest rules are applied fairly, and, of course, announcing the final contest ranking.<P>According to ICPC rules, a team with more solved problems ranks above a team with less solved problems. If two teams have the same number of solved problems, the team with the smaller total penalty ranks above the team with the larger total penalty (in case both teams have the same number of solved problems and the same penalty, Charles considers them as tied).<P>The <SPAN CLASS="textit">total penalty</SPAN> for a team is the sum of all the problem penalties of the problems that team has solved. The problem penalty for a problem is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>TP</I> + <I>EP</I>&#215;<I>FA</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>TP</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the time penalty for that problem, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>EP</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the contest's error penalty and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>FA</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the number of failed attempts at solving the problem before submitting a correct solution.<P>The <SPAN CLASS="textit">time penalty</SPAN> for a problem is the time since the start of the contest, in minutes, that the team needed to solve the problem. The <SPAN CLASS="textit">error penalty</SPAN> is a positive integer chosen by the contest director, designed to reward teams that submit correct solutions on the first attempt.<P>Charles wants to change the error penalty from the ``standard" value of 20 minutes to stir things up. To study the effects of that change on the final rankings, he wants to know the range of error penalties that <SPAN CLASS="textit">don't</SPAN> change the final standings.<P>In other words, if team A is ahead of team B in the original standings, then A should be ahead of B in the modified standings; if A and B are tied in the original standings, they should also be tied in the modified standings (the original standings are the ones obtained with an error penalty of 20 minutes).<P>Charles has been very busy organizing the Tumbolian regional, so he asked you to make a program that will compute the range for him.<P><H2><FONT size=4 COLOR=#ff0000><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT></H2><P>The input contains several test cases.

Thirty five years ago, a group of super heroes was chosen to form the Justice League, whose purpose was to protect the planet Earth from the villains. After all those years helping mankind, its members are retiring and now it is time to choose the new members of the Justice League. 

<P>
In order to keep their secret identity, let's say, secret, super heroes usually use an integer number to identify themselves. There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> super heroes on Earth, identified with the integers from 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. With a brief look at the newspapers anyone can find out if two super heroes have already worked together in a mission. If this happened, we say that the two heroes have a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">relationship</SPAN>. 

<P>
There must be only one Justice League in the world, which could be formed by any number of super heroes (even only one). Moreover, for any two heroes in the new league, they <SPAN  CLASS="textit">must</SPAN> have a relationship. 

<P>
Besides, consider the set of the heroes not chosen to take part in the Justice League. For any two heroes on that set, they <SPAN  CLASS="textit">must not</SPAN> have a relationship. This prevents the formation of unofficial justice leagues. 

<P>
You work for an agency in charge of creating the new Justice League. The agency doesn't know if it is possible to create the League with the restrictions given, and asked for your programming skills. Given a set of super heroes and their relationships, determine if it is possible to select any subset to form the Justice League, according to the given restrictions.

After doing Ray a great favor to collect sticks for Ray, Poor Neal becomes very hungry. In return for Neal's help, Ray makes a great dinner for Neal. When it is time for dinner, Ray arranges all the dishes he makes in a single line (actually this line is very long <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the dishes are represented by 1, 2, 3 <SPAN CLASS="MATH">...</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>). ``You make me work hard and don't pay me! You refuse to teach me Latin Dance! Now it is time for you to serve me", Neal says to himself. 

<P>
Every dish has its own value represented by an integer whose absolute value is less than 1,000,000,000. Before having dinner, Neal is wondering about the total value of the dishes he will eat. So he raises many questions about the values of dishes he would have. 

<P>
For each question Neal asks, he will first write down an interval <SPAN CLASS="MATH">[<I>a</I>, <I>b</I>]</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (inclusive) to represent all the dishes <!-- MATH
 $a, a+1, \ldots , b$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I>, <I>a</I> + 1,..., <I>b</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> are positive integers, and then asks Ray which sequence of consecutive dishes in the interval has the most total value. Now Ray needs your help.

<P>As you may know, a <SPAN CLASS="textit">palindrome</SPAN> is a word (or string) that is the same both forwards and backwards.

A number of people are all perched in a tree, each on their own branch. They also each have a saw in their hands. Their objective is that each saws through their neighbourÃ¢Â€Â™s branch until their neighbour falls. However, not every branch takes as long to saw through, so in the end there may still be some people in the tree while everyone else would have fallen (together with their branch and saw) to the ground. 

<P>
When a personÃ¢Â€Â™s branch gets cut all the way through, they will obviously not be able to continue cutting through their neighbourÃ¢Â€Â™s branch, as they would have fallen to the ground and the branches are out of their reach (they would probably also be in a bit of pain after the fall). Also, nobody moves off their current branch, and everyone cuts at the same rate. 

<P>
As everyone sits in a circle, everyone is able to cut their neighbourÃ¢Â€Â™s branch. 

<P>
Each person always cuts the branch of the neighbour to their right.

It is the year 2031 and you run a fairly profitable business dropping aid packages in remote areas. In the old days, aid drops were done using parachutes; nowadays the process has become a lot more streamlined with the invention of the kinetic hoop. 

<P>
The kinetic hoop is a device that can ``catch" a rapidly moving object, provided the object is dropped through the ``hoop" with sufficient precision. As an added bonus, the kinetic hoop converts the kinetic energy of the incoming object into stored electricity, thus allowing the hoop to operate maintenancefree in remote areas. 

<P>
You are a firm believer in hacking together your own equipment, so you have decided to develop your own cargo release mechanism for the latest addition to your Ã¯Â¬Â‚eet (an aeroplane affectionately known as ``Dogbert"). 

<P>
A critical component of the the cargo release system is the computer that calculates the exact release time that will ensure that the cargo will pass safely through the target hoop. Figure 1 illustrates the scenario. 

<P>
Note that it is assumed that your navigation system will align your Ã¯Â¬Â‚ight path so that you will pass directly over the kinetic hoop, and that your vertical velocity will be zero at the time of release. All that remains now is the calculation of the exact value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the distance from the target at which you must release the cargo. 

<P>
Fortunately you are familiar with the linear drag equations, so you can calculate the correct cargo release distance, given your current altitude and horizontal speed. In the following equations, capital letters denote vectors (2-dimensional, in this case), and lower case letters denote scalars. The equation describing the position of the centroid of the aid package at time <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is

Every so often we hear on the news that there is going to be either a solar or lunar eclipse. Eclipses have a long history dating back well into the BCÃ¢Â€Â™s. Astronomers study total solar eclipses very closely as they provide the rare opportunity to observe the corona. 

<P>
An eclipse occurs when two celestial bodies and a star are (nearly) linearly aligned and the shadow cast by the one body intersects the other body, creating darkness on the latter body. 

<P>
We are interested in determining when a solar eclipse will next occur. In Figure 1 you can see two labelled regions. The umbra is the area of total darkness - a body in this region will experience a total solar eclipse. The penumbra is the area of partial darkness - a body in this region will experience a partial solar eclipse. 

<P>
You will be given the size and location of a star and two celestial bodies. Your task is to determine if the first celestial body creates a solar eclipse on the second celestial body. If it does then you are to determine whether it is a total or partial eclipse and whether the entire body is in eclipse. If part of the body is experiencing total eclipse while the entire body is experiencing at least a partial eclipse, we are only interested in the part that is in total eclipse. 

<P>
Consider a scaled model of our solar system with the sun at the origin (0, 0, 0) with radius 700, the moon at position (49900, 1000, 149700) with radius 2 and Earth at position (50000, 1000, 150000) with radius 7. In Figure 1, the sun would be the star on the left and the moon would be the smaller body on the right. Part of Earth would then fall in the black umbra region and hence partly experience a total solar eclipse.

You are developing a computer-based Scrabble game. Only one part of the program is still incomplete: the computer opponent. You have decided on a heuristic-based algorithm for choosing the computer opponentÃ¢Â€Â™s next move. Your heuristic requires the evaluation of all the anagrams of a given word. 

<P>
An anagram of a word is a permutation of the letters that forms another valid word. For example, ``sale" would be one possible anagram of the word ``seal". Note that words do not include any spaces, so only single-word anagrams will be considered. 

<P>
Your Scrabble game already uses a dictionary to keep the players honest, so the validity of a given permutation can be tested against this very same dictionary.

Your input will consist of an arbitrary number of records. Each record will consist of two parts: a ``dictionary" of words, and a ``target list" of words. The dictionary of words will be presented as a list of words, one per line. The end of the dictionary is indicated by a line containing the string ``<TT>-1</TT>", after which the target words will be listed. The target words are listed one per line, with the end of the record indicated by a line containing the string ``<TT>-2</TT>". After a ``<TT>-2</TT>", the pattern may repeat, with the next line containing the first word from the next recordÃ¢Â€Â™s dictionary, followed by the rest of the next record. Alternatively, the file may end after the last ``<TT>-2</TT>" in the input data set.

<P>You work in a population genetics lab, studying the effects of applying cosmetics to furry animals (on their health, not on their social lives). One day when you try to open a database of results, you realise that a power glitch has corrupted your files.<P>After looking at the raw data, you realise that the effect of the data corruption was that your experiment labels have been shuffled. In other words, you no longer know whether a set of results belong to experiments conducted on rabbits, rats, or an experiment which included both rats and rabbits.<P>Fortunately, one of the fields in each set of results is the monthly population size of the experimental group. You begin to ponder if it may be possible to identify what the experimental label should be, given the population numbers.<P>You recall that rabbits multiply at a fixed rate. In other words, if you start with two rabbits, they will produce one little rabbit every month. The baby rabbits take one month to mature, after which they start reproducing at the same rate.

<P>The marketing and public-relations department of the Czech Technical University has designed a new reconfigurable mechanical Flip-Flop Bill-Board (FFBB). The billboard is a regular twodimensional grid of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I>&#215;<I>C</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> square tiles made of plastic. Each plastic tile is white on one side and black on the other. The idea of the billboard is that you can create various pictures by flipping individual tiles over. Such billboards will hang above all entrances to the university and will be used to display simple pictures and advertise upcoming academic events.<P>To change pictures, each billboard is equipped with a ``reconfiguration device". The device is just an ordinary long wooden stick that is used to tap the tiles. If you tap a tile, it flips over to the other side, i.e., it changes from white to black or vice versa. Do you agree this idea is very clever?<P>Unfortunately, the billboard makers did not realize one thing. The tiles are very close to each other and their sides touch. Whenever a tile is tapped, it takes all neighboring tiles with it and all of them flip over together. Therefore, if you want to change the color of a tile, all neighboring tiles change their color too. Neighboring tiles are those that touch each other with the whole side. All inner tiles have 4 neighbors, which means 5 tiles are flipped over when tapped. Border tiles have less neighbors, of course.<P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="431" HEIGHT="128" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="http://livearchive.onlinejudge.org/external/39/p3953.png ALT="\epsfbox{p3953.eps}"> <tex2html_verbatim_mark></DIV><P>For example, if you have the billboard configuration shown in the left picture above and tap the tile marked with the cross, you will get the picture on the right.

The land is divided into a regular ``grid" of hexagonal parcels, each of them forms an independent unit and has the same value. Some of the parcels belong to the investor. These parcels form four connected areas, each containing one building to be connected with the others. Your task is to find the minimal number of parcels that must be acquired to connect the four given areas.

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> lines representing individual ``rows" of the land (always oriented as in the picture). The lines contain one non-space character for each parcel. It means the first line will contain <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> characters, the second line <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>H</I> + 1</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and so on. The longest line will be the middle one, with <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2*<I>H</I> - 1</SPAN>

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> parcels, again. 

<P>
The character representing a parcel will be either a dot (``<TT>.</TT>") for the land that is not owned by the investor, or one of the uppercase letters ``<TT>A</TT>", ``<TT>B</TT>", ``<TT>C</TT>", or ``<TT>D</TT>". The areas of parcels occupied by the same letter will always be connected. It means that between any two parcels in the same area, there exists a path leading only through that area. 

<P>
Beside the characters representing parcels, the lines may contain any number of spaces at any positions to improve ``human readability" of the input. There is always at least one space between two letters (or the dots). After the land description, there will be one empty line and then the next scenario begins. The last scenario is followed by a line containing zero.

The Department of Computer Science and Engineering runs courses dealing not only with algorithms but also with computer hardware. One such introductory course explains basic principles of integrated circuits (``chips"), binary logic, boolean algebra, etc. As you may know, the very basic units of logical circuits are called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">gates</SPAN>. A gate is an element performing one simple logical operation. It can be connected to other gates using <SPAN  CLASS="textit">lines</SPAN>.

<P>

</DIV>

<P>
Logical circuits may be drawn as pictures with the gates represented as squares with inputs on the left and outputs on the right. In each square, there is a symbol that determines the gate type: Number <TT>1</TT> denotes an OR gate (its outputs are 0 if and only if there is no input with the value of 1), <TT>&amp;</TT> is an AND gate (outputs are 1 if and only if there is no 0 input), and <TT>=</TT> is a XOR gate (outputs are 1 if and only if there is an odd number inputs that have the value of 1). 

<P>
Your task is to scan such a ``picture" and compute values of all named circuit outputs. The lines may split and join again but you may assume that each ``value consumer" (input port of a gate or a named output) will be connected to exactly one ``value source" (output port of a gate or an input value). There will be no feedback loops, i.e., there exists no cycle that would lead through the same gate twice.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
The input contains several pictures. Each picture consists of at least one and at most 200 rows composed of the following characters: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Space</SPAN> (`` "). Empty space in the picture. Spaces are used to indent other characters to appropriate locations, because the exact position of characters is often important. Trailing spaces at the end of input rows may be present but may also be left out. 
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Dash</SPAN> (``<TT>-</TT>"). Horizontal line. It connects characters on its left and right together, those characters will always exist and be able to ``accept" the connection. 
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Pipe</SPAN> (``<TT>|</TT>"). Vertical line, connects characters that are directly above and below. Like with the horizontal line, those characters will always accept the connection. 
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Plus sign</SPAN> (``<TT>+</TT>"). Line connection or a bend. Connects characters on all four sides. All characters that are able to accept the connection are considered connected (there will always be at least two). However, there may be sides that contain a non-empty character that is not connected. For example, if a dash is present on a position directly below the plus sign, they are not considered connected. 
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Lowercase letter x</SPAN> (``<TT>x</TT>"). Crossing of two lines without a connection. All four neighboring characters will accept the connection. The character above is connected to the one below and the character to the left with the one on the right, but there is no mutual connection between these two pairs.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Equal sign</SPAN> (``<TT>=</TT>"). Represents an input or output port. It always connects characters on its left and right, at least one of these characters is the port. If there is a port on the left, it may only be a value source. If there is a port on the right, it may only be a value consumer.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Lowercase letter o</SPAN> (``<TT>o</TT>"). Negation. There will always be a gate on the left and a port on the right of this character. It makes the particular gate output negated. 
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Hash mark</SPAN> (``<TT>#</TT>"). Gate, which has always a rectangular shape with two vertical and two horizontal sides. The left vertical side may be connected to input ports, the right side to output ports (possibly negated). No two gates will touch each other's side, which means that any two vertically or horizontally neighboring hash marks are always parts of the same gate. 

<P>
The rectangle size will always be at least 3 characters in both directions, which means there is at least one character inside. All inner characters are empty (spaces), with exactly one exception. That single non-empty character denotes the gate type (note that it may have different meaning than outside the gate area) and will be a digit ``one" (``<TT>1</TT>"), ampersand (``<TT>&amp;</TT>"), or an equal sign (``<TT>=</TT>"). 
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Binary digit</SPAN> (``<TT>0</TT>" and ``<TT>1</TT>"). Input value of the circuit. It is connected to the character on its right, which is always an equal sign. 
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Uppercase letter</SPAN> (``<TT>A</TT>" through ``<TT>Z</TT>"). Named output of the circuit. It accepts connection from its left, which is always an equal sign. Each letter will appear at most once, which means the number of circuit outputs is between 0 and 26, inclusive. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Each picture will be terminated by a row consisting solely of asterisk (``<TT>*</TT>") characters (at least one). The last picture will be followed by two such rows. No row in the input will be longer than 200 characters.

<P>Binary numbers form the principal basis of computer science. Most of you have heard of other systems, such as ternary, octal, or hexadecimal. You probably know how to use these systems and how to convert numbers between them. But did you know that the system base (radix) could also be negative? One assistant professor at the Czech Technical University has recently met <SPAN CLASS="textit">negabinary</SPAN> numbers and other systems with a negative base. Will you help him to convert numbers to and from these systems?<P>A number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> written in the system with a positive base <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> will always appear as a string of digits between 0 and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I> - 1</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, inclusive. A digit at the position <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> (positions are counted from right to left and starting with zero) represents a value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I><SUP>P</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> . This means the value of the digit is multiplied by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I><SUP>P</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> and values of all positions are summed together. For example, if we use the octal system (radix <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I> = 8</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>), a number written as 17024 has the following value:<P><P></P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay">1*8<SUP>4</SUP> +7*8<SUP>3</SUP> +0*8<SUP>2</SUP> +2*8<SUP>1</SUP> +4*8<SUP>0</SUP> = 1*4096 + 7*512 + 2*8 + 4*1 = 7700</DIV><P><tex2html_verbatim_mark></P><P>With a negative radix <SPAN CLASS="MATH">- <I>R</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the principle remains the same: each digit will have a value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(- <I>R</I>)<SUP>P</SUP></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>. For example, a negaoctal (radix <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>R</I> = - 8</SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark>) number 17024 counts as:<P><P></P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay">1*(- 8)<SUP>4</SUP> +7*(- 8)<SUP>3</SUP> +0*(- 8)<SUP>2</SUP> +2*(- 8)<SUP>1</SUP> +4*(- 8)<SUP>0</SUP> = 1*4096 - 7*512 - 2*8 + 4*1 = 500</DIV><P><tex2html_verbatim_mark></P><P>One big advantage of systems with a negative base is that we do not need a minus sign to express negative numbers.

Roshambo -- this simple game is known all around the world. In German, it is called ``Schnick, Schnack, Schnuck", in Japanese ``Janken", in Spanish ``Cachip&#250;n", in Polish ``Papier, kamien, nozyce". The Czechs call it ``K&#225;men, nuzky, pap&#237;r". 

<P>
Whatever is the name of the game, its principles remain the same. Two players simultaneously form their hand into one of three possible shapes (symbols): Rock (closed fist), Paper (open hand), or Scissors (two fingers extended). If both of them show the same symbol, it is a tie and no points are given. Otherwise, one of the symbols wins: Rock blunts Scissors, Scissors cut Paper, and Paper covers Rock. 

<P>
Czech Technical University students also know the game very well and use it to resolve small disputes. Imagine, for example, two students living together in one room. Yesterday evening, there was a small celebration, and in the morning, no one wants to go to the lectures. They agreed that one person would be enough to take notices for both, but who will be the poor one? Roshambo is a very effective way to decide. 

<P>
Did you know there are even the World Series of Roshambo? Our organizing team would like to host the World Championships in 2009. Your task is to help us in developing a Roshambo scoring system and write a program that evaluates one game between two players. 

<P>
Since the participants will come from different countries, the system must accept input in various languages. The following table shows names of three Roshambo symbols. Note that in some languages, there may be two different words for the same symbol.

Somewhere deep in the Czech Technical University buildings, there are laboratories for examining mechanical and electrical properties of various materials. In one of yesterday's presentations, you have seen how was one of the laboratories changed into a new multimedia lab. But there are still others, serving to their original purposes. 

<P>
In this task, you are to write software for a robot that handles samples in such a laboratory. Imagine there are material samples lined up on a running belt. The samples have different heights, which may cause troubles to the next processing unit. To eliminate such troubles, we need to sort the samples by their height into the ascending order. 

<P>
Reordering is done by a mechanical robot arm, which is able to pick up any number of consecutive samples and turn them round, such that their mutual order is reversed. In other words, one robot operation can reverse the order of samples on positions between <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. 

<P>
A possible way to sort the samples is to find the position of the smallest one (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>) and reverse the order between positions 1 and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, which causes the smallest sample to become first. Then we find the second one on position <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and reverse the order between 2 and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Then the third sample is located etc.

<P>
The picture shows a simple example of 6 samples. The smallest one is on the 4th position, therefore, the robot arm reverses the first 4 samples. The second smallest sample is the last one, so the next robot operation will reverse the order of five samples on positions 2-6. The third step will be to reverse the samples 3-4, etc. 

<P>
Your task is to find the correct sequence of reversal operations that will sort the samples using the above algorithm. If there are more samples with the same height, their mutual order must be preserved: the one that was given first in the initial order must be placed before the others in the final order too.

Czech Technical University has the word ``technical" in its name. Beside others, this means that lectures in physics are important here. Do you still remember some of the basic physical principles? 

<P>
For example, imagine a simple glass of water. Or, we will rather call it a cup to avoid ambiguity of this word. So, imagine a simple cup (made of glass) that is partially filled with water. You might have noticed that the stability of such a cup depends on the amount of water inside. If you brush against a full cup, it is relatively easy to knock it down and spill its contents. If the cup is empty, there is fortunately nothing to be spilled, but other than that, the situation does not improve much - it is still easy to knock the cup down with only a little force. The best stability is usually achieved with a ``half-full" cup. 

<P>
In this problem, your task is to determine the water level that makes a cup as much stable as possible. For the purpose of this problem, we will make a simple assumption that the ``stability" of a cup is higher, if its center of mass (sometimes also called the center of gravity) is lower (closer to the bottom). 

<P>
The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">center of mass</SPAN> can be informally defined as follows: Imagine that glass and water consist of a very large number of very small particles. Then the center of mass is an average of the position of all these particles. The average is weighted by particle masses. Since the density of glass is approximately <!-- MATH
 $2 500 \ kg.m^{-3}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">2500&nbsp;<I>kg</I>.<I>m</I><SUP>-3</SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and the density of water only <!-- MATH
 $1 000 \ kg.m^{-3}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1000&nbsp;<I>kg</I>.<I>m</I><SUP>-3</SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, we will suppose that the mass of a glass particle is 2.5 times higher than the mass of a water particle of the same size. 

<P>
All cups considered in this problem will have an exact rotary shape. But their radius may vary with the height -- some cups are wider at the top, others are wider at the bottom. Also, the thickness of the glass may not be constant.

<P>Roman numerals are an ancient numbering system used extensively throughout Europe through the 13th century (where it was eventually replaced by our current positional system). Vestiges of this system still exist today on clock faces, building cornerstones, Super Bowls and Star Wars episodes.

<P>On an <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I>&#215;<I>m</I></SPAN> <tex2html_verbatim_mark> board there is a lemming on each square.
